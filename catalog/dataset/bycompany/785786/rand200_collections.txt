785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S5	Many of our customers products require complex configuration management and direct order fulfillment to their customers across the globe.
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S6	In such cases we provide global logistics management and after-market service and repair.
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S7	Our customers products may have stringent requirements for quality, reliability and regulatory compliance.
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S8	We offer our customers the ability to outsource all phases of product realization, including product specifications; development, design and design verification; regulatory compliance support; prototyping and new product introduction; manufacturing test equipment development; materials sourcing, procurement and supply-chain management; product assembly/manufacturing, configuration and test; order fulfillment, logistics and service/repair.
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S9	Plexus is passionate about its goal to be the leading EMS company in the world at servicing mid-to-low volume, higher complexity customer programs characterized by unique flexibility, technology, quality and regulatory requirements.
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S10	We have aligned our business operations, processes, workforce and financial metrics to support this strategy.
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S11	We operate flexible manufacturing facilities and processes designed to accommodate customers with multiple product-lines and configurations.
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S12	Each of our customers are supported by a multi-disciplinary customer team and one or more uniquely configured focus factories supported by a supply-chain and logistics solution specifically designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness required to support that customer s fulfillment requirements.
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S13	Our go-to-market strategy is also tailored to our target market sectors and business strategy, with business development and customer management teams dedicated to each of the five sectors we serve.
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S14	These teams are accountable to understand sector participants, technology, unique quality and regulatory requirements and longer-term trends in these sectors.
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S15	These teams also help set our strategy for growth in these sectors with a particular focus on expanding the services and value-add that we provide customers.
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S16	In addition, our financial model is aligned with our business strategy, with our primary focus to earn a return on invested capital ( ROIC ) 500 basis points in excess of our weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ).
785786_11_ITEM1_P0_S17	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually, and at the end of fiscal 2011 reduced our estimated WACC to 12.5%.
785786_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Lower manufacturing volumes, flexibility and fulfillment requirements, our sector-based go-to-market strategy, and complex quality and regulatory compliance requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs relative to our competitors, particularly those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products with less stringent requirements (such as consumer electronics).
785786_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	By exercising discipline to generate a ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to ensure that Plexus creates value for our shareholders.
785786_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our customers include both industry-leading original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) and other technology companies that have never manufactured products internally.
785786_11_ITEM1_P1_S3	As a result of our focus on serving market sectors that rely on advanced electronics technology, our business is influenced by technological trends such as the level and rate of development of telecommunications infrastructure, the expansion of networks and use of the Internet.
785786_11_ITEM1_P1_S4	In addition, the federal Food and Drug Administration s approval of new medical devices, defense procurement practices and other governmental approval and regulatory processes can affect our business.
785786_11_ITEM1_P1_S5	Our business has also benefited from the trend to increased outsourcing by OEMs.
785786_11_ITEM1_P1_S6	We provide most of our contract manufacturing services on a turnkey basis, which means that we procure some or all of the materials required for product assembly.
785786_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	Turnkey services require material procurement and warehousing, in addition to manufacturing, and involve greater resource investments than consignment services.
785786_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Other than certain test equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
785786_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	Established in 1979 as a Wisconsin corporation, we have approximately 9,000 full-time employees, including approximately 1,700 engineers and technologists dedicated to product development and design, test equipment development and design, and manufacturing process development and control, all of whom operate from 24 active facilities in 15 locations, totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet.
785786_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	These facilities are strategically located to support the global supply chain, manufacturing and engineering needs of customers in our targeted market sectors.
785786_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	We maintain a website at www.plexus.com .
785786_11_ITEM1_P3_S4	We make available through that website, free of charge, copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file those materials with, or furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
785786_11_ITEM1_P3_S5	Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics is also posted on our website.
785786_11_ITEM1_P3_S6	You may access these SEC reports and the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics by following the links under Investor Relations at our website.
785786_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	Services Plexus offers a broad range of integrated services as more fully described below; our customers may utilize any, or all, of the following services and tend to use more of these services as their outsourcing strategies mature: Product development and design.
785786_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	We provide comprehensive conceptual design and value-engineering services.
785786_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	These product design services include program management, feasibility studies, product conceptualization, specification development for product features and functionality, circuit design (including digital, microprocessor, power, analog, radio frequency (RF), optical and micro-electronics), field programmable gate array design (FPGA), printed circuit board layout, embedded software design, mechanical design (including thermal analysis, fluidics, robotics, plastic components, sheet metal enclosures, and castings), development of test specifications and product verification testing.

785786_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Prototyping and new product introduction services.
785786_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	We provide assembly of prototype products within our operating sites.
785786_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	We supplement our prototype assembly services with other value-added services, including materials management, analysis of the manufacturability and testability of a design, test implementation and pilot production runs leading to volume production.
785786_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	These services link our engineering and our customers engineering to our volume manufacturing facilities.
785786_11_ITEM1_P7_S3	These links facilitate an efficient transition from engineering to manufacturing.
785786_11_ITEM1_P7_S4	We believe that these services provide significant value to our customers by accelerating their products time-to-market schedule, reducing change activity and providing a robust product set.
785786_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Enhanced product functionality has led to increasingly complex components and assembly techniques; consequently, there is a need to design and assemble increasingly complex in-circuit and functional test equipment for electronic products and assemblies.
785786_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our internal development of this test equipment allows us to rapidly specify, implement, maintain and enhance test solutions that efficiently test printed circuit assemblies, subassemblies, system assemblies and finished products.
785786_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	to environmentally stress-test products during functional testing to assure reliability.
785786_11_ITEM1_P8_S3	We believe that the internal design and production of test equipment is an important factor in our ability to provide technology-driven products of consistently high quality.
785786_11_ITEM1_P8_S4	We provide contract manufacturing services on either a turnkey basis, which means we source and procure the materials required for product assembly, or on a consignment basis, which means the customer supplies the materials necessary for product assembly.
785786_11_ITEM1_P8_S5	Turnkey services include materials procurement and warehousing in addition to manufacturing and involve greater resource investment and potential inventory risk than consignment services.
785786_11_ITEM1_P8_S6	Substantially all of our manufacturing services are currently on a turnkey basis.
785786_11_ITEM1_P8_S7	We have the manufacturing services expertise required to assemble very complex electronic products that utilize multiple printed circuit boards and subassemblies.
785786_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	requirements and many are shipped directly to our customers end users.
785786_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	We provide a range of higher level assembly services to our customers; these products typically fall into one of the following categories in our assembly spectrum:
785786_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	Printed circuit board assembly a printed circuit board ( PCB ) populated with electronic components.
785786_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Basic assembly a sub-assembly that includes PCBs and other components.
785786_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	System integration a finished product or sub-system assembly that includes more complex components such as PCB s, basic assemblies, custom engineered components, displays, optics, metering and measurement or thermal management.
785786_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Mechatronic integration more complex system integration that combines electronic controls with mechanical systems and processes such as motion control, robotics, drive systems, fluidics, hydraulics or pneumatics.
785786_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	System integration and mechatronic integration products can be very large and could include products such as kiosks, finished medical products and complex electro-mechanical assemblies.
785786_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	These products often combine many of the other integrated services we provide and may require more unique facility configurations as well as supply chain solutions than we typically employ.
785786_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	We provide fulfillment and logistic services to many of our customers.
785786_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Direct Order Fulfillment ( DOF ) entails receiving orders from our customers that provide the final specifications required by the end-customer.
785786_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	We then Build to Order ( BTO ) and Configure to Order ( CTO ) and deliver the product directly to the end-customer.
785786_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The DOF process relies on Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) systems integrated with those of our customers to manage the overall supply chain from parts procurement through manufacturing and logistics.
785786_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	We provide service support for manufactured products requiring repair and/or upgrades, which may or may not be under a customer s warranty.
785786_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	In support of certain customers, we provide these services for some products which we did not originally manufacture.
785786_11_ITEM1_P16_S3	We provide in and out bound logistics required to support fulfillment and service.
785786_11_ITEM1_P16_S4	In addition, we have developed certain processes and tools to meet industry-specific requirements.
785786_11_ITEM1_P16_S5	Among these are the tools and processes to assemble finished medical devices that meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration Quality Systems Regulation requirements and similar regulatory requirements in other countries.
785786_11_ITEM1_P16_S6	Our manufacturing and engineering facilities are ISO certified to 9001:2008 standards.
785786_11_ITEM1_P16_S7	We have additional certifications and/or registrations held by certain of our facilities in the following regions:
785786_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	JMGP accreditation APAC, AMER, EMEA Customers and Market Sectors Served We provide services to a wide variety of customers, ranging from large multinational companies to smaller emerging technology companies.
785786_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	During fiscal 2011, we served approximately 130 customers.
785786_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	For many customers, we provide design and production capabilities, thereby allowing these customers to concentrate on research and development, concept development, distribution, marketing and sales.
785786_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	This helps accelerate their time to market, reduce their investment in engineering and manufacturing capacity and optimize total product cost.
785786_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Juniper Networks, Inc. ( Juniper ) accounted for 17 percent of our net sales in fiscal 2011, 16 percent in fiscal 2010 and 20 percent in fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009.
785786_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	The loss of any of our major customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.
785786_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Many of our large customers contract with us through independent multiple divisions, subsidiaries, production facilities or locations.
785786_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are not dependent on sales to others.
785786_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	The distribution of our net sales by market sectors is shown in the following table: Although our current business development focus is based on the end-market sectors noted above, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources on a geographic basis (see Note 13 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments).
785786_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	Our array of services for customers in each of these end markets is essentially the same and we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources to particular end markets, nor do we internally track our costs and resources on this basis.
785786_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Materials and Suppliers We typically purchase raw materials, including printed circuit boards and electronic components, from manufacturers and distributors.
785786_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	In addition, under certain circumstances, we will purchase components from brokers, customers or competitors.
785786_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	The key electronic components we purchase include specialized components such as application-specific integrated circuits, semiconductors, interconnect products, electronic subassemblies (including memory modules, power supply modules and cable and wire harnesses), inductors, resistors and capacitors.
785786_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	Along with these electronic components, we also purchase components used in manufacturing and higher-level assembly.
785786_11_ITEM1_P20_S4	These components include molded/formed plastics, sheet metal fabrications, aluminum extrusions, robotics, motors, vision sensors, motion/actuation, fluidics, displays, die castings and various other hardware and fastener components.
785786_11_ITEM1_P20_S5	All of these components range from standard to highly customized and vary widely in terms of market availability and price.
785786_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Occasional component shortages and subsequent allocations by suppliers are an inherent risk of the electronics industry.
785786_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Components shortages have been an issue for the industry and for us in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010; these shortages are discussed more fully in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A herein.
785786_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	We actively manage our business to try to minimize our exposure to material and component shortages.
785786_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	We have a corporate sourcing and procurement organization whose primary purpose is to develop supply-chain sources and create strong supplier alliances to ensure, as much as possible, a steady flow of components at competitive prices.
785786_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	We also have a global expediting and escalation process that we believe provides Plexus the ability to effectively track and manage component shortages.
785786_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	Since we design products and therefore can influence the selection of components used in some new products, component manufacturers often provide us with priority access to materials and components, even during times of shortages.
785786_11_ITEM1_P22_S4	We have undertaken a series of initiatives, including the use of advanced supply chain solutions to improve continuity of supply and supply chain flexibility.
785786_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our new business development is organized around end markets, or market sectors.
785786_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	Each market sector has a team of dedicated resources including a business development vice president, a customer management vice president, sales account executives, customer directors, customer managers, engineering and manufacturing subject matter experts, and market sector analysts.
785786_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our sales and marketing efforts focus on both targeting new customers and expanding business with existing customers.
785786_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	We believe our ability to provide a full range of product realization services is a marketing advantage; our sector teams participate in marketing through direct customer contact and participation in industry events and seminars.
785786_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Competition The market for the services we provide is highly competitive.
785786_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	We compete primarily on the basis of meeting the unique needs of our customers, and providing flexible solutions, timely order fulfillment and strong engineering, testing and production capabilities.
785786_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have many competitors in the EMS industry.
785786_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Larger and more geographically diverse competitors have substantially more resources than we do.
785786_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	Other, smaller competitors primarily compete only in specific sectors, typically within limited geographical areas.
785786_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	We also compete against companies that design or manufacture items in-house.
785786_11_ITEM1_P26_S4	In addition, we compete against foreign, low-labor cost manufacturers.
785786_11_ITEM1_P26_S5	This foreign, low-labor cost competition tends to focus on commodity and consumer-related products, which is not our focus.
785786_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	We own various service marks that we use in our business; these marks are registered in the trademark offices of the United States and other countries.
785786_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Although we own certain patents, they are not currently material to our business.
785786_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	We do not have any material copyrights.
785786_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our integrated ERP platform serves all of our manufacturing sites.
785786_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	This ERP platform augments our other management information systems and includes various software systems to enhance and standardize our ability to translate information from multiple production facilities into operational and financial information as well as create a consistent set of core business applications at our facilities worldwide.
785786_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	We believe the related software licenses are of a general commercial character on terms customary for these types of agreements.
785786_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	We are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to air emission standards and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process.
785786_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state and foreign environmental laws and do not anticipate any significant expenditures in maintaining our compliance; however, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Employees Our employees are one of our primary strengths, and we make a considerable effort to maintain a well-qualified and motivated work force.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	We have been able to offer enhanced career opportunities to many of our employees.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	Our human resources department identifies career objectives and monitors specific skill developments for employees with potential for advancement.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	We invest at all levels of the organization to ensure that employees are well trained.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S4	We have a policy of involvement and consultation with employees at every facility and strive for continuous improvement at all levels.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S5	We employ approximately 9,000 full-time employees.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S6	Given the quick response times required by our customers, we seek to maintain flexibility to scale our operations as necessary to maximize efficiency.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S7	To do so, we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S8	In the United Kingdom, approximately 140 of our employees are covered by union agreements.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S9	These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year, although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S10	Our employees in the United States, Romania, Germany, Malaysia, China and Mexico are not covered by union agreements.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S11	We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities.
785786_11_ITEM1_P31_S12	We believe that our employee relationships are good.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	operating results may vary significantly from period to period.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions and world events.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose any of these customers or if there are problems in those market sectors, our net sales and operating results could decline significantly.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 55 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2011, and 57 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2010.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	For the fiscal year ended October 1, 2011, there was one customer that represented 10 percent or more of our net sales.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our principal customers may vary from period to period, and our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Especially given our discrete number of customers, significant reductions in net sales to any of these customers, the loss of major customers or our failure to make appropriate choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S6	In addition, we focus our net sales to customers in only a few market sectors, and we endeavor to carefully choose those sectors.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Shifts in the performance of a sector served by Plexus, as well as the economic and business conditions that affect the sector, or our failure to choose appropriate sectors can particularly impact Plexus.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S9	For instance, sales in the medical sector are substantially affected by trends in that industry, such as government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the financial health of, and pending changes in the structure of, the U.S. health care sector generally.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Further, potential reductions in U.S. defense spending could substantially affect our opportunities in our Defense/Security/Aerospace sector.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Any weakness in the market sectors in which our customers are concentrated could affect our business and results of operations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S12	In the current economic environment, we are seeing increased merger and acquisition activity that has already affected, and may continue to impact, our customers.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P2_S13	Specifically, two of our significant customers were acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and substantially disengaged in fiscal 2011.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Instability in the global credit markets and continuing economic weakness may adversely affect our earnings, liquidity and financial condition.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Global financial and credit markets have been, and continue to be, unstable and unpredictable.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Worldwide economic conditions have been weak and may deteriorate further.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	For example, substantial credit issues have arisen in the European Union as a result of the sovereign debt crisis and other factors affecting economies worldwide.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	The instability of the markets and weakness of the economy could continue to affect the demand for our customers products, the amount, timing and stability of their product demand from us, the financial strength of our customers and suppliers, their ability or willingness to do business with us, our willingness to do business with them, and/or our suppliers and customers ability to fulfill their obligations to us and/or the ability of us, our customers or our suppliers to obtain credit.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	These factors could adversely affect our operations, earnings and financial condition.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We may experience raw material and component parts shortages and price fluctuations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We do not have any long-term supply agreements.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	At various times, including fiscal 2011, we have experienced raw material and component parts shortages due to supplier capacity constraints or their failure to deliver.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Part shortages were prevalent during portions of fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 across the EMS industry, based on the relatively quick recovery of the demand for technological equipment and the resulting capacity constraints at suppliers; shortages have continued into, and are expected to persist in the future.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Such constraints can also be caused by world events, such as government policies, terrorism, armed conflict and economic recession.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P5_S6	In addition, the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan disrupted the global supply chain for certain components manufactured in Japan that are incorporated in the products we manufacture and the flooding in Thailand during our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 had a similar impact.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P5_S7	While we have yet to experience material adverse effects resulting from these events, the magnitude and duration of the impact on us resulting from these events are not yet known.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the raw materials and component parts used in the assembly process and, in some cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular raw material or component part.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Such suppliers may encounter quality problems or financial difficulties which could preclude them from delivering raw materials or component parts timely or at all.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Some suppliers have ceased doing business due to economic or other circumstances, and more may do so in the future.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Supply shortages and delays in deliveries of raw materials or component parts have in some cases resulted in delayed production of assemblies, which have increased our inventory levels and adversely affected our operating results in certain periods.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	An inability to obtain sufficient inventory on a timely basis could also harm relationships with our customers.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S5	In addition, raw material and component parts that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Certain materials provided to us may be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S7	The need to obtain replacement materials and parts may negatively affect our manufacturing operations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S8	The inadvertent use of any such parts or products may also give rise to liability claims.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Raw material and component part supply shortages and delays in deliveries can also result in increased pricing.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S10	While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in raw material or component part prices and other factors, we typically bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S11	Conversely, raw material and component part price reductions have contributed positively to our operating results in the past.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Plexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and currency risks.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We have operations in many countries; operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate now represent a majority of our revenues.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	These international aspects of our operations, which are likely to increase over time, subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results:
785786_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	regulatory requirements and potential changes to those requirements.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We continue to monitor our risk associated with foreign currency translation and have entered into limited forward contracts to address this risk.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As our international operations expand, our failure to adequately hedge foreign currency transactions and/or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties, tariffs, taxes or limitations on currency or fund transfers.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	operates under the Mexican Maquiladora program, which provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations; we could be adversely affected by changes in that program or our failure to comply with its requirements.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our customers do not make long-term commitments and may cancel or change their production requirements.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	EMS companies must respond quickly to the requirements of their customers.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Customers also cancel requirements, change production quantities, delay production or revise their forecasts for a number of reasons that are beyond our control.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our working capital levels.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred and may continue to occur.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers requirements, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital management, facility requirements, personnel needs and other resource requirements.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S7	The short-term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Since many of our operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our operating results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Moreover, since our margins vary across customers and specific programs, a reduction in demand with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Rapid increases in customer requirements may stress personnel and other capacity resources.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P10_S11	We may not have sufficient resources at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Defense contracting can be subject to extensive procurement processes and other factors that can affect the timing and duration of contracts as well as product demand.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	For example, defense procurement is subject to continued Congressional appropriations for these programs, as well as continued determinations by the Department of Defense regarding whether to continue them.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Products for the military are also subject to continued testing of their operations in the field and changing military operational needs, which could affect the possibility and timing of future orders.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	While those arrangements may result in a significant amount of net sales in a short period of time, they may or may not result in continuing long-term programs or relationships.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Even in the case of continuing long-term programs or relationships, orders in the defense sector can be episodic, can vary significantly from period to period, and are subject to termination.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We have a complex business model, and our failure to properly manage that model could affect our operations and financial results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our business model focuses on products and services in the mid-to-lower-volume, higher-mix segment of the EMS market.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Our customers products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility, necessitating optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solutions across an integrated global platform.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The products we manufacture are also typically complex, highly regulated, and require complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Relative to many of our competitors that manufacture more standardized products with larger production runs, our business model requires a greater degree of attention and resources, including working capital, management and technical personnel, and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse manufacturing, regulatory, and service requirements.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If we fail to effectively manage our business model, we may lose customer confidence and our reputation may suffer.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P12_S6	The Company s reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P12_S7	If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to maintain or expand business opportunities could be impaired and our financial results could suffer on a going-forward basis.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P12_S8	In addition, the complexity of our service model often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations as well as commitments from us to our customers.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P12_S9	If we fail to meet those obligations, it could affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs could affect our operations and financial results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new work for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to opportunities.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	and/or program s fit with our value proposition as well as their end market success.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we make the decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the anticipated costs, risks, and rewards of an opportunity.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The failure to make prudent engagement decisions and/or to establish appropriate terms of engagement could adversely affect our profitability and margins.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Also, there are inherent risks associated with the timing and ultimate realization of a new program s anticipated revenue; these factors can sometimes extend for a significant period.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Some new programs require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and competencies.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We may not meet customer expectations, which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver conforming product on a timely basis.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market acceptance, regulatory approvals and/or economic conditions.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute on a new program s requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our manufacturing services involve inventory risk.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Most of our contract manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required raw materials and component parts.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Excess or obsolete inventory, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In our turnkey operations, we order materials and components based on customer forecasts and/or orders.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	A customer s cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Engineering changes by a customer may result in obsolete raw materials or component parts.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete materials and components and require customers to reimburse us for excess and obsolete inventory, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or be able to collect on these obligations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	These managed inventory programs result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to the risk of enforcing those obligations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction, if any, may seriously harm our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction to adjust to customers needs and market demands.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Plexus regularly contends with these issues and must carefully manage its business to meet customer and market requirements.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P18_S8	If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Expansion can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We expect to open a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia (Penang) during the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and anticipate completing a new manufacturing facility in China (Xiamen) in the second half of fiscal 2012.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have also announced our intention to construct a facility in Romania (Oradea) to replace a leased facility and further expand employment in Germany (Darmstadt).
785786_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If we are unable to effectively manage our currently anticipated growth, or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, we may expand our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Other risks of current or future expansion include:
785786_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the expansion.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	While maintaining multiple facilities or higher levels of employment entail short-term costs, reductions in facilities and/or employment could impair our ability to respond to market improvements or to maintain customer relationships.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S4	When we make decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring charges.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In addition, to meet our customers needs, or to achieve increased efficiencies, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S6	For example, in early fiscal 2009 we ceased operations at our former Ayer, Massachusetts facility and reduced headcount in Juarez, Mexico and other North American facilities, even though we continued to expand in other areas.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Since customers needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location, such as those noted above.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Changes in tax laws, and potential tax disputes, could affect our results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S9	The Company has been granted tax holidays for its Malaysian and Xiamen, China subsidiaries.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S10	These tax holidays expire in 2024 and 2013, respectively, and are subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply and would risk adverse tax consequences if we do not.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P22_S11	The Malaysian Investment Development Authority granted approval to extend our tax holiday in Malaysia for a period of five years through December 31, 2024, subject to certain conditions.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Mexico adopted tax reform legislation that took effect on January 1, 2010, and provides for a temporary increase in its income tax and value added tax rates from 28% to 30% and 15% to 16%, respectively, along with certain other changes.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	While we continue to analyze the impact of this legislation, we do not currently believe it will have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Given the scope of our international operations and our international tax arrangements, proposed changes to the manner in which U.S. based multinational companies are taxed in the U.S. could have a material impact on our operating results and competitiveness.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P23_S5	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations and third party certification requirements.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to extensive government regulation relating to the products we design and manufacture and as to how we conduct our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	These regulations affect the sectors we serve and every aspect of our, and our customers , business, including our labor, employment, workplace safety, environmental and import/export practices, as well as many other facets of our operations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, as a result of customer requirements and the need to enhance our competitive position, we seek to obtain and maintain various certifications from third parties relating to our quality systems and standards.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods, which can affect both our operations as well as the opportunities in the markets we serve due to the effects on our customers and their end users.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services, and our failure to comply with regulations and certifications could seriously affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our medical sector business is subject to substantial government regulation, primarily from the federal Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and similar regulatory bodies in other countries.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We must comply with statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Failure to comply with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of devices, or total or partial suspension of production.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	The FDA also has the authority to require repair or replacement of equipment, or the refund of the cost of a device manufactured or distributed by our customers.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Violations may lead to penalties or shutdowns of a program or a facility.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Failure or noncompliance could have an adverse effect on our reputation as well as our results of operations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P28_S6	In addition, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, as well as the financial health of health care providers, and pending changes in how health care in the U.S. is structured and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in the medical sector.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We also design and manufacture products for customers in the defense and aerospace industries.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Companies that design and manufacture products for these industries face significant regulation by the Department of Defense, Department of State, Federal Aviation Authority, and other governmental agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Failure to comply with related requirements and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation, could result in fines, penalties, injunctions, criminal prosecution, and an inability to participate in contracts with the government or their contractors, any of which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The end markets for most of our customers in the wireline/networking and wireless infrastructure sectors are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission, as well as by various governmental agencies.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The policies of these agencies can directly affect both the near-term and long-term demand and profitability of the sector and therefore directly impact the demand for products that we manufacture.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	At the corporate level, as a publicly-held company, we are subject to increasingly stringent laws, regulation and other requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, affecting, among other areas, our accounting, corporate governance practices and securities disclosures.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our failure to comply with these requirements could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly aggressive in enforcing and adopting anti-corruption laws.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, among others, apply to us and our operations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These requirements result in compliance costs, and the failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial further costs to us as well as affect our reputation.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The growth and changing requirements of our business are imposing a heightened level of activity involving import and export compliance requirements on us.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We were notified in April 2009 by U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) of its intention to conduct a customary Focused Assessment of our import activities during fiscal 2008 and of our processes and procedures to comply with U.S. Customs laws and regulations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	During September 2010 the Company reported errors relating to import trade activity from July 2004 to the date of Plexus report.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	CBP has indicated that on-site fieldwork for the audit was completed as of June 2011 and the Company is currently awaiting final determination of CBP duties and fees.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Plexus has agreed that it will implement improved processes and procedures and review these corrective measures with CBP.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We recorded an accrual in other current accrued liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 when the amount became estimable and probable, which was not material to the financial statements.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	At this time, we do not believe that any deficiencies in processes or controls or unanticipated costs, unpaid duties or penalties associated with this matter will have a material adverse effect on Plexus or the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental regulations pertaining to air, water, and hazardous waste and the health and safety of our workplace.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If we fail to comply with present and future regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or the suspension of business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	These regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur significant expense associated with the ongoing operation of our business or remediation efforts.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Our customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements, and certification requirements, including many of the industry-specific regulations discussed above.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Our customers failure to comply could affect their businesses, which in turn would affect our sales to them.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P36_S5	In addition, if our customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs for these customers and create inefficiencies in our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P36_S6	If we are unable to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise, our results may be adversely affected.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P36_S7	The markets for our manufacturing, engineering and other services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process developments.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P36_S8	Our internal processes are also subject to these factors.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P36_S9	The continued success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to:
785786_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	required by our customers in the future.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, we may have to acquire new design, assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S3	The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S5	An inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, may adversely affect our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S6	As a global company with a complex business model, we heavily depend on our information systems to support our customers requirements and to successfully manage our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S7	Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to system security, reliability, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S8	In addition, our failure to maintain adequate data security for both our and our customers financial, product and other information, could substantially affect our business, compliance with regulations and reputation in the industry.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S9	Start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S10	The management of labor and production capacity in connection with the establishment of new or recent programs and customer relationships, such as our arrangements with The Coca-Cola Company, and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross and operating margins.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P38_S11	These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life-cycle of new products and programs, which lack a track record of order volume and timing, as well as in program transfers between facilities.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are managing a number of new programs at any given time.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Consequently, we are exposed to these factors.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In addition, if any of these programs or customer relationships were terminated, our operating results could worsen, particularly in the short term.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We conduct these transfers on a regular basis to address factors such as meeting customer needs, seeking long-term efficiencies or responding to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Although we try to minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between Plexus facilities, there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P39_S6	There may be problems with the products we design or manufacture that could result in liability claims against us and reduced demand for our services.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The products that we design and/or manufacture may be subject to liability or claims in the event that defects are discovered or alleged.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We design and manufacture products to our customers specifications, many of which are highly complex.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the design and/or manufacturing of these products.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Problems in the products we manufacture, whether real or alleged, whether caused by faulty customer specifications or in the design or manufacturing processes or by a component defect, and whether or not we are responsible, may result in delayed shipments to customers and/or reduced or cancelled customer orders.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S5	These potential claims may include damages for the recall of a product and/or injury to person or property.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Even if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S7	While we seek to insure against many of these risks, insurance coverage may be either inadequate or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S8	We occasionally incur costs defending claims, and any such disputes could affect our business relationships.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S9	Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S10	Our design and manufacturing services and the products offered by our customers involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S11	In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P41_S12	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Infringement by our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and disrupt our production.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Additionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products, and could affect our customer relationships more broadly.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and components upon which we rely.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Our products are for end markets that require technologically advanced products with relatively short life-cycles.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Factors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve, in particular short product life-cycles, could seriously affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Even if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business relationships with them and our production for them, can affect our production cycles, inventory management and results of operations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Increased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The EMS industry is highly competitive and has become more so as a result of excess capacity in the industry.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We compete against numerous EMS providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally and may choose to manufacture products themselves rather than outsource that process.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Consolidations and other changes in the EMS industry result in a changing competitive landscape.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial, manufacturing, engineering, technical, financial, systems, sales and marketing resources than ourselves.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	be better positioned to compete on price for their services.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We may operate at a cost disadvantage compared to other EMS providers that have lower internal cost structures or greater direct buying power with component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or become increasingly competitive.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or loss of market share.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P46_S4	We depend on our workforce, including certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel or other personnel disruptions may harm our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Our success depends in large part on the continued services of our key technical and management personnel, and on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, particularly highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of products.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P46_S6	The competition for these individuals is significant, and the loss of key employees could harm our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P46_S7	From time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, disability, death and other terminations of service that affect our executive officers and other key employees.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P46_S8	Transitions of responsibilities among officers and key employees, particularly those that are unplanned, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, which could have an effect on our results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We also depend on good relationships with our workforce generally.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Any disruption in our relationships with our personnel, including as a result of potential union organizing activities, work actions or other labor issues, could substantially affect our operations and results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, when we expand operations in either existing areas or new locations, we need to retain the services of sufficient qualified personnel to conduct those operations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	If we fail to retain and maintain sufficient qualified personnel, the operations at those locations, and consequently our financial results, could be adversely affected.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S4	In new or existing facilities we may be subject to local labor practices or union activities, differing employment laws and regulations in various countries, and other issues affecting our workforce, all of which could affect operations at particular locations, which also could have adverse effects on our operational results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Natural disasters and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis and floods.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S7	All facilities are subject to other natural or man-made disasters such as those related to global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism, breaches of security and failures of utilities.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S8	If such an event was to occur, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event; potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S9	In addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S10	If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S11	Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and thus negatively affect our relationships and financial results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S12	We have increased our borrowings, and we may fail to secure or maintain necessary financing.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S13	Under our credit agreement (the Credit Facility ) and Note Purchase Agreement , over the past several years we have borrowed $325 million in term loans and notes, of which $273 million was outstanding at October 1, 2011, and can borrow up to $200 million in revolving loans, of which $100 million is currently available, depending upon compliance with its defined covenants and conditions.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S14	The Credit Facility may be increased by an additional $100 million to a total of $200 million if we have not previously terminated all or any portion of the Credit Facility, there is no event of default existing under the Credit Facility and both we and the administrative agent consent to the increase.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S15	However, we cannot be certain that the credit facilities will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary or appropriate in the future, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S16	In addition, as a consequence of the turmoil in the global financial markets and banking systems, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit agreement and our interest rate swap agreements, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S17	Our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S18	For example, in fiscal 2011 we issued $175 million in principal amount of 5.20% senior notes, due in 2018, to support our share repurchase program.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S19	We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining new credit facilities or a combination of these methods.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S20	We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S21	If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders ownership interests.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S22	Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S23	We may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions and may not successfully integrate acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S24	We have previously grown, in part, through acquisitions.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P47_S25	If we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions, this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	the loss of key employees of acquired businesses.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	the unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a reduction in the value of our common stock.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K; that report must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a company s financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are continuing our comprehensive efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, this could lead to a failure to meet our reporting obligations to the SEC, which in turn could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Our stock price has fluctuated significantly in recent periods.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P51_S4	The price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors relating to us, our competitors and the market for our services, many of which are beyond our control.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P51_S5	In addition, the stock market in general, and share prices for technology companies in particular, have from time to time experienced extreme volatility, including weakness, that sometimes has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P51_S6	These broad market and industry fluctuations, and concerns affecting the economy generally, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating results.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P51_S7	Among other things, volatility and weakness in our stock price could mean that investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices that they paid.
785786_11_ITEM1A_P51_S8	Volatility and weakness could also impair our ability in the future to offer common stock or convertible securities as a source of additional capital and/or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses.
785786_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	facilities comprise an integrated network of engineering and manufacturing centers with our corporate headquarters located in Neenah, Wisconsin.
785786_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own or lease facilities with approximately 2.8 million square feet of capacity.
785786_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	This includes approximately 1.8 million square feet in the Americas region ( AMER ), approximately 0.9 million square feet in the Asia-Pacific region ( APAC ) and approximately 0.1 million square feet in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region ( EMEA ).
785786_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	Approximately 0.2 million square feet of this capacity is subleased.
785786_11_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our facilities as of October 1, 2011, are described in the following table:
785786_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) Includes more than one building.
785786_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	(4) This building is subleased and no longer used in our operations.
785786_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	In fiscal 2011, we purchased land in Xiamen, China and began construction of an additional manufacturing facility, which is expected to be complete during the second half of fiscal 2012.
785786_11_ITEM2_P3_S1	The Company began construction of an additional manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia during early fiscal 2011 and anticipates completing the facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
785786_11_ITEM2_P3_S2	During the first half of fiscal 2012, we anticipate announcing the construction of a larger facility in Oradea, Romania to replace the leased buildings.
785786_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	were notified in April 2009 by U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) of its intention to conduct a customary Focused Assessment of our import activities during fiscal 2008 and of our processes and procedures to comply with U.S. Customs laws and regulations.
785786_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	During September 2010 the Company reported errors relating to import trade activity from July 2004 to the date of Plexus report.
785786_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	CBP has indicated that on-site fieldwork for the audit was completed as of June 2011 and the Company is currently awaiting final determination of CBP duties and fees.
785786_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	Plexus has agreed that it will implement improved processes and procedures and review these corrective measures with CBP.
785786_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	We recorded an accrual in other current accrued liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 when the amount became estimable and probable, which was not material to the financial statements.
785786_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	At this time, we do not believe that any deficiencies in processes or controls or unanticipated costs, unpaid duties or penalties associated with this matter will have a material adverse effect on Plexus or the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
785786_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	The Company is party to certain other lawsuits in the ordinary course of business.
785786_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	Management does not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

785786_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The price information below represents high and low sale prices of our common stock for each quarterly period.
785786_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total return on Plexus common stock with the Nasdaq Stock Market Index for U.S. Companies and the Nasdaq Stock Market Index for Electronic Components Companies, both of which include Plexus.
785786_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	The values on the graph show the relative performance of an investment of $100 made on September 29, 2006, in Plexus common stock and in each of the indices as of the last business day of the respective fiscal year.
785786_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	Shareholders of Record; Dividends As of November 11, 2011, there were approximately 630 shareholders of record.
785786_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	We have not paid any cash dividends.
785786_11_ITEM5_P2_S2	We currently anticipate that the majority of earnings in the foreseeable future will be retained to finance the development of our business.
785786_11_ITEM5_P2_S3	However, the Company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	OVERVIEW Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together Plexus, the Company, or we ) participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ( EMS ) industry.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	We deliver optimized Product Realization solutions through a unique Product Realization Value Stream services model.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	This customer focused services model seamlessly integrates innovative product conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and sustaining services to deliver comprehensive end-to-end solutions for customers in the Americas, European and Asia-Pacific regions.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	Customer service is provided to over 130 branded product companies in the Wireline/Networking, Wireless Infrastructure, Medical, Industrial/Commercial and Defense/Security/Aerospace market sectors.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S4	Our customers products typically require exceptional production and supply-chain flexibility, necessitating an optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solution across an integrated global platform.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S5	Many of our customers products require complex configuration management and direct order fulfillment to their customers across the globe.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S6	In such cases we provide global logistics management and after-market service and repair.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S7	Our customers products may have stringent requirements for quality, reliability and regulatory compliance.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S8	We offer our customers the ability to outsource all phases of product realization, including product specifications; development, design and design verification; regulatory compliance support; prototyping and new product introduction; manufacturing test equipment development; materials sourcing, procurement and supply-chain management; product assembly/manufacturing, configuration and test; order fulfillment, logistics and service/repair.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S9	We provide most of our contract manufacturing services on a turnkey basis, which means that we procure some or all of the materials required for product assembly.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S10	We provide some services on a consignment basis, which means that the customer supplies the necessary materials, and we provide the labor and other services required for product assembly.
785786_11_ITEM7_P0_S11	Turnkey services require material procurement and warehousing, in addition to manufacturing, and involve greater resource investments than consignment services.
785786_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Other than certain test equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
785786_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	In response to the evolving markets and to better reflect our customers end markets, we have decided to combine our Wireline/Networking and Wireless Infrastructure market sectors and rename them as our Networking/Communications market sector, beginning with our fiscal 2012 reporting.
785786_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	The following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A herein.
785786_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased by $217.8 million, or 10.8 percent, from fiscal year 2010 to $2,231.2 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	Net sales increased in all of our market sectors during fiscal 2011, except for a decrease in the wireless infrastructure sector.
785786_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	The overall higher net sales were from both new and existing customers, such as the ramp of production for our newer industrial commercial sector customer, as well as an increase in net sales to Juniper Networks, Inc. ( Juniper ), our largest customer, as a result of improved end-market demand for the mix of Juniper products we produce as well as new product launches.
785786_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	We also experienced strong demand from a medical customer and a defense/security/aerospace customer during the year as a result of increased end market demand for the products they produce.
785786_11_ITEM7_P3_S4	These increases were partially offset by decreased net sales to two significant customers, one in the wireline/networking sector and one in the wireless infrastructure sector, related to previously announced disengagements as a result of acquisitions, and decreased sales from one additional wireless infrastructure customer as a result of a drop in end-market demand for the mix of its products that we produce.
785786_11_ITEM7_P3_S5	Gross margin was 9.6 percent for fiscal 2011, which compared unfavorably to 10.3 percent for fiscal 2010.
785786_11_ITEM7_P3_S6	Gross margins in fiscal 2011 were lower as a result changes in our customer mix, higher fixed expenses related to higher headcount to support the revenue growth and increased depreciation expense.
785786_11_ITEM7_P3_S7	The prior year also included proceeds from a litigation settlement (see Note 12).
785786_11_ITEM7_P3_S8	Selling and administrative expenses were $113.6 million for fiscal 2011, an increase of $6.3 million, or 5.9 percent, from the $107.3 million for fiscal 2010.
785786_11_ITEM7_P3_S9	The majority of the increase was due to higher employee compensation and relocation expense as a result of higher headcount to support revenue growth as well as higher stock based compensation expense.
785786_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Selling and administrative expenses were 5.1 percent of sales for fiscal 2011, as compared to 5.3 percent in fiscal 2010.
785786_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Other expense for fiscal 2011 decreased slightly from 2010, driven primarily by the favorable fluctuation in foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased interest expense.
785786_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	Net income for fiscal 2011 was $89.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.30, which compared to net income of $89.5 million, or $2.19 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010.
785786_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	Net income decreased slightly from the prior year period due to changes in customer mix and higher fixed and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased sales.
785786_11_ITEM7_P4_S4	Diluted earnings per share increased from the prior year period due to lower average shares outstanding related to our share repurchase program.
785786_11_ITEM7_P4_S5	The effective tax rate in the current year period was approximately 3 percent, which compares unfavorably to the 1 percent tax rate in the prior year period primarily due to the mix of the Company s fiscal 2011 pre-tax income.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2010 increased by $396.8 million, or 24.5 percent, from fiscal year 2009 to $2,013.4 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Net sales increased in all of our market sectors during fiscal 2010, except for a slight decrease in the defense/security/aerospace sector.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	The overall higher net sales were driven primarily by stronger end-market conditions, as well as the ramp of production for new customer programs in the wireless infrastructure, wireline/networking, industrial/commercial, and medical sectors.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	These increases were partially offset by decreased net sales from two defense/security/aerospace sector customers, as well as decreased net sales to Juniper.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S4	Net sales to Juniper declined slightly as a result of decreased end-market demand for the mix of Juniper products produced by us.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S5	Gross margin was 10.3 percent for fiscal 2010, which compared favorably to 9.6 percent for fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S6	Gross margins in fiscal 2010 were higher due to the increased net sales, changes in customer mix and proceeds from a litigation settlement (see Note 12), partially offset by increases in variable incentive compensation expense due to strong financial performance as well as fixed expenses as a result of higher headcount.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S7	Selling and administrative expenses were $107.3 million for fiscal 2010, an increase of $14.2 million, or 15.3 percent, from the $93.1 million for fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S8	Sixty percent of the increase was due to higher variable incentive compensation in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S9	The remainder of the increase was driven primarily by increased employee compensation expense as a result of higher headcount to support revenue growth.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S10	For fiscal 2010, the Company did not incur any restructuring or impairment charges as compared to charges of $8.6 million in fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S11	Net income for fiscal 2010 was $89.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.19, which compared favorably to net income of $46.3 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, for fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S12	Net income increased from fiscal 2009 due to overall increased sales and higher gross margins and the absence of restructuring charges, offset by increased fixed expenses and selling and administrative expenses.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S13	The effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was 1 percent, which compares unfavorably to the 2 percent tax benefit in fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S14	The increase in effective tax rate from fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the mix of the Company s fiscal 2010 pre-tax income and the absence in 2010 of a net $1.4 million tax benefit resulting from a discrete event that occurred in fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S15	The effective income tax rates (benefits) for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 3 percent, 1 percent and (2) percent, respectively.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S16	The increase in effective tax rate from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the mix of the Company s fiscal 2010 pre-tax income and the absence in 2010 of a net $1.4 million tax benefit resulting from a discrete event that occurred in fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P5_S17	The change in our effective tax rate from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 is primarily due to changes in the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
785786_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	One of our metrics for measuring financial performance is after-tax ROIC.
785786_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	We define after-tax ROIC as tax-effected operating income, excluding unusual charges, divided by average capital employed over a rolling five quarter period.
785786_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	Capital employed is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
785786_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	ROIC was 15.6 percent, 19.5 percent and 13.2 percent for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
785786_11_ITEM7_P6_S4	See the table below for our calculation of ROIC (dollars in millions):
785786_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure which should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of the Company s financial performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
785786_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance.
785786_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	In particular, we provide ROIC because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions as well as management s performance under the tests which it sets for itself.
785786_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	For a reconciliation of ROIC to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
785786_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	Net sales for the indicated periods were as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $217.8 million, or 10.8 percent, as compared to fiscal 2010.
785786_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The net sales increase resulted from higher net sales in all of our market sectors, except for a decrease in the wireless infrastructure sector.
785786_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	The net sales increase primarily related to the ramp of production for a newer industrial commercial sector customer.
785786_11_ITEM7_P8_S3	Net sales to Juniper increased as a result of improved end-market demand for the mix of Juniper products we produce as well as new product launches.
785786_11_ITEM7_P8_S4	Overall, we had net sales increases spread across new and existing customers in both the industrial commercial and medical sectors during fiscal 2011, which were partially offset by the two previously announced disengagements as a result of acquisitions (with one each in the wireline/networking and the wireless infrastructure market sectors), as well as decreased sales from one additional wireless infrastructure customer as a result of a drop in end-market demand for the mix of its products that we produce.
785786_11_ITEM7_P8_S5	Net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $396.8 million, or 24.5 percent, as compared to fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P8_S6	The net sales increase resulted from higher net sales in all of our market sectors, except for the defense/security/aerospace sector.
785786_11_ITEM7_P8_S7	The overall higher net sales were driven primarily by strong end-market conditions, as well as the addition of new customers in the wireless infrastructure, wireline/networking, industrial/commercial and medical sectors.
785786_11_ITEM7_P8_S8	These net sales increases were offset in part by decreased net sales to two defense/security/aerospace customers, as well as lower net sales to Juniper as a result of a decline in end-market demand for the mix of Juniper products produced by us.
785786_11_ITEM7_P8_S9	Our net sales percentages by market sector for the indicated periods were as follows:
785786_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	The percentages of net sales to customers representing 10 percent or more of net sales and net sales to our ten largest customers for the indicated periods were as follows:
785786_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays, modifications and transitions.
785786_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	We remain dependent on continued net sales to our significant customers, and our customer concentration with our top 10 customers remained at or above 53 percent during the year.
785786_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers.
785786_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Customers forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions.
785786_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations.
785786_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	In addition, as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector.
785786_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	In the current economic environment, we are seeing increased merger and acquisition activity that has impacted our customers.
785786_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	Specifically, we previously announced that two of our customers were acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
785786_11_ITEM7_P11_S5	The customer in the Wireline/Networking sector began to reduce orders to us at the end of fiscal 2010 and substantially disengaged in fiscal 2011.
785786_11_ITEM7_P11_S6	The customer in the Wireless Infrastructure sector began disengagement in fiscal 2011 and also substantially disengaged in fiscal 2011.
785786_11_ITEM7_P11_S7	Gross profit and gross margin for the indicated periods were as follows (dollars in millions): For fiscal 2011, gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors:
785786_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	partially offset by an increase in fixed manufacturing costs due to increased headcount expenses to support revenue growth of approximately $15.5 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	the effect of the non-recurrence of a $3.2 million benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 from a litigation settlement.
785786_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	For fiscal 2010, gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors:
785786_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	partially offset by increased variable compensation expense of approximately $6.6 million as a result of improved financial performance and fixed expenses, primarily in the AMER and APAC reportable segments, due to increased headcount to support the revenue growth.
785786_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Design work performed by the Company is not the proprietary property of Plexus and substantially all costs incurred with this work are considered reimbursable by our customers.
785786_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	We do not track research and development costs that are not reimbursed by our customers and we consider these amounts immaterial.
785786_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	Selling and administrative ( S A ) expenses for the indicated periods were as follows (dollars in millions): For fiscal 2011, the increase in S A expenses was due to increased employee compensation and relocation expense of approximately $8.1 million as a result of higher headcount to support revenue growth, as well as higher stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.1 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P15_S4	This was partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 of approximately $4.1 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P15_S5	A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased during fiscal 2011 as a result of net sales expanding more quickly than these cost increases.
785786_11_ITEM7_P15_S6	For fiscal 2010, sixty percent of the increase in S A expenses was due to higher variable incentive compensation expense as a result of strong financial performance.
785786_11_ITEM7_P15_S7	The remainder of the increase was driven primarily by an increase in headcount to support our revenue growth.
785786_11_ITEM7_P15_S8	A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased during fiscal 2010 as a result of net sales expanding more quickly than these cost increases.
785786_11_ITEM7_P15_S9	For both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, we did not incur any restructuring or asset impairment charges.
785786_11_ITEM7_P15_S10	Our restructuring and asset impairment costs for fiscal 2009 were as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	The restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal 2009 were associated with various reportable segments.
785786_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Management excludes such charges when analyzing the performance of the reportable segments.
785786_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	See Note 13 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for certain financial information regarding our reportable segments, including a summary of restructuring and asset impairment charges by reportable segment.
785786_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Other income (expense) for the indicated periods were as follows (dollars in millions): Other income (expense) for fiscal 2011 decreased $0.1 million, to $9.1 million of expense from $9.2 million of expense in fiscal 2010.
785786_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	This change was driven by the favorable fluctuation in foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments of $2.4 million, partially offset by increased interest expense of $2.1 million, primarily related to our private placement debt, which we entered into during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources below.
785786_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	Other income (expense) for fiscal 2010 increased $1.5 million, to $9.2 million of expense from $7.7 million of expense in fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	This change was driven by the unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments of $2.1 million and reduced interest income of $0.9 million due to lower effective interest rates, partially offset by decreased interest expense of $1.3 million, primarily related to servicing the $150 million term loan drawn in April 2008.
785786_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Income taxes for the indicated periods were as follows (dollars in millions): The change in our effective tax rate from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2011 is primarily due to change in mix in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
785786_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	As a result of using the with-and-without method under the requirements for accounting for stock-based compensation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance for federal and state taxes against the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to tax deductions in excess of compensation expense for stock options until such time as the related deductions actually reduce income taxes payable.
785786_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	As of the end of fiscal 2010 there was a valuation allowance of $1.0 million for federal and state taxes against the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to tax deductions in excess of compensation expense for stock options.
785786_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	During fiscal 2011 the Company recorded an additional valuation allowance $1.3 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	As a result, we had a remaining valuation allowance of approximately $2.3 million related to tax deductions associated with stock-based compensation as of October 1, 2011.
785786_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	During the preparation of the Company s fiscal 2011 consolidated financial statements, the Company performed an analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, regarding the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, consistent with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
785786_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company s U.S. operations generated losses during the fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011 years.
785786_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	While we believe these losses could be a significant factor in establishing such an allowance, we believe that based on the weight of all the evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to utilize its U.S. net deferred tax assets of approximately $21.7 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	See Note 6 Income Taxes for further details.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	In addition, there was a remaining valuation allowance of $1.6 million as of October 2, 2010, related to various state deferred income tax assets for which utilization was uncertain due to a lack of sustained profitability and limited carryforward periods in those states.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	There was no change in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2011.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	If the U.S. operations continue to generate losses, there may be a need to provide a valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets, which totaled $21.7 million as of October 1, 2011.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	During fiscal 2011 the Company added a valuation allowance of $0.3 million and $0.9 million in the United Kingdom and Romania, respectively, to offset the increase in net deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions which more likely than not will not be realized.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	We currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 8 to 10 percent.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S5	The rate increase is due mainly to the increase in projected income in the United States and lower projected income in low tax Malaysia and China jurisdictions.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S6	The Company has been granted tax holidays for its Malaysian and Xiamen, China subsidiaries.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S7	These tax holidays expire in 2024 and 2013, respectively, and are subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S8	In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, these subsidiaries generated income, which resulted in tax reductions of approximately $21.7 million ($0.57 per basic share), $23.0 million ($0.58 per basic share) and $15.2 million ($0.38 per basic share), respectively.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S9	As a result of the above factors, our net income decreased by $0.3 million, or (0.3) percent, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S10	Diluted earnings per share increased by 5.0 percent due to the effects of our fiscal 2011 stock repurchases.
785786_11_ITEM7_P22_S11	Net income increased by $43.2 million, or 93.3 percent, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009; diluted earnings per share increased 87.2 percent.
785786_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	REPORTABLE SEGMENTS In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we completed our migration to a regional reporting structure, and as a result, modified our reportable segments.
785786_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	See Note 1 Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies for further information.
785786_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	A further discussion of our fiscal 2011 and 2010 financial performance by reportable segment is presented below (dollars in millions): Americas (AMER) :
785786_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $60.2 million, or 4.8 percent, from fiscal 2010, which reflected the ramp of production for our newer industrial commercial sector customer.
785786_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	of improved end-market demand for the mix of Juniper products we produce in the region as well as new product launches.
785786_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	These increases were offset by reduced net sales to two significant wireless infrastructure customers, one as a result of a previously announced disengagement and the other as a result of a drop in end-market demand for the mix of products we produce for that customer.
785786_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	Operating income for fiscal 2011 decreased $5.7 million from fiscal 2010 due to the prior year period benefitting from a $3.2 million litigation settlement, as well as changes in customer mix in the current year.
785786_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	Net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $160.4 million, or 14.8 percent, from fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	This increase reflected higher end-market demand from numerous existing customers in each of our market sectors and the ramp of production for new customers in the wireline/networking, wireless infrastructure, industrial/commercial and medical sectors.
785786_11_ITEM7_P25_S5	These increases were partially offset by reduced net sales to our largest customer, Juniper, due to the transfer of manufacturing of some products to our APAC reportable segment, as well as decreased end-market demand for the mix of Juniper products produced by us.
785786_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Operating income for fiscal 2010 increased $13.2 million from fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of higher revenues from the customers noted above, improved operating efficiencies resulting from higher production levels and proceeds received from a litigation settlement.
785786_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Asia-Pacific (APAC): Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $137.7 million, or 14.9 percent, over fiscal 2010.
785786_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	This growth reflected higher net sales to multiple customers across our market sectors as well as increased demand from a new customer in the industrial/commercial sector.
785786_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales from the previously announced disengagement of one customer in the wireline/networking sector as well as a drop in end-market demand for the mix of products we produce for a wireless infrastructure customer.
785786_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	Operating income improved $3.3 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily as a result of the net sales growth, partially offset by changes in customer mix and higher fixed expenses.
785786_11_ITEM7_P27_S4	Net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $337.3 million, or 57.4 percent, over fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P27_S5	This growth reflected higher net sales to multiple customers across our market sectors, increased demand from a new customer in the industrial/commercial sector and the transfer of the manufacturing of some Juniper products to the APAC reportable segment from the AMER reportable segment, partially offset by the decrease in demand from Juniper described above.
785786_11_ITEM7_P27_S6	Operating income improved $51.1 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of the net sales growth and operating efficiencies resulting from higher production levels.
785786_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) : Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $19.7 million, or 27.2 percent, from fiscal 2010.
785786_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	The change in net sales was driven by higher demand from two existing customer programs as well as the ramp of production for two new customers.
785786_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	Operating results were lower in the current year as compared to the prior year due to increased operating costs from our Romania facility and our new engineering facility in Darmstadt, Germany.
785786_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	Net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $16.9 million, or 30.4 percent, from fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM7_P28_S4	The change in net sales can be attributed to higher demand from the ramp of production for two existing customer programs in the industrial/commercial sector.
785786_11_ITEM7_P28_S5	Operating results were lower in the current year as compared to the prior year due to operating costs from our new Romania facility.
785786_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	For our significant customers, we generally manufacture products in more than one location.
785786_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	For example, sales to Juniper occur in AMER and APAC.

785786_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flows provided by operating activities were $161.7 million for fiscal 2011, compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $2.0 million and $170.3 million for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.
785786_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	During fiscal 2011, the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily the result of improvements in working capital.

785786_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	As part of our continued efforts to mitigate inventory risk, we have collected approximately $29.8 million in cash deposits from our customers, which are classified as customer deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and have also continued to work with customers that have excess inventory issues in accordance with contractual obligations.
785786_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	The overall decrease in accounts receivable of $27.2 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was mainly due to two customers, one in each of the industrial/commercial and the wireline/networking sectors, prepaying their respective accounts in fiscal 2011.
785786_11_ITEM7_P31_S3	Our annualized days sales outstanding in accounts receivable for fiscal 2011 decreased favorably from 51 days in fiscal 2010 to 48 days in fiscal 2011.
785786_11_ITEM7_P31_S4	Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $71.9 million for fiscal 2011.

785786_11_ITEM7_P31_S11	We currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 to be approximately $90-95 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P31_S12	A significant portion of the fiscal 2012 capital expenditures is anticipated to be used for the completion of the two facilities mentioned above (Penang, Malaysia and Xiamen, China).
785786_11_ITEM7_P31_S13	We also anticipate announcing, during the first half of fiscal 2012, the construction of a larger facility in Oradea, Romania to replace leased buildings that served as our start-up solution in lower-cost Europe.
785786_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $37.0 million for fiscal 2011, primarily due to purchases of common stock related to our stock repurchase program as well as payments on our term note and capital leases, offset by proceeds from our private placement debt issuance and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

785786_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	The Company did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2010.
785786_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	To support our new share repurchase program, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the Agreement ) for $175 million in principal amount of 5.20% Senior Notes, due June 15, 2018 (the Notes ) during the third quarter of fiscal 2011.

785786_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Agreement includes operational and financial covenants which include a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio and restrictions on additional indebtedness, liens and dispositions, all as defined in the Agreement.
785786_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	We are currently in compliance with all such covenants.
785786_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Origination fees and expenses associated with the private placement totaled approximately $0.9 million and have been deferred.
785786_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	These origination fees and expenses are being amortized over the seven-year term of the Notes.
785786_11_ITEM7_P33_S4	Semi-annual interest payments began on June 15, 2011 and end on June 15, 2018 with full repayment of the total principal of the Notes.
785786_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we entered into two separate treasury rate lock hedge contracts to hedge the variability of the fixed interest rate on the then forecasted issuance of $175 million of fixed rate debt using a treasury lock transaction.
785786_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The fixed interest rates for each of these contracts are 2.77% and 2.72%, respectively, with a notional value of $150 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	On April 4, 2011, we entered into a final treasury rate lock hedge transaction for the remaining $25 million of exposure at a rate of 2.88%.
785786_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	On April 8, 2011, when the fixed interest rate for the debt issuance was determined, all three treasury rate lock contracts were settled and we received proceeds of $2.3 million, which is being amortized over the seven year term of the related debt.
785786_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	On April 4, 2008, we entered into our credit agreement (the Credit Facility ) with a group of banks which allows us to borrow $150 million in term loans and $100 million in revolving loans.
785786_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	The $150 million in term loans was immediately funded and the $100 million revolving credit facility is currently available.
785786_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	The Credit Facility is unsecured and may be increased by an additional $100 million to a total of $200 million (the accordion feature ).
785786_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	existing under the credit agreement and both we and the administrative agent consent to the increase.
785786_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	The Credit Facility expires on April 4, 2013.
785786_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be either through term loans or revolving or swing loans or letter of credit obligations.
785786_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	As of October 1, 2011, we had term loan borrowings of $97.5 million outstanding and no revolving borrowings under the Credit Facility.
785786_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, which include a maximum total leverage ratio, maximum value of fixed rentals and operating lease obligations, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth test, all as defined in the agreement.
785786_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	As of October 1, 2011, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.
785786_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	If we incur an event of default, as defined in the Credit Facility (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant), the group of banks has the right to terminate the Credit Facility and all other obligations, and demand immediate repayment of all outstanding sums (principal and accrued interest).
785786_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	The interest rate on the borrowing varies depending upon our then-current total leverage ratio; as of October 1, 2011, the Company could elect to pay interest at a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus 1.50%.
785786_11_ITEM7_P38_S4	Rates would increase upon negative changes in specified Company financial metrics and would decrease upon reduction in the current total leverage ratio to no less than LIBOR plus 1.00%.
785786_11_ITEM7_P38_S5	We are also required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused credit commitment based on our leverage ratio; the current fee is 0.375%.
785786_11_ITEM7_P38_S6	Unless the accordion feature is exercised, this fee applies only to the initial $100 million of availability (excluding the $150 million of term borrowings).
785786_11_ITEM7_P38_S7	Origination fees and expenses associated with the Credit Facility totaled approximately $1.3 million and have been deferred.
785786_11_ITEM7_P38_S8	These origination fees and expenses will be amortized over the five-year term of the Credit Facility.

785786_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Credit Facility allows for the future payment of cash dividends or the future repurchases of shares provided that no event of default (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases.
785786_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Additionally, the Company enters interest rate swaps and foreign currency derivatives to hedge against variable cash flows.
785786_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value.
785786_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability (a fair value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge), or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.
785786_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
785786_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualify as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability.
785786_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income , until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
785786_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in the Accumulated other comprehensive income accounts within shareholders equity.

785786_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	In February 2010, the Company negotiated the settlement of a capital lease in Kelso, Scotland.
785786_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	The termination of this capital lease obligation and acquisition of the property was effected through a cash payment by Plexus of $3.9 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows from operations, available cash and short-term investments, the Credit Facility, and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months.
785786_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	$100 million of committed credit is currently available under the Credit Facility, with another $100 million available in an accordion facility, which is contingent upon compliance with the Credit Agreement and lender approval.
785786_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing.
785786_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources.
785786_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	However, particularly due to the current instability of the credit and financial markets, we cannot be certain that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms.
785786_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	We have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not currently anticipate paying them in the future.
785786_11_ITEM7_P44_S5	However, the Company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS Our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings.
785786_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	Information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 1, 2011 (dollars in millions):
785786_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	1) As of April 4, 2008, we entered into the Credit Facility and immediately funded a term loan for $150 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	As of October 1, 2011, the outstanding balance was $97.5 million.
785786_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	The amounts listed above include interest, as we intend to hold the loan to maturity.
785786_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	See Note 4 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	2) As of April 21, 2011, we entered into the Note Purchase Agreement and immediately issued $100 million in principal amount and another $75 million in principal amount of notes on June 15, 2011.
785786_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	The amounts listed above include interest, as we intend to hold the notes to maturity.
785786_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	See Note 4 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	3) As of October 1, 2011, purchase obligations consist of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business.
785786_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	4) As of October 1, 2011, other long-term obligations on the balance sheet included deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers, as well as other key employees, and an asset retirement obligation.
785786_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	We have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately $7.4 million, as of October 1, 2011, related to unrecognized income tax benefits.
785786_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	The Company cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to this obligation.
785786_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	5) As of October 1, 2011, other long-term obligations not on the balance sheet consisted of a commitment for salary continuation in the event employment of one executive officer of the Company is terminated without cause.
785786_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	We did not have, and were not subject to, any lines of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations, other off-balance sheet arrangements or other commercial commitments that are material.
785786_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	During fiscal 2011, there were no material changes to these policies.
785786_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Our more critical accounting policies are noted below: Stock-Based Compensation The Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	We used the modified prospective application, under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning with the first period that we adopted the FASB regulation and continuing to be expensed thereafter.
785786_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We continue to use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value stock options.
785786_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	See Note 1 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
785786_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	Recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property, plant and equipment are expected to generate.
785786_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value.
785786_11_ITEM7_P54_S3	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_11_ITEM7_P54_S4	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings.
785786_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Intangible Assets During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.7 million, related to the Company s sole goodwill asset.
785786_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The impairment wrote off the entire carrying value of our goodwill related to our Kelso facility, which was the sole reporting unit in the EMEA reportable segment.
785786_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The impairment charge was driven by adverse macroeconomic conditions that contributed to an overall reduction in demand for the Company s offerings from the Kelso facility.
785786_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	These conditions led to an interim triggering event , leading management to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.
785786_11_ITEM7_P55_S4	This test resulted in the determination that the carrying value of the goodwill relating to Kelso was fully impaired and therefore an impairment charge of $5.7 million was taken.
785786_11_ITEM7_P55_S5	Should we have goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in the future, we would test those assets for impairment, at least annually, and recognize any related losses when incurred.
785786_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Revenue Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled.
785786_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with durations of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling, if applicable.
785786_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value.
785786_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability (a fair value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge), or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.
785786_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
785786_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualify as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability.
785786_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income , until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
785786_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in the Accumulated other comprehensive income accounts within shareholders equity.
785786_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	See Note 5 Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements for further details.
785786_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
785786_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
785786_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_11_ITEM7_P62_S3	Accordingly, the Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
785786_11_ITEM7_P62_S4	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. .
785786_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	If the U.S. operations continue to generate losses, there may be a need to provide a valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets, which totaled $21.7 million as of October 1, 2011.
785786_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
785786_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	In fiscal 2009, we recorded goodwill impairment charges related to our United Kingdom operations of $5.7 million.
785786_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	In addition, we recorded pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $2.8 million which related primarily to the reduction of workforce in the United States and Mexico as well as fixed assets written down related to the closure of our Ayer, Massachusetts ( Ayer ) facility.
785786_11_ITEM6_P0_S2	A favorable tax adjustment of approximately $1.4 million, primarily related to the conclusion of federal and state audits, was also recorded.
785786_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	In fiscal 2008, we recorded pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $2.1 million which related primarily to the closure of our Ayer facility and the reduction of our workforce in Juarez, Mexico ( Juarez ).
785786_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	In fiscal 2007, we recorded pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment costs totaling $1.8 million which related primarily to the closure of our Maldon, England ( Maldon ) facility and the reduction of our workforces in Juarez and Kelso, Scotland ( Kelso ).
785786_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	We have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not currently anticipate paying them in the future.
785786_11_ITEM6_P2_S2	However, the Company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Beginning in July 2009, we entered into forward contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated transactions in our APAC reportable segment and beginning in July 2011, we entered into forward contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated transactions in Mexico, as described in Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the indicated periods were as follows:
785786_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Based on the Company s overall currency exposure, as of October 1, 2011, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have financial instruments, including cash equivalents and short-term investments as well as debt, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We consider the use of interest-rate swaps and treasury rate locks based on existing market conditions.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We have entered into interest rate swaps for $97.5 million in term loans, as described in Note 5 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As is common with these types of agreements, our interest rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements are subject to the further risk that the counterparties to these agreements may fail to comply with their obligations thereunder.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	To achieve this, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of highly rated securities, money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Our only material interest rate risk as of October 1, 2011, is associated with our Credit Facility under which we borrowed $150 million.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P5_S3	Through the use of interest rate swaps, as described above, we have fixed the basis on which we pay interest, thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk.
785786_11_ITEM7A_P5_S4	A 10 percent change in the weighted average interest rate on our average long-term borrowings would have had only a nominal impact on interest expense.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures: The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have reviewed and evaluated, with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date ).
785786_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on such evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective (a) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, and (b) in assuring that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
785786_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management of the Company, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
785786_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on its assessment and those criteria, management of the Company has concluded that, as of October 1, 2011, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2011, as stated in their report included herein on page 41.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls: Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P2_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P2_S5	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P2_S6	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
785786_11_ITEM9A_P2_S7	Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have nonetheless reached the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Plexus Corp.:
785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries at October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 1, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S2	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S3	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S4	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S5	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S6	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S8	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S9	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S10	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
785786_11_ITEM15_P3_S11	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
785786_11_ITEM15_P4_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
785786_11_ITEM15_P4_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
785786_11_ITEM15_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
785786_11_ITEM15_P4_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

785786_11_ITEM15_P6_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

785786_11_ITEM15_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
785786_11_ITEM15_P9_S0	Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business: Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together Plexus, the Company, or we ) participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ( EMS ) industry.
785786_11_ITEM15_P9_S1	We deliver optimized Product Realization solutions through a unique Product Realization Value Stream services model.
785786_11_ITEM15_P9_S2	This customer focused services model seamlessly integrates innovative product conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and sustaining services to deliver comprehensive end-to-end solutions for customers in the Americas, European, and Asia-Pacific regions.
785786_11_ITEM15_P9_S3	Customer service is provided to over 130 branded product companies in the Wireline/Networking, Wireless Infrastructure, Medical, Industrial/Commercial and Defense/Security/Aerospace market sectors.
785786_11_ITEM15_P9_S4	Our customers products typically require exceptional production and supply-chain flexibility, necessitating an optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solution across an integrated global platform.
785786_11_ITEM15_P9_S5	Many of our customers products require complex configuration management and direct order fulfillment to their customers across the globe.
785786_11_ITEM15_P9_S6	In such cases we provide global logistics management and after-market service and repair.
785786_11_ITEM15_P9_S7	Our customers products may have stringent requirements for quality, reliability and regulatory compliance.
785786_11_ITEM15_P9_S8	We offer our customers the ability to outsource all phases of product realization, including product specifications; development, design and design verification; regulatory compliance support; prototyping and new product introduction; manufacturing test equipment development; materials sourcing, procurement and supply-chain management; product assembly/manufacturing, configuration and test; order fulfillment, logistics and service/repair.
785786_11_ITEM15_P9_S9	Consolidation Principles and Basis of Presentation:
785786_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries.
785786_11_ITEM15_P10_S1	All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
785786_11_ITEM15_P10_S2	The Company s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
785786_11_ITEM15_P10_S3	The Company also uses a 4-4-5 weekly accounting system for the interim periods in each quarter.
785786_11_ITEM15_P10_S4	Each quarter, therefore, ends on a Saturday at the end of the 4-4-5 period.
785786_11_ITEM15_P10_S5	Periodically, an additional week must be added to the fiscal year to re-align with the Saturday closest to September 30.
785786_11_ITEM15_P10_S6	Fiscal 2009 included this additional week and the fiscal year ended on October 3, 2009.
785786_11_ITEM15_P10_S7	Therefore fiscal 2009 included 371 days.
785786_11_ITEM15_P10_S8	The additional week was added to the first fiscal quarter, ended January 3, 2009, which included 98 days.
785786_11_ITEM15_P10_S9	The accounting years for fiscal 2011 and 2010 each included 364 days.
785786_11_ITEM15_P11_S0	In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, as previously announced, we completed our migration to a regional reporting structure.
785786_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	This change included establishing regional targets for various financial metrics, delegating additional authority to the regions to manage their business, and changing our related internal reporting.
785786_11_ITEM15_P11_S2	Given this change to regional reporting and management, as well as in the information used by management for assessing performance and allocating Company resources, we modified our reporting segments.
785786_11_ITEM15_P11_S3	Prior to fiscal 2011, the Company s reportable segments consisted of the United States, Asia, Europe and Mexico.
785786_11_ITEM15_P11_S4	During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we combined our United States and Mexico segments into the Americas ( AMER ) segment and renamed our Asia segment Asia-Pacific ( APAC ) and our Europe segment Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) to better represent our long-range regional focus.
785786_11_ITEM15_P11_S5	As a result, we have conformed all prior period segment presentations to be consistent with our current reportable segments.
785786_11_ITEM15_P11_S6	See Note 13 - Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers for further information.
785786_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	Plexus Corp. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months.
785786_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
785786_11_ITEM15_P13_S1	Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
785786_11_ITEM15_P13_S2	Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment.
785786_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond the Company s control.
785786_11_ITEM15_P14_S1	Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory.
785786_11_ITEM15_P14_S2	Any actions taken by the Company s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.
785786_11_ITEM15_P14_S3	Per contractual terms, customer deposits are received by the Company to offset obsolete and excess inventory risks.
785786_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation: These assets are stated at cost.
785786_11_ITEM15_P15_S1	Depreciation, determined on the straight-line method, is based on lives assigned to the major classes of depreciable assets as follows:
785786_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	Certain facilities and equipment held under capital leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the lease terms and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities.
785786_11_ITEM15_P16_S1	Lease amortization is included in depreciation expense (see Note 3) and the financing component of the lease payments is classified as interest expense.
785786_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	For the capitalization of software costs, the Company capitalizes significant costs incurred in the acquisition or development of software for internal use, including the costs of the software, consultants as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees directly involved in developing internal use computer software once the final selection of the software is made.
785786_11_ITEM15_P17_S1	Costs incurred prior to the final selection of software and costs not qualifying for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
785786_11_ITEM15_P17_S2	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
785786_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets : During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.7 million, writing off the entire carrying value of its goodwill related to its Kelso, Scotland ( Kelso ) facility.
785786_11_ITEM15_P18_S1	The impairment charge was driven by macroeconomic conditions that contributed to an overall reduction in demand for the Company s offerings from the Kelso facility.
785786_11_ITEM15_P18_S2	These conditions led to an interim triggering event, leading management to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.
785786_11_ITEM15_P18_S3	This test resulted in the determination that the carrying value of the goodwill relating to Kelso, the Company s sole remaining goodwill asset, was fully impaired and therefore an impairment charge of $5.7 million was recorded.
785786_11_ITEM15_P18_S4	Should the Company have goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in the future, the Company would test those assets for impairment at least annually, and recognize any related losses when incurred.
785786_11_ITEM15_P18_S5	Recoverability of goodwill would be measured at the reporting unit level.
785786_11_ITEM15_P18_S6	The Company would measure the recoverability of goodwill under the annual impairment test by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the reporting unit s estimated fair market value, which would be primarily estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows, although market valuations may also be employed.
785786_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
785786_11_ITEM15_P19_S1	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill include, but are not limited to, the loss of a significant customer or customers and unforeseen reductions in customer demand, future operating performance or industry demand.
785786_11_ITEM15_P19_S2	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable through estimated future undiscounted cash flows.
785786_11_ITEM15_P19_S3	If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a charge against current operations.
785786_11_ITEM15_P19_S4	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_11_ITEM15_P19_S5	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.
785786_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.
785786_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as program costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_11_ITEM15_P22_S2	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_11_ITEM15_P22_S3	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	Net sales from engineering design and development services were less than five percent of total sales in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009.
785786_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured products based on management s analysis of historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling.
785786_11_ITEM15_P24_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are provided for the difference between the financial statement balance of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
785786_11_ITEM15_P25_S1	The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized (see Note 6).
785786_11_ITEM15_P25_S2	Realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the Company s ability to generate future taxable income.
785786_11_ITEM15_P25_S3	Recognition of deferred income tax assets is evaluated and tax reserves are recorded to address potential exposures related to income tax positions taken by the Company.
785786_11_ITEM15_P25_S4	These reserves are based on the assumptions and past experiences of the Company and provide for the uncertainty surrounding the application of statutes, rules, regulations, and interpretations to its income tax filings.
785786_11_ITEM15_P25_S5	It is possible that the actual costs or benefits relating to these matters may be materially more or less than the amount the Company estimated.
785786_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	Foreign Currency Translation: We translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at year-end.
785786_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	We translate net sales, expenses and cash flows at the average monthly exchange rates during the respective periods.
785786_11_ITEM15_P26_S2	Adjustments resulting from translation of the financial statements are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income .
785786_11_ITEM15_P26_S3	Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved and remeasurement adjustments for foreign operations where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency are included in our Statements of Operations as a component of miscellaneous income (expense).
785786_11_ITEM15_P26_S4	Exchange gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions were $1.0 million, $(1.5) million, and $0.7 million for the fiscal years ended October 1, 2011, October 2, 2010, and October 3, 2009, respectively.
785786_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	Derivatives: The Company periodically enters into derivative contracts such as foreign currency forwards and interest rate swaps, which are designated as cash flow hedges.
785786_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value.
785786_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability (a fair value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge), or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.
785786_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
785786_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
785786_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
785786_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.
785786_11_ITEM15_P40_S1	The input levels are: Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
785786_11_ITEM15_P40_S2	Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
785786_11_ITEM15_P40_S3	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.

785786_11_ITEM15_P46_S6	In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, which establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, replaces the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price, eliminates the residual method of allocation by requiring that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method and requires that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a stand-alone basis.
785786_11_ITEM15_P46_S7	This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2010.

785786_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	Income tax expense (benefit) for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 consisted of (in thousands):
785786_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rates reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009:
785786_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company recorded income tax expense of $2.8 million and $0.9 million for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.
785786_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	The Company recorded income tax benefit of $(0.9) million for fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM15_P71_S3	The increase to the income tax expense recorded in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 is primarily due to the change in the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
785786_11_ITEM15_P71_S4	The difference in our effective income tax rate as compared to our normal statutory rate is primarily due to the effect of pre-tax income in Malaysia and Xiamen, China, where we benefit from reduced effective tax rates due to tax holidays.
785786_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	The components of the net deferred income tax asset as of October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010, consisted of (in thousands):
785786_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	During the preparation of the Company s fiscal 2011 consolidated financial statements, the Company performed an analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, regarding the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, consistent with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
785786_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Company s U.S. operations generated losses during the fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011 years.
785786_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	While we believe these losses could be a significant factor in establishing such an allowance, we believe that based on the weight of all the evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to utilize its U.S. net deferred tax assets of approximately $21.7 million.
785786_11_ITEM15_P74_S2	The positive evidence relied upon is as follows: 1) orders for a new large U.S. industrial/commercial customer are currently projected to significantly increase in fiscal 2012, which we believe would result in income for the Company s U.S. operations in fiscal 2012 and beyond; 2) the effect of the deep U.S. recession during this period was considered atypical; 3) the Company s U.S. operations created cumulative pretax income for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 of more than $150 million; 4) the federal tax losses in fiscal 2009 and 2010 were able to be fully utilized through loss carrybacks to prior years; and 5) the federal loss carryforward at the end of fiscal 2011 has a 20 year carryforward period.
785786_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	As a result of using the with-and-without method under the requirements for accounting for stock-based compensation, the Company recorded a valuation allowance for state taxes against the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to tax deductions in excess of compensation expense for stock options until such time as the related deductions actually reduce income taxes payable.
785786_11_ITEM15_P75_S1	The Company reversed approximately $0.1 million of this valuation allowance with corresponding credits to additional paid-in capital in fiscal 2009.
785786_11_ITEM15_P75_S2	As of the end of fiscal 2010 there was a valuation allowance of $1.0 million for federal and state taxes against the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to tax deductions in excess of compensation expense for stock options.

785786_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	approximately $2.3 million related to tax deductions associated with stock-based compensation as of October 1, 2011.
785786_11_ITEM15_P76_S1	In addition, there is a remaining valuation allowance of $1.6 million as of October 1, 2011, related to various state deferred income tax assets where it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized due to a lack of sustained profitability and limited carryforward periods in these states.
785786_11_ITEM15_P76_S2	During fiscal 2011 the Company added a valuation allowance of $0.3 million and $0.9 million in the United Kingdom and Romania, respectively to offset the increase in net deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions which, more likely than not, will not be realized.

785786_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	These laws did not have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009; however, they could have a material effect on future periods.

785786_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	This law did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009 and we do not currently believe that it will create a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods.
785786_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	In March 2007, the Chinese government made significant changes to its tax law with a bias toward a unified tax rate for domestic and foreign enterprises of 25 percent.

785786_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	The effect of the law on enterprises with agreed-upon incentives requires that their China federal taxes will be increased to the new unified tax rate over a five-year period that began in calendar 2008.
785786_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	This law did not have a material effect on our income taxes for our fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009 tax years.
785786_11_ITEM15_P81_S1	However, depending upon the relative amount of income earned in China in the future, the increased tax rates on our China income could have a material effect.

785786_11_ITEM15_P84_S3	The Company does not provide for taxes that would be payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted because the Company considers these earnings to be invested for an indefinite period.

785786_11_ITEM15_P84_S5	If such earnings were repatriated, additional tax expense may result, although the calculation of such additional taxes is not practicable at this time.

785786_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	The impairment charge was driven by macroeconomic conditions that contributed to an overall reduction in demand for the Company s offerings from the Kelso facility.
785786_11_ITEM15_P93_S2	These conditions led to an interim triggering event , leading management to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.

785786_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	We recorded an accrual in other current accrued liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 when the amount became estimable and probable, which was not material to the financial statements.
785786_11_ITEM15_P119_S1	At this time, we do not believe that any deficiencies in processes or controls or unanticipated costs, unpaid duties or penalties associated with this matter will have a material adverse effect on Plexus or the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

785786_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers Reportable segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or group, in assessing performance and allocating resources.
785786_11_ITEM15_P122_S1	In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we completed our migration to a regional reporting structure, and as a result, modified our reportable segments.
785786_11_ITEM15_P122_S2	See Note 1 Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies for further information.
785786_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	The Company uses an internal management reporting system, which provides important financial data to evaluate performance and allocate the Company s resources on a regional basis.
785786_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	Net sales for segments are attributed to the region in which the product is manufactured or service is performed.
785786_11_ITEM15_P124_S1	The services provided, manufacturing processes used, class of customers serviced and order fulfillment processes used are similar and generally interchangeable across the segments.
785786_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	A segment s performance is evaluated based upon its operating income (loss).
785786_11_ITEM15_P125_S1	A segment s operating income (loss) includes its net sales less cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses, but excludes corporate and other costs, interest expense, other income (loss), and income taxes.
785786_11_ITEM15_P125_S2	Corporate and other costs primarily represent corporate selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring and impairment costs, if any.
785786_11_ITEM15_P125_S3	These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments.
785786_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	Inter-segment transactions are generally recorded at amounts that approximate arm s length transactions.
785786_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	The accounting policies for the regions are the same as for the Company taken as a whole.
785786_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	Information about the Company s three reportable segments in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in thousands):
785786_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	The following enterprise-wide information is provided in accordance with the required segment disclosures.

785786_11_ITEM15_P129_S2	Restructuring and asset impairment charges are not allocated to reportable segments, as management excludes such charges when assessing the performance of the reportable segments, but rather includes such charges within the Corporate and other costs section of the above table of operating income (loss).
785786_11_ITEM15_P129_S3	In fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 the Company did not incur any restructuring or asset impairment charges.
785786_11_ITEM15_P129_S4	In fiscal 2009, the Company incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges, as described in Note 10.
785786_11_ITEM15_P129_S5	The following table presents restructuring and asset impairment charges by segment for the years indicated (in thousands):
785786_11_ITEM15_P130_S0	The percentages of net sales to customers representing 10 percent or more of total net sales for the indicated periods were as follows: For our significant customers, we generally manufacture products in more than one location.
785786_11_ITEM15_P130_S1	For example, net sales to Juniper, our largest customer, occur in the AMER and APAC reportable segments.
785786_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	The percentages of accounts receivable from customers representing 10 percent or more of total accounts receivable for the indicated periods were as follows:
785786_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	No other customers represented 10 percent or more of the Company s total net sales or total trade receivable balances as of October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010.
785786_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	The Company offers certain indemnifications under its customer manufacturing agreements.
785786_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company may from time to time be obligated to indemnify its customers or its customers customers against damages or liabilities arising out of the Company s negligence, misconduct, breach of contract, or infringement of third party intellectual property rights.
785786_11_ITEM15_P134_S1	Certain agreements have extended broader indemnification, and while most agreements have contractual limits, some do not.
785786_11_ITEM15_P134_S2	However, the Company generally does not provide for such indemnities and seeks indemnification from its customers for damages or liabilities arising out of the Company s adherence to customers specifications or designs or use of materials furnished, or directed to be used, by its customers.
785786_11_ITEM15_P134_S3	The Company does not believe its obligations under such indemnities are material.
785786_11_ITEM15_P134_S4	In the normal course of business, the Company also provides its customers a limited warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products manufactured by the Company.
785786_11_ITEM15_P134_S5	Such warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects in the Company s workmanship and meet mutually agreed-upon specifications for periods generally ranging from 12 months to 24 months.
785786_11_ITEM15_P134_S6	If a product fails to comply with the Company s limited warranty, the Company s obligation is generally limited to correcting, at its expense, any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product.
785786_11_ITEM15_P134_S7	The Company s warranty generally excludes defects resulting from faulty customer-supplied components, design defects or damage caused by any party or cause other than the Company.
785786_11_ITEM15_P134_S8	The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized and establishes additional reserves for specifically identified product issues.
785786_11_ITEM15_P134_S9	These costs primarily include labor and materials, as necessary, associated with repair or replacement and are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current accrued liabilities.
785786_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	The primary factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the value and the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims.
785786_11_ITEM15_P135_S1	As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
785786_11_ITEM15_P136_S0	Plexus Corp. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Below is a table summarizing the activity related to the Company s limited warranty liability for the fiscal years 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):

785786_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Overview Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together Plexus, the Company, or we ) participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ( EMS ) industry.

785786_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our customer-focused solutions model seamlessly integrates innovative product conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and sustaining solutions.
785786_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Plexus delivers comprehensive end-to-end solutions for customers in the Americas ( AMER ), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA ) and Asia-Pacific ( APAC ) regions.
785786_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	We provide award-winning customer service to more than 140 branded product companies in the Networking/Communications, Healthcare/Life Sciences (formerly known as Medical), Industrial/Commercial and Defense/Security/Aerospace market sectors.
785786_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	Beginning in fiscal 2013, we renamed our Medical market sector as the Healthcare/Life Sciences market sector.
785786_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	This change stems from our evolving strategy and enhanced capabilities within this market and reflects the industry's progression to holistic patient care.
785786_12_ITEM1_P2_S3	We believe Healthcare/Life Sciences more accurately defines this growing industry and aligns with our existing and targeted customer base.
785786_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our customers have stringent quality, reliability and regulatory requirements, mandating exceptional production and supply chain agility.
785786_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	Their products require complex configuration management, direct order fulfillment (to end customers) and global logistics management and sustaining solutions.
785786_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	To service the complexities our customers' products demand, we utilize our Product Realization Value Stream, addressing our customers' products from concept to end of life -- conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and sustaining solutions.
785786_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Plexus is passionate about striving to be the leading EMS company in the world at servicing mid-to-low volume, higher complexity customer programs, characterized by unique flexibility, technology, quality and regulatory requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	To support and deliver on our strategy, we align our operations, processes, workforce and financial metrics through a multidimensional business strategy that includes:
785786_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	We operate flexible manufacturing facilities and processes designed to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations.
785786_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	Each of our customers is supported by a multi-disciplinary customer team.
785786_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	One or more uniquely configured focus factories, supported by a supply chain and logistics solution, are designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness to support customer fulfillment requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our go-to-market strategy is tailored by business development and customer management teams dedicated to each of the four sectors we serve.
785786_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	These teams execute our sector strategies through expertise in advancements within markets and technology as well as unique quality and regulatory capabilities.
785786_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our sector teams help define Plexus' strategy for growth with a particular focus on expanding the value-added solutions we offer customers.
785786_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our financial model aligns with our business strategy.
785786_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our primary focus is to earn a return on invested capital ( ROIC ) 500 basis points in excess of our weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ).
785786_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; at the end of fiscal 2012 we reduced our estimated WACC from 12.5% to 12.0% for fiscal 2013.
785786_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe economic profit is a fundamental driver of shareholder value.
785786_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	Plexus measures economic profit by taking the difference between ROIC and WACC and multiplying it by invested capital.
785786_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	By exercising discipline to generate an ROIC in excess of our WACC, with focus on economic profit, our goal is to ensure that Plexus creates value for our shareholders.
785786_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, flexibility and fulfillment requirements, as well as complex regulatory environments, typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs.
785786_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	The cost variance from our competitors is especially evident relative to those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics).
785786_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with many other technology pioneering start-ups or emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities.
785786_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	As a result of serving market sectors that rely on advanced electronics technology, our business is influenced by critical technological trends such as the level and rate of development of wired and wireless telecommunications infrastructure, communications data and data bandwidth growth, and Internet usage.
785786_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	In addition to prime technology advancements, key government and policy trends impact our business, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's ( FDA ) approval of new medical devices, defense procurement practices, and other government and regulatory processes.
785786_12_ITEM1_P10_S3	Plexus may benefit from increasing outsourcing trends.
785786_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	We provide most of our optimized solutions on a turnkey basis, and we procure some or all materials required for product assembly.
785786_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	We provide select services on a consignment basis, meaning the customer supplies the necessary materials and Plexus provides the labor and other services required for product assembly.
785786_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	In addition to manufacturing, turnkey services require material procurement and warehousing and involve greater resource investments than consignment services.
785786_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Other than certain test equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
785786_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	Established in 1979 as a Wisconsin corporation, we have approximately 9,600 full-time employees, including approximately 1,850 engineers and technologists dedicated to product development and design, test equipment development and design, and manufacturing process development and control, all of whom operate from 25 active facilities in 16 locations, totaling approximately 3.0 million square feet.
785786_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	Plexus' facilities are strategically located to support the global supply chain, as well as manufacturing and engineering needs of customers in our targeted market sectors.
785786_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Plexus maintains a website at www.plexus.com.
785786_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	As soon as is reasonably practical, and after we electronically file or furnish all filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), we provide online copies, free of charge.
785786_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	These reports include: Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports.
785786_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics is also posted on our website.
785786_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	You may access these SEC reports and the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics by following the links under Investor Relations at our website.
785786_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	As an integrated, fully accountable partner, we deliver optimized product realization solutions that carry our customers' products from concept to end of life.
785786_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	Tailoring our Product Realization Value Stream to each product and program, Plexus provides unique solutions designed to meet the needs of each of our customers.
785786_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	As our partnerships grow and mature, we aim to engage our customers in full utilization of our Product Realization Value Stream.
785786_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	During the product development and conceptualization phases, new product ideas are created and evaluated with both the customer's and Plexus' engineering teams.
785786_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	We closely collaborate with our customers to capture their new product vision and clarify requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	Our industrial design team attempts to analyze a product through the end user's eyes focusing on ergonomics, use case research, user interface, aesthetics and evaluation mockups.
785786_12_ITEM1_P16_S3	Upon completion of concept evaluations, the Plexus team prototypes what it believes to be the most promising designs, working concurrently with engineering, manufacturing and supply chain teams.
785786_12_ITEM1_P16_S4	Future phases ensure design intent is maintained, while realizing the final product solution.
785786_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Plexus invests in the latest technology, design and automation tools to provide comprehensive design and value-engineering solutions.
785786_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	Product design includes, but is not limited to, the following solutions:
785786_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Plexus also provides comprehensive value-engineering solutions, extending the product life cycle.
785786_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our value-add solutions span a wide range -- engineering change-order management, cost reduction redesign, component obsolescence management, product feature expansion, test enhancement and component re-sourcing.
785786_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Of all the phases in our Product Realization Value Stream, the commercialize phase carries the most influence with respect to converting ideas into viable products.
785786_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	Commercialization starts early in the design phase and extends through manufacturing transition, often in tandem with Design for Excellence ( DFX ).
785786_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	Our DFX solutions encompass a wide collection of specific design solutions including design for test, design for manufacturability/assembly and design for fabrication.
785786_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	The goal of DFX is to facilitate an efficient transition from engineering to manufacturing.
785786_12_ITEM1_P19_S4	The commercialize phase also includes prototyping, new product introduction, design for supply chain, test development and transition management.
785786_12_ITEM1_P19_S5	We believe our commercialization solutions provide significant value by accelerating time-to-market, reducing change activity and providing customers with a robust and enduring product.
785786_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Plexus applies an optimized manufacturing approach, not a one-size-fits-all model.
785786_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our scalable manufacturing solutions integrate flexibility for our customers through tailored supply chain solutions.
785786_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	Our focus-factory model provides a dedicated team designed to drive success while saving time and money.
785786_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Focus-factories place the customer at the center of operations, executing within a culture of continuous improvement.
785786_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Plexus exclusively focuses on mid-to-low volume, higher-complexity programs that range from lower-level assemblies to finished electro-mechanical products.
785786_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	Our manufactured products typically fall into one of the following categories in our assembly spectrum:
785786_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	System and mechatronic integration products run larger in size than other assemblies; the products range from kiosks to finished healthcare devices and life sciences equipment to other complex electro-mechanical assemblies.
785786_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	These products often combine other integrated solutions we provide and may require further unique facility configurations or supply chain solutions.
785786_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Plexus offers fulfillment and logistics solutions to all our customers in the forms of Direct Order Fulfillment ( DOF ), Build to Order ( BTO ) and Configure to Order ( CTO ).
785786_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	Plexus receives DOF orders from our customers that provide the final specifications required by their end customer.
785786_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	Through BTO and CTO, Plexus delivers the product directly to the end customer.
785786_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	The DOF process relies on Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) systems integrating the overall supply chain, from parts procurement through manufacturing and logistics.
785786_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Plexus provides our customers with a range of solutions support after product launch including sustaining engineering, supply chain, and manufacturing solutions.
785786_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have developed and maintained processes and tools to meet industry-specific requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	We have capabilities to assemble finished medical devices meeting FDA Quality Systems Regulation requirements, and similar regulatory requirements in other countries.
785786_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to the most current revision of the ISO 9001 standard.

785786_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	During fiscal 2012 , we served approximately 140 customers.
785786_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	We offer advanced design and production capabilities, allowing our customers to concentrate on their core competencies.
785786_12_ITEM1_P28_S3	Plexus helps accelerate our customers' time to market, reduce their investment in engineering and manufacturing capacity, and optimize total product cost.
785786_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Juniper Networks, Inc. ( Juniper ) accounted for 16 percent of our net sales in fiscal 2012 , 17 percent in fiscal 2011 and 16 percent in fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales in fiscal 2012 , 2011 or 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	The loss of any of our major customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.
785786_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	On November 5, 2012, Juniper, the Company's largest customer, notified the Company that it will disengage from Plexus.
785786_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Sales to Juniper are primarily made from the Company's AMER and APAC segments.
785786_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	The specific timing of the transition of the Juniper business from Plexus is not known at this time, although it is currently expected to occur by the end of fiscal 2013.
785786_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the financial, operational and other impacts of the disengagement.
785786_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays, modifications and transitions.
785786_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers.
785786_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Customers' forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions.
785786_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations.
785786_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	In addition, as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector.
785786_12_ITEM1_P33_S3	Many of our large customers contract with us through independent multiple divisions, subsidiaries, production facilities or locations.
785786_12_ITEM1_P33_S4	We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others.
785786_12_ITEM1_P33_S5	The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 is shown in the following table:
785786_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Although our current business development focus is based on our targeted market sectors, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources geographically (see Note 12 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments).
785786_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Plexus offers a uniform array of services for customers in each market sector and we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources to particular market sectors, nor internally track our costs and resources per market sector.
785786_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	We typically purchase raw materials, including printed circuit boards and electronic components, from manufacturers and distributors.
785786_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	Under certain circumstances, we will purchase components from brokers, customers or competitors.

785786_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	We may also purchase non-electronic components used in manufacturing and higher-level assembly.
785786_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	These components include molded/formed plastics, sheet metal fabrications, aluminum extrusions, robotics, motors, vision sensors, motion/actuation, fluidics, displays, die castings and various other hardware and fastener components.
785786_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	All components range from standard to highly customized and vary widely in terms of market availability and price.
785786_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Component shortages and subsequent allocations by suppliers are an inherent risk to the electronics industry, and have particularly been an issue for us and the industry in recent years.
785786_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	We discuss the causes of these shortages more fully in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A herein.
785786_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	We actively manage our business to try to minimize our exposure to material and component shortages.
785786_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Plexus global supply chain management organization attempts to create strong supplier alliances and ensure a steady flow of components and products at competitive prices.
785786_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our global expediting and escalation processes track and analyze supply chain health and anticipate constraints.
785786_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	Plexus can often influence the selection of new product components throughout the design phase of the Product Realization Value Stream.
785786_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	The advanced supply chain solutions we develop in partnership with our customers improve the continuity of supply and supply chain flexibility.
785786_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our new business development is organized around our targeted market sectors.
785786_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	Each market sector has a team of dedicated resources.
785786_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	A market development vice president and customer management vice president oversee and provide direct or matrix leadership to business development directors, customer directors, customer managers, business development, supply chain and manufacturing subject matter experts, and market sector analysts.
785786_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our sales and marketing efforts focus on targeting new customers and expanding business with existing customers.
785786_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	We believe our ability to provide a full range of product realization services gives Plexus a marketing advantage; our sector teams participate in marketing through direct customer contact and participation in industry events and seminars.
785786_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	Plexus operates in a highly competitive market, with a goal to be best-in-class at meeting the unique needs of our customers.
785786_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	We provide flexible solutions, timely order fulfillment, and strong engineering, testing and production capabilities.
785786_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	A number of competitors may provide electronics manufacturing and engineering services similar to Plexus.
785786_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	Others may be more established in certain industry sectors, or have greater financial, manufacturing or marketing resources.
785786_12_ITEM1_P45_S2	Smaller competitors compete mainly in specific sectors and within limited geographical areas.
785786_12_ITEM1_P45_S3	Plexus occasionally competes with in-house capabilities of current and potential customers.
785786_12_ITEM1_P45_S4	Plexus maintains strong awareness and knowledge of our competitors' capabilities, in order to remain highly competitive within the broad scope of the EMS industry.
785786_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	We own various service marks that we use in our business; these marks are registered in the trademark offices of the United States and other countries.
785786_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	Although we own certain patents, they are not currently material to our business.
785786_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	We do not have any material copyrights.
785786_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our integrated ERP, warehouse management and shop floor control systems serve all of our manufacturing sites, providing a core set of consistent, global business applications.
785786_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	This consistency augments our other management information systems, allowing us to standardize our ability to translate data from multiple production facilities into operational and financial information.
785786_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	The related software licenses are of a general commercial character on terms customary for these types of agreements.
785786_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	We are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to air emission standards and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process.
785786_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state and foreign environmental laws and do not anticipate any significant expenditures in maintaining our compliance; however, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
785786_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	We are committed to social responsibility within all our business and operations practices.
785786_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our strategies, objectives and targets exemplify thoughtful concern in the areas of human rights, labor practices, the environment, worker health and safety, fair operating practices and the social impact of the organization in the communities where we operate.
785786_12_ITEM1_P50_S2	Our approach to ensuring socially responsible business practices is based on the concepts contained within the International Organization for Standardization's Guidance on Social Responsibility (ISO 26000), input from the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and local and federal legal requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	In order to uphold our reputation and continue to be a responsible and engaged community member, it is imperative that Plexus employees and our business partners follow the highest standards of ethical behavior and personal integrity.
785786_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our Employee and Supplier Codes of Conduct and Business Ethics represent a foundation for these principles; employees and business partners worldwide are expected to adopt and practice their standards.
785786_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	Plexus works to provide a better planet for tomorrow through environmental sustainability efforts.
785786_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	While providing what we believe are best-in-class, high-quality product realization solutions for the electronics industry, we continue to focus on minimizing our impact on the world around us.
785786_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our manufacturing operations are 100% certified under ISO 14001.
785786_12_ITEM1_P52_S3	We maintain Company-wide reduction targets for both carbon emissions and waste generation.
785786_12_ITEM1_P52_S4	We strive to comply with all federal, state and foreign environmental laws and do not anticipate any significant expenditure in maintaining our compliance; however, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
785786_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our employees are one of our primary strengths, and we make a considerable effort to maintain a well-qualified and motivated work force.
785786_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	We have been able to offer enhanced career opportunities to many of our employees.
785786_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	Our human resources department identifies career objectives and monitors specific skill development opportunities for employees with potential for advancement.
785786_12_ITEM1_P53_S3	We invest at all levels of the organization to ensure that employees are well trained.
785786_12_ITEM1_P53_S4	We have a policy of involvement and consultation with employees at every facility and strive for continuous improvement at all levels.
785786_12_ITEM1_P53_S5	We employ approximately 9,600 full-time employees.
785786_12_ITEM1_P53_S6	Given the quick response times required by our customers, we seek to maintain flexibility to scale our operations as necessary to maximize efficiency.
785786_12_ITEM1_P53_S7	To do so we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees.
785786_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	In the United Kingdom, approximately 228 of our employees are covered by union agreements.
785786_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year, although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years.
785786_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	Our employees in China, Germany, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania and the United States are not covered by union agreements.
785786_12_ITEM1_P54_S3	We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities.
785786_12_ITEM1_P54_S4	We believe that our employee relationships are generally positive and stable.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions and world events.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose any of these customers or if there are problems in those market sectors, our net sales and operating results could decline significantly.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 60 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012 , and 55 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	For each of the fiscal years ended September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 , there was one customer that represented 10 percent or more of our net sales.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our principal customers may vary from period to period, and our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all, particularly given the volatile nature of certain programs.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Especially given our discrete number of customers, significant reductions in net sales to any of these customers, the loss of major customers or our failure to make appropriate choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S6	On November 5, 2012, our largest customer, Juniper, notified us that it will disengage with Plexus.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S7	The specific timing of the transition of the Juniper business from Plexus is not known at this time, although it is currently expected to occur by the end of fiscal 2013.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S8	We are currently evaluating the financial, operational and other impacts of the disengagement.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S9	In addition, we focus our net sales to customers in only a few market sectors, and we endeavor to carefully choose those sectors.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Shifts in the performance of a sector served by Plexus, as well as the economic, business and/or regulatory conditions that affect the sector, or our failure to choose appropriate sectors can particularly impact Plexus.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S12	For instance, sales in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector are substantially affected by trends in the healthcare industry, such as government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the financial health of, and pending changes in the structure of, the U.S. health care sector generally, including as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Affordable Care Act").
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S13	Further, potential reductions in U.S. defense spending, including those due to sequestration if the Budget Control Act of 2011 goes into effect on January 1, 2013, could substantially affect our opportunities in our Defense/Security/Aerospace sector.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P2_S14	Any weakness in the market sectors in which our customers are concentrated could affect our business and results of operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	From time to time, our customers, including formerly significant customers, have been affected by merger and acquisition activity.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	While these transactions may present Plexus with opportunities to capture new business, they also create the risk that these customers will partially or completely disengage as a result of transitioning such business to other contract manufacturers or deciding to manufacture the products internally.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Instability in the global financial markets and continuing economic weakness may adversely affect our earnings, liquidity and financial condition.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Global financial markets have been, and continue to be, unstable and unpredictable.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Worldwide economic conditions have been weak and may deteriorate further.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	For example, substantial financial and credit issues have arisen in the European Union as a result of the sovereign debt crisis, currency instability and other factors affecting economies worldwide.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	markets and areas of weakness in the global economy could continue to affect the demand for our customers' products, the amount, timing and stability of their product demand from us, the financial strength of our customers and suppliers, their ability or willingness to do business with us, our willingness to do business with them, our suppliers' and customers' ability to fulfill their obligations to us and/or the ability of us, our customers or our suppliers to obtain credit.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Further, global economic challenges may affect the ability of counterparties to our agreements, including our credit agreement and interest rate swap agreements, to perform their obligations under those agreements.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These factors could adversely affect our operations, earnings and financial condition.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Plexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and currency risks.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We have operations in many countries; operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate now represent a majority of our revenues.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	These international aspects of our operations, which are likely to increase over time, subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results:
785786_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	regulatory requirements and potential changes to those requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We continue to monitor our risk associated with foreign currency translation and have entered into limited forward contracts to address this risk.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As our international operations expand, our failure to appropriately address foreign currency transactions and/or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties, tariffs, taxes or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	For example, our facility in Mexico operates under the Mexican Maquiladora program, which provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations; we could be adversely affected by changes in that program or our failure to comply with its requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our customers do not make long-term commitments and may cancel or change their production requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	EMS companies must respond quickly to the requirements of their customers in both design and production.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Customers also cancel requirements, change engineering or other service requirements, change production quantities, delay production or revise their forecasts for a number of reasons that are beyond our control.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our working capital levels.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred and may continue to occur.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers requirements, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital management, facility requirements, personnel needs and other resource requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S7	The short-term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Since many of our operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our operating results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Moreover, since our margins vary across customers and specific programs, a reduction in demand with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Rapid increases in customer requirements may stress personnel and other capacity resources.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P10_S11	We may not have sufficient resources at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have a complex business model, and our failure to properly manage that model could affect our operations and financial results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our business model focuses on products and services in the mid-to-lower-volume, higher-mix segment of the EMS market.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our customers products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility, necessitating optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solutions across an integrated global platform.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The products we manufacture are also typically complex, highly regulated, and require complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Relative to many of our competitors that manufacture more standardized products with larger production runs, our business model requires a greater degree of attention and resources, including working capital, management and technical personnel, and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse manufacturing, regulatory, and service requirements for multiple programs of varying sizes simultaneously, including in multiple locations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	If we fail to effectively manage our business model, we may lose customer confidence and our reputation may suffer.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P11_S6	The Company s reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P11_S7	If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to maintain or expand business opportunities could be impaired and our financial results could suffer on a going-forward basis.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P11_S8	In addition, the complexity of our service model often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations as well as commitments from us to our customers.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P11_S9	If we fail to meet those obligations, it could result in claims against us and/or affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs could affect our operations and financial results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new work for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to opportunities.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We must initially determine whether it would be in our interests from a business perspective to pursue a particular potential new customer or program, including evaluating the customer s and/or program s fit with our value proposition as well as their end market success.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If we make the decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the anticipated costs, risks, and rewards of an opportunity.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P12_S4	The failure to make prudent engagement decisions and/or to establish appropriate terms of engagement could adversely affect our profitability and margins.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Also, there are inherent risks associated with the timing and ultimate realization of a new program s anticipated revenue; these factors can sometimes extend for a significant period.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Some new programs require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and competencies; in addition, as a result of production startup costs, new programs are inherently less efficient in their earlier phases than mature programs.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We may not meet customer expectations, which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver conforming product on a timely basis.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P12_S8	Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market acceptance, regulatory approvals and/or economic conditions.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P12_S9	The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute on a new program s requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our manufacturing services involve inventory risk.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Most of our contract manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts and/or orders.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	A customer s cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Engineering changes by a customer may result in obsolete materials or components.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory and require customers to reimburse us for these items, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or be able to collect on these obligations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Excess or obsolete inventory, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	These managed inventory programs result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to the risk of enforcing those obligations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction, if any, may seriously harm our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction to adjust to customers needs and market demands.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Plexus regularly contends with these issues and must carefully manage its business to meet customer and market requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Expansion can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	During fiscal 2012, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia (Penang), entered into a strategic arrangement with Kontron and further expanded our employment in Germany (Darmstadt).
785786_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We expect to open a new manufacturing facility in China (Xiamen) in the first half of fiscal 2013.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In addition, in the second half of fiscal 2012, construction began on a facility in Romania (Oradea) to replace a leased facility and on a new manufacturing facility in the U.S. (Neenah, Wisconsin) to replace two existing leased facilities.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We anticipate that both of these facilities will open in the second half of fiscal 2013.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	If we are unable to effectively manage our currently anticipated growth, or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, we may expand our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Other risks of current or future expansion include:
785786_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the expansion.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entail short-term costs, reductions in capacity and/or employment could impair our ability to respond to market improvements or to maintain customer relationships.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	When we make decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring charges.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	In addition, to meet our customers needs, particularly when the production requirements of certain products is site-specific, or to achieve increased efficiencies, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Since customers needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Changes in tax laws, potential tax disputes, negative or unforeseen tax consequences and/or further developments affecting our deferred tax assets could affect our results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The Company has been granted tax holidays for its Malaysian and Xiamen, China subsidiaries.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These tax holidays expire in 2024 and 2013, respectively, and are subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply and would risk adverse tax consequences if we do not.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The expiration of the tax holiday in China is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	However, the Company cannot provide assurances as to the effect and will continue to monitor the projected impact.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Given the scope of our international operations and our international tax arrangements, proposed changes to the manner in which U.S. based multinational companies are taxed in the U.S. could have a material impact on our operating results and competitiveness.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, other recently adopted or potential changes to tax laws in the other jurisdictions in which we operate could also affect our results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Plexus is eligible for up to $15 million in Wisconsin state tax credits in connection with the construction of our new manufacturing facility in Neenah, if we meet certain requirements related to, among other matters, job creation and retention, employee training and capital investment.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If we do not comply with these requirements, we may not be able to realize all, or any, of these tax credits.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	As of September 29, 2012 , approximately $1.0 million has been recognized as a miscellaneous receivable related to the credits.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, as a result of a reduction in forecasted near term profitability in the AMER region, we established a valuation allowance resulting in an additional tax provision of approximately $22.8 million, with an offset to other comprehensive income of $2.2 million, for a net deferred tax asset reduction of $20.6 million.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of an additional valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations, customer-driven and industry standards and third party certification requirements.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to extensive government regulation and industry standards relating to the products we design and manufacture as well as how we conduct our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	These regulations and standards affect the sectors we serve and every aspect of our, and our customers , business, including our labor, employment, workplace safety, environmental, sourcing and import/export practices, as well as many other facets of our operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, as a result of customer requirements and the need to enhance our competitive position, we seek to obtain and maintain various certifications from third parties relating to our quality systems and standards.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods, which can affect both our operations as well as the opportunities in the markets we serve due to the effects on our customers and their end users.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services, and our failure to comply with regulations and certifications, as well as customer-driven and industry standards, could seriously affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is subject to substantial government regulation, primarily from the federal Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and similar regulatory bodies in other countries.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We must comply with statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Failure to comply with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of devices, or total or partial suspension of production.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	The FDA also has the authority to require repair or replacement of equipment, or the refund of the cost of a device manufactured or distributed by our customers.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Violations may lead to penalties or shutdowns of a program or a facility.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Failure or noncompliance could have an adverse effect on our reputation as well as our results of operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P28_S6	In addition, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, as well as the financial health of health care providers, and pending changes in how health care in the U.S. is structured, including as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in this sector as well as impact our margins.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We also design and manufacture products for customers in the defense and aerospace industries.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Companies that design and manufacture products for these industries face significant regulation by the Department of Defense, Department of State, Federal Aviation Authority, and other governmental agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Products for the military are also subject to continued testing of their operations in the field and changing military operational needs, which could affect the possibility and timing of future orders.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Failure to comply with related requirements and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation, the Export Administration Regulation, the Foreign Assets Control Regulation and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, could result in fines, penalties, injunctions, criminal prosecution, and an inability to participate in contracts with the government or their contractors, any of which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The end markets for most of our customers in the Networking/Communications sector are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission, as well as by various governmental agencies.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The policies of these agencies can directly affect both the near-term and long-term demand and profitability of the sector and therefore directly impact the demand for products that we manufacture.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	At the corporate level, as a publicly-held company, we are subject to increasingly stringent laws, regulation and other requirements, including those resulting from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, affecting, among other areas, our accounting, internal controls, corporate governance practices, securities disclosures and reporting; for instance, the SEC recently adopted disclosure requirements related to the use of specified minerals ("conflict minerals") that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured by publicly-held companies.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our failure to comply with these requirements could materially affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly aggressive in enforcing and adopting anti-corruption laws.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, among others, apply to us and our operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These requirements result in compliance costs, and the failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial further costs and/or fines to us as well as affect our reputation.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental regulations pertaining to air, water, and hazardous waste and the health and safety of our workplace.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If we fail to comply with present and future regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or the suspension of business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	These regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur significant expense associated with the ongoing operation of our business or remediation efforts.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Our customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements, industry standards and certification requirements, including many of the industry-specific regulations discussed above.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Our customers' failure to comply could affect their businesses, which in turn would affect our sales to them.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P33_S5	In addition, if our customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs for these customers and create inefficiencies in our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P33_S6	In addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own social responsibility or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Our compliance with these procedures or standards could be costly, and our failure to comply could result in the loss of business with such customers, damage to our reputation and/or have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If we are unable to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise, our results may be adversely affected.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The markets for our manufacturing, engineering and other services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process developments.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our internal processes are also subject to these factors.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	The continued success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to:
785786_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P35_S3	In addition, we may have to acquire new design, assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P35_S4	The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements, and our need to maintain our personnel and other resources during times of fluctuating demand, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	An inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, may adversely affect our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	As a global company with a complex business model, we heavily depend on our information systems to support our customers requirements and to successfully manage our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to system security, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, our failure to maintain adequate data security for both our and our customers financial, product and other information, could substantially affect our business, compliance with regulations and reputation in the industry.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In the current environment, our revenue growth has been heavily biased toward ramping new program wins as compared to end-market growth of mature programs.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The management of resources in connection with the establishment of new or recent programs and customer relationships, as well as program transfers between facilities, and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross and operating margins and level of working capital.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life-cycle of new products and programs, which lack a track record of order volume and timing as well as production efficiencies in the early stages.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We are managing a number of new programs at any given time; therefore, we are exposed to these factors in varying magnitudes.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, if any of these programs or customer relationships were terminated, our operating results could worsen, particularly in the short term.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P38_S3	The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P38_S4	We conduct these transfers on a regular basis to meet customer needs, seek long-term efficiencies or respond to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Although we try to minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between Plexus facilities, there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P38_S6	While these factors tend to affect new, recent or transferred programs, they can also impact more mature, or maturing programs and customer relationships, especially programs where end-market demand can be somewhat volatile.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We may experience raw material and component shortages and price fluctuations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We do not have any long-term supply agreements.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	At various times, including fiscal 2012, we have experienced raw material and component shortages due to supplier capacity constraints or their failure to deliver.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Periodic shortages are expected to occur in the future.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Such constraints can also be caused by world events, such as government policies, terrorism, armed conflict, natural disasters, economic recession and other localized events.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used in the assembly process and, in some cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular raw material or component.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Such suppliers may encounter quality problems, labor disputes, financial difficulties or business continuity issues that could preclude them from delivering raw materials or components timely or at all.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Some suppliers have ceased doing business due to economic or other circumstances, and more may do so in the future.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Supply shortages and delays in deliveries of raw materials or components have in some cases resulted in delayed production of assemblies, which have increased our inventory levels and adversely affected our operating results in certain periods.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S4	An inability to obtain sufficient inventory on a timely basis could also harm relationships with our customers.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S5	In addition, raw materials and components that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Certain materials provided to us may be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S7	The need to obtain replacement materials and parts may negatively affect our manufacturing operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S8	The inadvertent use of any such parts or products may also give rise to liability claims.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S9	Raw material and component supply shortages and delays in deliveries can also result in increased pricing.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S10	While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in raw material or component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S11	Conversely, as a result of our pricing strategies and practices, raw material and component price reductions have contributed positively to our operating results in the past.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P40_S12	Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	There may be problems with the products we design or manufacture that could result in liability claims against us and reduced demand for our services.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The products that we design and/or manufacture may be subject to liability or claims in the event that defects are discovered or alleged.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We design and manufacture products to our customers specifications, many of which are highly complex, and produce products for industries, such as health care, defense and aerospace, that tend to have higher risk profiles.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the design and/or manufacturing of these products, including as a result of business continuity issues.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Whether or not we are responsible, problems in the products we manufacture, whether real or alleged, whether caused by faulty customer specifications, the design or manufacturing processes or a component defect, may result in delayed shipments to customers and/or reduced or canceled customer orders.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P42_S5	In addition, problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P42_S6	These potential claims may include damages for the recall of a product and/or injury to person or property.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P42_S7	Even if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P42_S8	While we seek to insure against many of these risks, insurance coverage may be either inadequate or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P42_S9	We occasionally incur costs defending claims, and any such disputes could affect our business relationships.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our design and manufacturing services and the products offered by our customers involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P43_S3	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P43_S4	In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P43_S5	We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Infringement by our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and disrupt our production.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P43_S7	Additionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P43_S8	Such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products, and could affect our customer relationships more broadly.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P43_S9	Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and components upon which we rely.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our products are for end markets that require technologically advanced products with relatively short life-cycles.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Factors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve, in particular short product life-cycles, could seriously affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Even if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business relationships with them and our production for them, can affect our production cycles, inventory management and results of operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Increased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The EMS industry is highly competitive and has become more so as a result of economic challenges affecting the industry and the economy as a whole.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We compete against numerous EMS providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally and may choose to manufacture products themselves rather than outsource that process.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Consolidations and other changes in the EMS industry result in a changing competitive landscape.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial, manufacturing, engineering, technical, financial, systems, sales and marketing resources than ourselves.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	be better positioned to compete on price for their services.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We may operate at a cost disadvantage compared to other EMS providers that have lower internal cost structures or greater direct buying power with component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or become increasingly competitive.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or loss of market share.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We depend on our workforce, including certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel or other personnel disruptions, including the inability to hire and retain sufficient personnel, may harm our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our success depends in large part on the continued services of our key technical and management personnel, and on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, particularly highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of products.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P50_S2	The competition for these individuals is significant, and the loss of key employees could harm our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P50_S3	From time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, disability, death and other terminations of service that affect our executive officers and other key employees.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Transitions of responsibilities among officers and key employees, particularly those that are unplanned, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, which could have an effect on our results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We also depend on good relationships with our workforce generally.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Any disruption in our relationships with our personnel, including as a result of potential union organizing activities, work actions or other labor issues, could substantially affect our operations and results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	In addition, when we expand operations in either existing areas or new locations, including internationally, we need to attract and retain the services of sufficient qualified personnel to conduct those operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P51_S3	If we fail to retain and maintain sufficient qualified personnel, the operations at those locations, and consequently our financial results, could be adversely affected.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P51_S4	In new or existing facilities we may be subject to local labor practices or union activities, wage pressure and changing wage requirements, increasing health care costs, differing employment laws and regulations in various countries, local competition for employees as well as high turnover, and other issues affecting our workforce, all of which could affect operations at particular locations, which also could have adverse effects on our operational results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Natural disasters and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis and floods.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	All facilities are subject to other natural or man-made disasters such as those related to global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism, breaches of security and failures of utilities.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P52_S3	If such an event was to occur, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P52_S5	In addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P52_S6	If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P52_S7	Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and thus negatively affect our relationships and financial results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We have increased our borrowings, and we may fail to secure or maintain necessary financing.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We have increased our borrowings in recent years.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P53_S2	However, we cannot be certain that our existing credit facilities will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In addition, as a consequence of the turmoil in the global financial markets and banking systems, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit agreement and our interest rate swap agreements, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P53_S5	We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining new credit facilities or a combination of these methods.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P53_S6	We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P53_S7	If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders ownership interests.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P53_S8	Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions, as well as strategic arrangements, and may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or recognize the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We have previously grown, in part, through acquisitions and strategic arrangements.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions, this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	the loss of key employees of acquired businesses.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	the unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In fiscal 2012, we pursued growth through a strategic arrangement with Kontron AG ("Kontron"), as previously disclosed.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Our results may be adversely affected if this arrangement does not deliver the expected revenues and/or margins.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Our stock price has fluctuated significantly in recent periods.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P59_S2	The price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors relating to us, our competitors and the market for our services, many of which are beyond our control.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P59_S3	In addition, the stock market in general, and share prices for technology companies in particular, have from time to time experienced extreme volatility, including weakness, that sometimes has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P59_S4	These broad market and industry fluctuations, and concerns affecting the economy generally, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating results.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Among other things, volatility and weakness in our stock price could mean that investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices that they paid.
785786_12_ITEM1A_P59_S6	Volatility and weakness could also impair our ability in the future to offer common stock or convertible securities as a source of additional capital and/or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses.
785786_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facilities comprise an integrated network of engineering and manufacturing centers with our corporate headquarters located in Neenah, Wisconsin.
785786_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own or lease facilities with approximately 3.2 million square feet of capacity.
785786_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	This includes approximately 1.7 million square feet in the Americas region ( AMER ), approximately 1.3 million square feet in the Asia-Pacific region ( APAC ) and approximately 0.2 million square feet in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region ( EMEA ).
785786_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	Approximately 0.2 million square feet of this capacity is subleased.
785786_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our facilities as of September 29, 2012, are described in the following table:
785786_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) Includes more than one building.
785786_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	(2) This building is subleased and no longer used in our operations.
785786_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	(4) Lease renewal was signed in January 2012 and runs through May 2013.
785786_12_ITEM2_P1_S3	We are currently in negotiations to extend the lease through July 2013 to coincide with the expected completion of the new facility noted below.
785786_12_ITEM2_P1_S4	In fiscal 2012, we began construction of an additional manufacturing facility in Xiamen, China, which is expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
785786_12_ITEM2_P1_S5	We also began construction of a larger facility in Oradea, Romania to replace the leased buildings, which we expect to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
785786_12_ITEM2_P1_S6	Finally, we began construction of a larger facility in Neenah, Wisconsin to replace two leased manufacturing buildings, which we expect to be completed late in fiscal 2013.
785786_12_ITEM2_P1_S7	The Company completed construction of an additional manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia during the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
785786_12_ITEM2_P1_S8	The Company sold a property previously utilized for office and warehouse in Neenah, Wisconsin during the third quarter of fiscal 2012.
785786_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	We were notified in April 2009 by U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) of its intention to conduct a customary Focused Assessment of our import activities during fiscal 2008 and of our processes and procedures to comply with U.S. Customs laws and regulations.
785786_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	During September 2010 , the Company reported errors relating to import trade activity from July 2004 to the date of Plexus' report.
785786_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	In August 2012, CBP issued its final determination of duties and fees owed by Plexus.
785786_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	We have paid into a CBP-maintained escrow account the duties and fees claimed by CBP, pending a ruling from CBP Headquarters which could reduce the duties and fees owed by Plexus.
785786_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	Plexus has implemented improved processes and procedures and has reviewed these corrective measures with CBP.
785786_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	We recorded an accrual in other current accrued liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 when the amount became estimable and probable, which was not material to the financial statements.
785786_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	The accrual has been reduced to reflect our payment into the CBP escrow account.
785786_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	At this time, we do not believe that any deficiencies in processes or controls or unanticipated costs, unpaid duties or penalties associated with this matter will have a material adverse effect on Plexus or the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
785786_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	As a result of the anticipated resolution of this matter, we do not intend to further report on it absent material developments.
785786_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	The Company is party to certain other lawsuits in the ordinary course of business.
785786_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	Management does not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

785786_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market Price per Share For the fiscal years ended September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 , the Company s common stock has traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market, in the NASDAQ Global Select Market tier.
785786_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	The price information below represents high and low sale prices of our common stock for each quarterly period.
785786_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total return on Plexus common stock with the NASDAQ Stock Market Index for U.S. Companies and the NASDAQ Stock Market Index for Electronic Components Companies, both of which include Plexus.
785786_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	The values on the graph show the relative performance of an investment of $100 made on September 29, 2007 , in Plexus common stock and in each of the indices as of the last business day of the respective fiscal year.
785786_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	Shareholders of Record; Dividends As of November 14, 2012 , there were approximately 600 shareholders of record.
785786_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	We have not paid any cash dividends in the past.
785786_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	We currently anticipate that the majority of earnings in the foreseeable future will be retained to finance the development of our business.
785786_12_ITEM5_P2_S3	However, the Company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_12_ITEM5_P2_S4	See also Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources , for a discussion of the Company s intentions regarding dividends, and loan covenants which could restrict dividend payments.
785786_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On October 23, 2012, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes Plexus to repurchase up to $50 million of its common stock.
785786_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	However, Plexus did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in fiscal 2012.
785786_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) In fiscal 2012, we established a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets resulting in an additional tax provision of approximately $20.6 million ($22.8 million provision, offset by $2.2 million to other comprehensive income) and a decrease in diluted earnings per share of $0.64.
785786_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	Return on invested capital excludes the $20.6 million net deferred tax asset reduction.
785786_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	In fiscal 2009, we recorded goodwill impairment charges related to our United Kingdom operations of $5.7 million.
785786_12_ITEM6_P1_S1	In addition, we recorded pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $2.8 million which related primarily to the reduction of workforce in the United States and Mexico as well as fixed assets written down related to the closure of our Ayer, Massachusetts ("Ayer") facility.
785786_12_ITEM6_P1_S2	A favorable tax adjustment of approximately $1.4 million, primarily related to the conclusion of federal and state audits, was also recorded.
785786_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	(3) In fiscal 2008, we recorded pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $2.1 million which related primarily to the closure of our Ayer facility and the reduction of our workforce in Mexico.
785786_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	(4) The Company defines return on invested capital as tax-effected annualized operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period.
785786_12_ITEM6_P3_S1	Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents.
785786_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	* Amounts have been revised to adjust the prior classification, as discussed in Note 16 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	OVERVIEW Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together Plexus, the Company, or we ) participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ( EMS ) industry.

785786_12_ITEM7_P0_S9	We provide most of our contract manufacturing services on a turnkey basis, which means that we procure some or all of the materials required for product assembly.
785786_12_ITEM7_P0_S10	We provide some services on a consignment basis, which means that the customer supplies the necessary materials, and we provide the labor and other services required for product assembly.
785786_12_ITEM7_P0_S11	Turnkey services require material procurement and warehousing, in addition to manufacturing, and involve greater resource investments than consignment services.
785786_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Other than certain test equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
785786_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Beginning in fiscal 2013, we renamed our Medical market sector as the Healthcare/Life Sciences market sector.
785786_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	This change stems from our evolving strategy and enhanced capabilities within this market and reflects the industry's progression to holistic patient care.
785786_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	We believe Healthcare/Life Sciences more accurately defines this growing industry and aligns with our existing and targeted customer base.
785786_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	The following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A herein.
785786_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 (dollars in millions, except per share data):
785786_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2012 increased $75.5 million , or 3.4 percent , as compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	resulted from higher net sales in all of our market sectors, except for a decrease in the networking/communications sector.
785786_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	The net sales increase primarily related to the continued ramp of production for a significant industrial/commercial sector customer and $81.9 million of incremental revenue from the previously announced strategic arrangement with Kontron (the "Kontron arrangement"), as well as program ramps from several other existing customers.
785786_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	These increases in net sales were partially offset by decreased sales in the networking/communications sector due to lower end-market demand and the two previously announced customer disengagements due to the acquisition of such customers.
785786_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	See below regarding an intended disengagement by Juniper, our largest customer.
785786_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $217.8 million , or 10.8 percent , as compared to fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	The net sales increase resulted from higher net sales in all of our market sectors, except for a decrease in the networking/communications sector.
785786_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	The net sales increase primarily related to the ramp of production for a then-newer industrial/commercial sector customer.
785786_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	Net sales to Juniper increased as a result of improved end-market demand for the mix of Juniper products we produce as well as new product launches.
785786_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	Overall, we had net sales increases spread across new and existing customers in both the industrial/commercial and healthcare/life sciences sectors during fiscal 2011, which were partially offset by the two customer disengagements noted above in the networking/communications market sector.
785786_12_ITEM7_P4_S5	Our net sales by market sector for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in millions):
785786_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Net sales for the networking/communications sector decreased $126.3 million for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	The decline in the sector was primarily the result of the impact from the prior year disengagement of two significant customers noted above of approximately $74.9 million and overall unfavorable end-market trends reflecting global economic uncertainty.
785786_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Net sales to Juniper did not change significantly from fiscal 2011.
785786_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Net sales for the networking/communications sector decreased $70.1 million for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	The decline in the sector was a result of the disengagements and end-market trends noted above.
785786_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	Net sales to Juniper in fiscal 2011 increased as a result of improved end-market demand for the mix of Juniper products we produce as well as new product launches.
785786_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	Net sales for the industrial/commercial sector increased $142.8 million for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P6_S5	The increase was primarily attributable to the continued ramp of a significant customer and $81.9 million of incremental revenue related to the Kontron arrangement, as well as the addition of a new customer in this sector.
785786_12_ITEM7_P6_S6	Net sales for the industrial/commercial sector increased $169.0 million for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P6_S7	The increase in the sector was a result of the ramp of production for the significant customer noted above.
785786_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net sales for the healthcare/life sciences sector increased $24.2 million for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	The increase was primarily due to market share gain and new programs with existing customers.
785786_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Net sales for the healthcare/life sciences sector increased $70.9 million for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	The increase was due to higher overall end-market demand in the market sector.
785786_12_ITEM7_P7_S4	Net sales for the defense/security/aerospace sector increased $34.8 million for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P7_S5	The increase was primarily due to stronger end-market demand in the aerospace market as well as the addition of a new customer in this sector.
785786_12_ITEM7_P7_S6	Net sales for the defense/security/aerospace sector increased $48.0 million for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P7_S7	The increase in the sector was primarily due to increased demand from an existing customer as a result of new program wins and a program ramp for a new customer.
785786_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	The percentages of net sales to customers representing 10 percent or more of net sales and net sales to our ten largest customers for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were as follows:
785786_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	On November 5, 2012, Juniper notified us that it will disengage with Plexus.
785786_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	The specific timing of the transition of the Juniper business from Plexus is not known at this time, although it is currently expected to occur by the end of fiscal 2013.
785786_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the financial, operational and other impacts of the disengagement.
785786_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	For fiscal 2012 , gross profit increased $5.2 million compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the net sales increase.
785786_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase was partially offset by increased fixed expenses related to higher headcount to support the revenue growth, costs related to the addition of a fourth facility in Penang, Malaysia of approximately $5.9 million, transition costs due to the Kontron arrangement, and an unfavorable change in customer mix.
785786_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Customer mix negatively impacted gross profit due to a higher portion of sales from new programs, which tend to be inherently less profitable during early production stages than mature programs.
785786_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	Gross profit was also negatively impacted by escalated pricing pressure, particularly in our networking/communications sector.
785786_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	These factors led to the reduction in gross margin from 9.6 percent for fiscal 2011 to 9.5 percent for fiscal 2012 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	For fiscal 2011 , gross profit increased $7.8 million compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased net sales in all of our market sectors except networking/communications, driven by demand from new and existing customers across the majority of our market sectors, partially offset by unfavorable changes in customer mix, which together accounted for approximately $32.4 million of the net increase in gross profit.
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	This increase was partially offset by an increase in fixed manufacturing costs due to increased headcount expenses to support revenue growth of approximately $15.5 million.
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Fixed costs also grew as a percentage of sales as a result of expansion in our APAC and EMEA regions as they ramped to capacity, as well as the underutilization of two AMER facilities, due to the disengagement of a significant customer and the slower ramp of a significant customer, increased depreciation expense of $5.5 million due to the expansions mentioned above, and the effect of the non-recurrence of a $3.2 million benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 from a litigation settlement.
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	These factors led to the reduction in gross margin from 10.3 percent for fiscal 2010 to 9.6 percent for fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	For fiscal 2012 , operating income increased $3.0 million compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S5	The operating income increase reflected the $5.2 million increase in gross profit described above, partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in selling and administrative expenses ( S A ).
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S6	The dollar increase in S A is primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, $1.3 million of amortization expense resulting from an intangible asset related to the Kontron arrangement, and an increase in other personnel expenses.
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S7	These increases were partially offset by approximately $2.4 million of recoveries of receivables previously at risk.
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S8	As a result of the factors discussed above, for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 , operating margin remained at 4.5 percent .
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S9	For fiscal 2011 , operating income increased $1.5 million compared to fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S10	The operating income increase reflected the $7.8 million increase in gross profit described above, partially offset by a $6.3 million increase in S A.
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S11	The increase in S A expenses was due to increased employee compensation and relocation expense of approximately $8.1 million as a result of higher headcount to support revenue growth, as well as higher stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.1 million.
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S12	These increases were partially offset by approximately $4.1 million of lower variable incentive compensation in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010.
785786_12_ITEM7_P12_S13	The above factors led to a reduction of operating margin to 4.5 percent for fiscal 2011 from 4.9 percent for fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Other expense increased to $12.9 million for fiscal 2012 from $9.1 million for fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in expense was largely due to $4.4 million of increased interest expense primarily related to the $175 million of borrowings under the Note Purchase Agreement that the Company entered into during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below.
785786_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Other expense for fiscal 2011 decreased to $9.1 million from $9.2 million in fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	This change was driven by the favorable fluctuation in foreign currency transactions of $2.4 million, partially offset by increased interest expense of $2.1 million, primarily related to the $175 million of borrowings noted above, which we entered into during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources below.
785786_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Income taxes and effective annual income tax rates for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Income tax expense for fiscal 2012 increased to $29.1 million compared $2.8 million for fiscal 2011 and $0.9 million for fiscal 2010 , as a result of the increase in our effective tax rate.
785786_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	These rates primarily vary from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent as a result of the amount of earnings from different U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and tax holidays granted to our subsidiaries in China and Malaysia, where we derive a significant portion of our earnings.
785786_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 is significantly higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the additional valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets in the U.S. of $22.8 million, which is discussed further below.
785786_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	The fiscal 2012 effective tax rate, adjusted for the valuation allowance to 7%, and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 were higher than the effective tax rate for 2010 primarily as a result of increased profitability in the U.S. tax jurisdiction.
785786_12_ITEM7_P15_S4	Our effective tax rate could fluctuate in the future depending on the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings.
785786_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	During the preparation of the Company's fiscal 2012 consolidated financial statements, the Company performed an analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, regarding the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, consistent with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
785786_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Under these accounting rules, the weight given to positive and negative evidence is proportionate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.
785786_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	It is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objectively verifiable negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses.
785786_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Accordingly, as of September 29, 2012, the Company established an additional valuation allowance of $20.6 million ($22.8 million provision, offset by $2.2 million to other comprehensive income) against our U.S. deferred tax assets.
785786_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	This was based on the significant negative evidence of the Company's U.S. cumulative loss position and the deterioration of our forecasts late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for fiscal 2013, which has impacted forecasted profitability in the near term in the AMER region.
785786_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	We currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 to be approximately 6 to 8 percent .
785786_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	The rate is consistent with the fiscal 2012 rate before the effects of the valuation allowance are taken into account.
785786_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	The Company has been granted tax holidays for its Malaysian and Xiamen, China subsidiaries.
785786_12_ITEM7_P17_S6	These tax holidays expire in 2024 and 2013, respectively, and are subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply.
785786_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The expiration of the tax holiday in China is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate.
785786_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	However, we cannot provide any assurances as to the effect and will continue to monitor the projected impact.
785786_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	In fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , these subsidiaries generated income, which resulted in tax reductions of approximately $17.5 million ( $0.50 per basic share), $21.7 million ( $0.57 per basic share) and $23.0 million ( $0.58 per basic share), respectively.
785786_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Primarily as a result of the valuation allowance adjustment discussed above, net income for fiscal 2012 decreased by $27.2 million , or 30.4 percent , to $62.1 million from fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	Excluding the valuation allowance adjustment, net income was $84.9 million, a decrease of $4.4 million, or 4.9 percent from fiscal 2011 as a result of higher fixed expenses and increased interest expense, partially offset by the effect of higher net sales.
785786_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	Primarily as a result of lower gross margins and increases to income tax expense, net income for fiscal 2011 decreased by $0.3 million , or 0.3 percent , to $89.3 million from fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	Diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.75 for fiscal 2012 from $2.30 for fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the valuation allowance adjustment discussed above.
785786_12_ITEM7_P19_S5	Excluding the valuation allowance adjustment, diluted earnings per share increased to $2.39 for fiscal 2012.
785786_12_ITEM7_P19_S6	The increase in diluted earnings per share excluding the valuation allowance adjustment was primarily due to the effect of a decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchases completed late in fiscal 2011, partially offset by lower net income.
785786_12_ITEM7_P19_S7	Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.30 for fiscal 2011 from $2.19 for fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P19_S8	The increase in diluted earnings per share was primarily due to the effect of a decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchases completed in fiscal 2011, partially offset by the slight decrease in net income previously noted.
785786_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Return on Invested Capital ( ROIC ).
785786_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	We use a 5-10-5 financial model which is aligned with our business strategy, and includes a ROIC goal of 500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ), a 10% gross margin target and a 5% operating margin target.
785786_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	enough cash to self-fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of 15%.
785786_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually, and our estimated WACC was 12.5 percent for fiscal 2012.
785786_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders.
785786_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	ROIC was 15.5% (excluding $20.6 million net deferred tax asset reduction), 15.6% and 19.5% for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
785786_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	The decrease from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 was due primarily to slightly lower tax-effected annualized operating income as a result of a higher effective tax rate.
785786_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	See the table below for our calculation of ROIC (dollars in millions):
785786_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	We define ROIC as tax-effected annualized operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period for the fiscal year.
785786_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents.
785786_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way.
785786_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure which should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
785786_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance.
785786_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	In particular, we provide ROIC because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view ROIC as an important measure in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital requirements.
785786_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	We also use a derivative measure of ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation.
785786_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	For a reconciliation of ROIC to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
785786_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	REPORTABLE SEGMENTS A further discussion of our fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 financial performance by reportable segment is presented below (in millions):
785786_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2012 decreased $49.0 million , or 3.8 percent , from fiscal 2011 , primarily as a result of decreased end-market demand in the networking/communications sector, which included the loss of two significant networking/communications customers, one as a result of a previously announced customer disengagement and the other as a result of a drop in end-market demand for the mix of products we produce for that customer.
785786_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	These decreases were partially offset by the ramp of production for our significant industrial/commercial sector customer and the addition of a new customer in this sector as well.
785786_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net sales to Juniper did not change significantly from fiscal 2011.
785786_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	million and $2.4 million of recoveries of receivables previously at risk.
785786_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $60.2 million , or 4.8 percent , from fiscal 2010 , which reflected the ramp of production for our newer industrial/commercial sector customer.
785786_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	Net sales to Juniper also increased as a result of improved end-market demand for the mix of Juniper products we produce in the region as well as new product launches.
785786_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	These increases were offset by reduced net sales to two significant networking/communications customers, as noted above.
785786_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	Operating income for fiscal 2011 decreased $5.7 million from fiscal 2010 due to fiscal 2010 benefiting from a $3.2 million litigation settlement, as well as unfavorable changes in customer mix in fiscal 2011.
785786_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Asia-Pacific (APAC): Net sales for fiscal 2012 increased $47.3 million , or 4.4 percent , from fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	This growth reflected incremental revenue from the Kontron arrangement of approximately $81.9 million as well as higher net sales to multiple customers across our market sectors.
785786_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	These increases were partially offset by decreased net sales from the previously announced disengagement of one customer in the networking/communications sector and a decline in end-market demand for the mix of products we produce for another customer in this sector as well for an industrial/commercial sector customer.
785786_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	Operating income decreased $16.2 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 , primarily as a result of costs related to the addition of a fourth facility in Penang, Malaysia of approximately $5.9 million, increased expenses related to higher headcount to support capacity investments, transition costs for the Kontron arrangement and escalated pricing pressure.
785786_12_ITEM7_P29_S4	Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $137.7 million , or 14.9 percent , from fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P29_S5	This growth reflected higher net sales to multiple customers across our market sectors as well as increased demand from a new customer in the industrial/commercial sector.
785786_12_ITEM7_P29_S6	These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales from the previously announced disengagement of one customer in the networking/communications sector as well as a drop in end-market demand for the mix of products we produce for an additional networking/communications customer.
785786_12_ITEM7_P29_S7	Operating income improved $3.3 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 , primarily as a result of the net sales growth, partially offset by unfavorable changes in customer mix and higher fixed expenses.
785786_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) : Net sales for fiscal 2012 increased $3.2 million , or 3.5 percent , from fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase in net sales was driven primarily by the addition of new customers in each of our market sectors, partially offset by decreased net sales to an industrial/commercial customer as a result of reduced end-market demand for the mix of products we produce for that customer.
785786_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	Operating results improved in the current year as compared to the prior year due to increased profitability in Romania based on the mix of customers and increased leverage at the facility.
785786_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $19.6 million , or 27.2 percent , from fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	The change in net sales was driven by higher demand from two existing customer programs as well as the ramp of production for two new customers.
785786_12_ITEM7_P30_S5	Operating results were lower in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to increased operating costs from our Romania facility and our new engineering facility in Darmstadt, Germany.
785786_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents were $297.6 million as of September 29, 2012 compared to $242.1 million as of October 1, 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	The increase in the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to cash generated from operations, partially offset by cash used for the Kontron arrangement, capital expenditures and payments on debt.
785786_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	As of September 29, 2012 , approximately two-thirds of our cash balance was held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries.
785786_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	Certain foreign countries impose taxes and overall penalties on transfers of cash; however, our intent is to permanently reinvest funds held in these countries.
785786_12_ITEM7_P31_S4	If this cash were remitted to the U.S., additional tax obligations may result that would reduce the amount of cash ultimately available to us in the U.S.
785786_12_ITEM7_P31_S5	Currently, we believe that cash held in the U.S., together with cash available under U.S. credit facilities and cash from foreign subsidiaries that could be remitted to the U.S. without tax consequences, will be sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.
785786_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	The table below shows a summary of cash flows for fiscal 2012 and 2011 (in millions):
785786_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $157.5 million for fiscal 2012 , as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $158.5 million for fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased slightly due to lower net income, partially offset by overall improved working capital management.
785786_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $158.5 million for fiscal 2011 , as compared to cash flows used in operating activities of $(7.6) million for fiscal 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P33_S3	During fiscal 2011, the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily the result of improvements in working capital management.
785786_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table shows a summary of cash cycle days for the periods indicated (in days):
785786_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	We calculate days in accounts receivable as accounts receivable for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	We calculate days in inventory, accounts payable, and cash deposits as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	Days in accounts receivable for the three months ended September 29, 2012 increased by one day compared to the three months ended October 1, 2011 , primarily due to the timing of net sales at the end of the current year period.
785786_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	Days in inventory for the three months ended September 29, 2012 decreased by seven days compared to the three months ended October 1, 2011 , due to our efforts to actively manage inventory levels down with the assistance of our customers, while continuing to meet our customers needs for flexibility and agility as well as support revenue growth.
785786_12_ITEM7_P35_S4	Days in accounts payable for the three months ended September 29, 2012 increased by one day compared to the three months ended October 1, 2011 , primarily due to the timing of the purchases during the quarter.
785786_12_ITEM7_P35_S5	Days in cash deposits for the three months ended September 29, 2012 were consistent with the three months ended October 1, 2011 at six days.
785786_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	We calculate cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits.
785786_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	As of September 29, 2012 cash cycle days decreased by seven days compared to October 1, 2011 due to the factors noted above.
785786_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Free cash flow ( FCF ), which we define as cash flow provided by (used in) operations less capital expenditures, increased for fiscal 2012 , to $93.8 million , as compared to FCF of $87.6 million for fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Better management of working capital partially offset by lower net income led to this improvement for fiscal 2012 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure which should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
785786_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	We provide FCF because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions.
785786_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	We view FCF as an important financial metric as it demonstrates our ability to generate cash and allows us to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.
785786_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Below is a reconciliation of FCF to our financial statements that was prepared using GAAP for fiscal 2012 and 2011 (in millions):
785786_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $92.2 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $68.7 million for fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Cash flows used in investing activities increased primarily due to the expenditure of $34.2 million of cash related to the Kontron arrangement in fiscal 2012 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal 2011 increased slightly from fiscal 2010 to $68.7 million primarily due to capital expenditures for new facilities in Penang, Malaysia and Xiamen, China.
785786_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	We utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal 2012 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P40_S4	We currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 to be approximately $100 million.
785786_12_ITEM7_P40_S5	A significant portion of the fiscal 2013 capital expenditures is anticipated to be used for the construction of our previously announced manufacturing facilities in Neenah, Wisconsin and Oradea, Romania to replace leased buildings in both locations.
785786_12_ITEM7_P40_S6	We believe the estimated capital expenditures will continue to be funded from operations, and may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, if required, although we can provide no assurances.
785786_12_ITEM7_P40_S7	Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $10.8 million for fiscal 2012 , as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $37.0 million for fiscal 2011 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P40_S8	Cash flows used in financing activities for fiscal 2012 were comprised primarily of payments on debt, partially offset by debt proceeds and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
785786_12_ITEM7_P40_S9	Cash flows used in financing activities for fiscal 2011 were comprised primarily of repurchases of common stock and payments on debt, partially offset by debt proceeds and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
785786_12_ITEM7_P40_S10	Cash flows provided by financing in fiscal 2010 were primarily due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by payments on our term debt and capital leases.
785786_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	On May 15, 2012, the Company entered into a five-year, $250 million senior unsecured credit facility that terminates on May 15, 2017 (the Credit Facility ).
785786_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	The Credit Facility includes a $160 million revolving credit facility and a $90 million term loan.
785786_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	The revolving credit facility potentially may be increased by $100 million (the "increase option") to $260 million generally by mutual agreement of the Company, the lenders, the letter of credit issuers and the administrative agent named in the related credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), subject to certain customary conditions.
785786_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	The Credit Facility was used to refinance the Company's then-existing $100 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (no amounts were outstanding as of May 15, 2012) and its $150 million senior unsecured term loan (balance of $90.0 million as of May 15, 2012), both of which were scheduled to mature on April 4, 2013, and for general corporate purposes.
785786_12_ITEM7_P41_S4	Quarterly principal repayments of the Credit Facility term loan of $3.75 million per quarter began June 29, 2012 and end on March 28, 2013.
785786_12_ITEM7_P41_S5	The final $75 million payment is due on May 15, 2017.
785786_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	The financial covenants (as defined under the Credit Facility) require that the Company maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
785786_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	As of September 29, 2012 , the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility.
785786_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Facility, at the Company's option, bear interest at a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the Company's leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement.
785786_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Rates would increase upon negative changes in specified Company financial metrics and would decrease upon reduction in the current total leverage ratio, to no less than LIBOR plus 1.00% or the base rate plus 0%.
785786_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	We are also required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused revolver credit commitment based on our leverage ratio; the fee was 0.20% as of September 29, 2012 .
785786_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement ) for $175 million in principal amount of 5.20% Senior Notes, due June 15, 2018 (the Notes ).
785786_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	We issued $100 million in principal amount of the Notes on April 21, 2011, and the remaining $75 million on June 15, 2011.
785786_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Note Purchase Agreement contains certain financial covenants, which include a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth test, all as defined in the agreements.
785786_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	As of September 29, 2012 , we were in compliance with all debt covenants.
785786_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Credit Facility and Note Purchase Agreement allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the future repurchases of shares provided that no event of default (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases.
785786_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	We have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not currently anticipate paying them in the future.
785786_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	However, we evaluate from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	On October 23, 2012, the Company received approval from the Board of Directors for a new stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $50 million of its common stock.
785786_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	It is anticipated that this program will be funded with existing cash and is expected to be executed quarterly, on a relatively consistent basis, during fiscal 2013.
785786_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, the Credit Facility, and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.
785786_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Further, $160 million of committed credit is currently available under the Credit Facility, with another $100 million potentially available pursuant to the increase option.
785786_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing.
785786_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources.
785786_12_ITEM7_P48_S4	However, particularly due to the current uncertainty of the credit and financial markets, we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms.
785786_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Additionally, the Company enters interest rate swaps and foreign currency derivatives to hedge against variable cash flows.
785786_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their estimated fair value.
785786_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
785786_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	See Note 6 - Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements for further details.
785786_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we entered into two separate treasury rate lock hedge contracts to hedge the variability of the fixed interest rate on the then forecasted issuance of the Notes using a treasury lock transaction.
785786_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	The fixed interest rates for each of these contracts are 2.77% and 2.72%, respectively, with a notional value of $150 million.
785786_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	On April 4, 2011, we entered into a final treasury rate lock hedge transaction for the remaining $25 million of exposure at a rate of 2.88%.
785786_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	On April 8, 2011, when the fixed interest rate for the debt issuance was determined, all three treasury rate lock contracts were settled and we received proceeds of $2.3 million, which is being amortized over the seven year term of the related debt.
785786_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings.
785786_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 29, 2012 (dollars in millions):
785786_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	1) During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we entered into the Credit Facility and immediately funded a term loan for $90 million.
785786_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	As of September 29, 2012 , the outstanding balance was $82.5 million .
785786_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	The amounts listed above include interest; see Note 5 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we entered into the Note Purchase Agreement and issued $175.0 million in principal amount of notes.
785786_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	As of September 29, 2012 , the outstanding balance was $175.0 million .
785786_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	The amounts listed above include interest; see Note 5 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	3) As of September 29, 2012 , purchase obligations consist of commitments to purchase inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business.
785786_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	4) As of September 29, 2012 , other long-term obligations on the balance sheet included deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers, as well as other key employees, and an asset retirement obligation.
785786_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	We have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately $7.6 million , as of September 29, 2012 , related to unrecognized income tax benefits.
785786_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Company cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to this obligation.
785786_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	5) As of September 29, 2012 , other long-term obligations not on the balance sheet consisted of commitments to build new manufacturing facilities in Neenah, Wisconsin and Oradea, Romania as well as a commitment for salary continuation in the event employment of one executive officer of the Company is terminated without cause.
785786_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	We did not have, and were not subject to, any lines of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations, other off-balance sheet arrangements or other commercial commitments that we believe are material.
785786_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	During fiscal 2012, there were no material changes to these policies.
785786_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our more critical accounting policies are noted below: Stock-Based Compensation The Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	We used the modified prospective application, under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning with the first period that we adopted the FASB regulation and continuing to be expensed thereafter.
785786_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	We continue to use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value stock options.
785786_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	See Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
785786_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	Recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property, plant and equipment are expected to generate.
785786_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value.
785786_12_ITEM7_P62_S3	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_12_ITEM7_P62_S4	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings.
785786_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Revenue Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled.
785786_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with durations of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling, if applicable.
785786_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value.
785786_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability (a fair value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge), or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.
785786_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
785786_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualify as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability.
785786_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income , until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
785786_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in the Accumulated other comprehensive income accounts within shareholders equity.
785786_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	and Fair Value Measurements for further details.
785786_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
785786_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
785786_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_12_ITEM7_P70_S3	Accordingly, the Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
785786_12_ITEM7_P70_S4	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_12_ITEM7_P70_S5	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
785786_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, as a result of a reduction in forecasted near term profitability in the AMER region, we established a valuation allowance resulting in an additional tax provision of approximately $22.8 million, with an offset to other comprehensive income of $2.2 million, for a net additional allowance amount of $20.6 million.
785786_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Foreign Currency Risk We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We enter into forward contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated transactions in our APAC reportable segment, as described in Note 6, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for fiscal 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 were as follows:
785786_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Based on the Company s overall currency exposure, as of September 29, 2012 , a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have financial instruments, including cash equivalents and short-term investments as well as debt, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We consider the use of interest-rate swaps based on existing market conditions.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We have entered into interest rate swaps for $82.5 million in term loans, as described in Note 6, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As is common with these types of agreements, our interest rate swaps are subject to the further risk that the counterparties to these agreements may fail to comply with their obligations thereunder.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	To achieve this, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of highly rated securities, money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Our only material interest rate risk as of September 29, 2012 , is associated with our Credit Facility under which we borrowed $90 million.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P5_S3	Through the use of interest rate swaps, as described above, we have fixed the basis on which we pay interest, thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk.
785786_12_ITEM7A_P5_S4	A 10 percent change in the weighted average interest rate on our average long-term borrowings would have had only a nominal impact on interest expense.
785786_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	See Part IV, Item 15 on page 40.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures: The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have reviewed and evaluated, with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date ).
785786_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on such evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective (a) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, and (b) in assuring that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
785786_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management of the Company, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2012 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
785786_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on its assessment and those criteria, management of the Company has concluded that, as of September 29, 2012 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2012 , as stated in their report included herein on page 42.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls: Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P2_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
785786_12_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have nonetheless reached the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Plexus Corp.:
785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries at September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S2	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S3	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2012 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S4	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S5	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S6	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S8	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S9	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S10	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
785786_12_ITEM15_P3_S11	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
785786_12_ITEM15_P4_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
785786_12_ITEM15_P4_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
785786_12_ITEM15_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
785786_12_ITEM15_P4_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

785786_12_ITEM15_P12_S3	The Company's customers products typically require exceptional production and supply-chain flexibility, necessitating an optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solution across an integrated global platform.
785786_12_ITEM15_P12_S4	Many of the Company's customers products require complex configuration management and direct order fulfillment to their customers across the globe.
785786_12_ITEM15_P12_S5	In such cases Plexus provides global logistics management and after-market service and repair.

785786_12_ITEM15_P14_S3	The Company also uses a 4-4-5 weekly accounting system for the interim periods in each quarter.
785786_12_ITEM15_P14_S4	Each quarter, therefore, ends on a Saturday at the end of the 4-4-5 period.
785786_12_ITEM15_P14_S5	Periodically, an additional week must be added to the fiscal year to re-align with the Saturday closest to September 30.
785786_12_ITEM15_P15_S0	The accounting years for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 each included 364 days.

785786_12_ITEM15_P17_S1	Refer to Note 16, "Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements," for further discussion of these revisions.
785786_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months and are classified as Level 1 in the fair level hierarchy described below.
785786_12_ITEM15_P18_S1	As of September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 , cash and cash equivalents were the following (in thousands):
785786_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
785786_12_ITEM15_P19_S1	Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
785786_12_ITEM15_P19_S2	Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment.
785786_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond the Company s control.
785786_12_ITEM15_P20_S1	Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory.
785786_12_ITEM15_P20_S2	Any actions taken by the Company s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.
785786_12_ITEM15_P20_S3	Per contractual terms, customer deposits are received by the Company to offset obsolete and excess inventory risks.
785786_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation: These assets are stated at cost.
785786_12_ITEM15_P21_S1	Depreciation, determined on the straight-line method, is based on lives assigned to the major classes of depreciable assets as follows:
785786_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	Certain facilities and equipment held under capital leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the lease terms and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities.
785786_12_ITEM15_P22_S1	Lease amortization is included in depreciation expense (see Note 4, "Property, Plant and Equipment") and the financing component of the lease payments is classified as interest expense.
785786_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	For the capitalization of software costs, the Company capitalizes significant costs incurred in the acquisition or development of software for internal use, including the costs of the software, consultants as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees directly involved in developing internal use computer software once the final selection of the software is made.
785786_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	Costs incurred prior to the final selection of software and costs not qualifying for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
785786_12_ITEM15_P23_S2	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
785786_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable through estimated future undiscounted cash flows.
785786_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a charge against current operations.
785786_12_ITEM15_P24_S2	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_12_ITEM15_P24_S3	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.
785786_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.
785786_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as program costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_12_ITEM15_P27_S2	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_12_ITEM15_P27_S3	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_12_ITEM15_P27_S4	Net sales from engineering design and development services were less than five percent of total sales for each of fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
785786_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured products based on management s analysis of historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling.
785786_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are provided for the difference between the financial statement balance of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
785786_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized (see Note 7, "Income Taxes").
785786_12_ITEM15_P29_S2	Realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the Company s ability to generate future taxable income.
785786_12_ITEM15_P29_S3	Recognition of deferred income tax assets is evaluated and tax reserves are recorded to address potential exposures related to income tax positions taken by the Company.
785786_12_ITEM15_P29_S4	These reserves are based on the assumptions and past experiences of the Company and provide for the uncertainty surrounding the application of statutes, rules, regulations, and interpretations to its income tax filings.
785786_12_ITEM15_P29_S5	It is possible that the actual costs or benefits relating to these matters may be materially more or less than the amount the Company estimated.
785786_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	Foreign Currency Translation: The Company translates assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at year-end.
785786_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	The Company translates net sales, expenses and cash flows at the average monthly exchange rates during the respective periods.
785786_12_ITEM15_P30_S2	Adjustments resulting from translation of the financial statements are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income .
785786_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	the entity involved and remeasurement adjustments for foreign operations where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency are included in our Statements of Operations as a component of miscellaneous income (expense).
785786_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	Exchange gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions were $0.2 million , $1.0 million , and $(1.5) million for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
785786_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	Derivatives: The Company periodically enters into derivative contracts such as foreign currency forwards and interest rate swaps, which are designated as cash flow hedges.
785786_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value.
785786_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability (a fair value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge), or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.
785786_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
785786_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability.
785786_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
785786_12_ITEM15_P34_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity.
785786_12_ITEM15_P34_S3	The Company's interest rate swaps and forward contracts are treated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, $6.8 million , $(0.4) million and $2.0 million were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
785786_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Grants from Government Authorities: Grants from governments are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant funds will be received and the Company will comply with all attached conditions to the grant.
785786_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are recorded as an offset to the carrying value of the related assets at the time of capitalization.
785786_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	Government grants relating to other costs incurred are recognized as an offset to those related costs, for which the grants are intended to compensate for, at the time they are recognized.
785786_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Earnings Per Share: The computation of basic earnings per common share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and net income.
785786_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	The computation of diluted earnings per common share reflects additional dilution from stock options and restricted stock, excluding any with an antidilutive effect.
785786_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	Stock-based Compensation: The Company measures all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, at fair value and expenses them in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company follows the established standards for reporting comprehensive income, which is defined as the changes in equity of an enterprise except those resulting from shareholder transactions.
785786_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	Accumulated other comprehensive income consists of the following as of September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 (in thousands):
785786_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company recognizes a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement.
785786_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	The liability is adjusted for any additions or deletions of related property, plant and equipment.
785786_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
785786_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
785786_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments: Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at cost because of the short-term duration of these instruments.
785786_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	Accounts receivable are reflected at net realizable value based on anticipated losses due to potentially uncollectible balances.
785786_12_ITEM15_P41_S2	Anticipated losses were based on management s analysis of historical losses and changes in customers credit status.
785786_12_ITEM15_P41_S3	The fair value of capital lease obligations was approximately $13.7 million and $15.8 million as of September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 , respectively.
785786_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	the Company s long-term debt was $256.8 million and $274.3 million as of September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 , respectively.
785786_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	The Company uses quoted market prices when available or discounted cash flows to calculate fair value.
785786_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt and capital lease obligations (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described below.

785786_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.
785786_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	The input levels are: Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
785786_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
785786_12_ITEM15_P46_S3	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.
785786_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Business and Credit Concentrations: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and derivative instruments, specifically related to counterparties.

785786_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rates reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 :

785786_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	The increase to the income tax expense recorded in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 is the result of the Company recording an additional valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets based on the significant negative evidence of the Company's U.S. cumulative loss position and the deterioration of its forecasts late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for fiscal 2013, which has impacted forecasted profitability in the near term in the AMER region.
785786_12_ITEM15_P82_S2	Plexus believes the cumulative losses for the previous three fiscal years are a significant factor in establishing such an allowance coupled with the lesser weight of evidence pertaining to longer range forecasts.
785786_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	As the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is proportionate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified, it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objectively verifiable negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses.
785786_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	Accordingly, the Company, based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, established an additional valuation allowance of $20.6 million ( $22.8 million provision, offset by $2.2 million to other comprehensive income) on the U.S deferred tax assets as of September 29, 2012.

785786_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	In addition, during fiscal 2012 the Company added valuation allowances of $0.9 million and $0.4 million in Germany and Romania, respectively, to offset the increase in net deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions which, more likely than not, will not be realized.
785786_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	million and $0.2 million in the United Kingdom, respectively, and $0.9 million and $0.6 million in Romania, respectively.
785786_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	During the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012 , tax legislation was adopted in various jurisdictions.
785786_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	None of these changes are expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

785786_12_ITEM15_P87_S3	The Company does not provide for taxes that would be payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted because the Company considers these earnings to be permanently reinvested.

785786_12_ITEM15_P87_S5	If such earnings were repatriated, additional tax expense may result, although the calculation of such additional taxes is not practicable at this time.

785786_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	Approximately $6.5 million and $6.3 million , respectively of the balance as of September 29, 2012 , and October 1, 2011 would reduce the Company s effective tax rate if recognized.
785786_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
785786_12_ITEM15_P88_S2	The total accrued penalties and net accrued interest with respect to income taxes was approximately $0.9 million , $0.7 million and $0.5 million as of September 29, 2012 , October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010 , respectively.

785786_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	for fiscal years 2008 through 2010 and is not undergoing any tax examinations in any of its major foreign jurisdictions.
785786_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	The U.S. examination may be resolved within the next twelve months, but at this time it is not possible to estimate the amount of the effects of any changes to the Company's previously recorded uncertain tax positions.
785786_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	The Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, with federal, state, local and foreign taxing jurisdictions.
785786_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	The following tax years remain subject to examination by the respective major tax jurisdictions:

785786_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Plexus delivers comprehensive end-to-end solutions for customers in the Americas ( AMER ), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA ) and Asia-Pacific ( APAC ) regions.
785786_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	We provide award-winning customer service to more than 140 branded product companies in the Networking/Communications, Healthcare/Life Sciences, Industrial/Commercial and Defense/Security/Aerospace market sectors.
785786_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	Our customers have stringent quality, reliability and regulatory requirements, mandating exceptional production and supply chain agility.
785786_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	Their products require complex configuration management, direct order fulfillment (to end customers) and global logistics management and sustaining solutions.
785786_13_ITEM1_P2_S3	To service the complexities our customers' products demand, we utilize our Product Realization Value Stream, addressing our customers' products from concept to end of life -- conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and sustaining solutions.
785786_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Plexus is passionate about striving to be the leading EMS company in the world at servicing mid-to-low volume, higher complexity customer programs, characterized by unique flexibility, technology, quality and regulatory requirements.
785786_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	To support and deliver on our strategy, we align our operations, processes, workforce and financial metrics through a multidimensional business strategy that includes:
785786_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Execution through continuous evaluation and optimization of our business processes, supporting our return on invested capital ( ROIC ) goal.
785786_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	We operate flexible manufacturing facilities and processes designed to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations.
785786_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	Each of our customers is supported by a multi-disciplinary customer team.
785786_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	One or more uniquely configured focus factories, supported by a supply chain and logistics solution, are designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness to support customer fulfillment requirements.
785786_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our go-to-market strategy is tailored by business development and customer management teams dedicated to each of the four sectors we serve.
785786_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	These teams execute our sector strategies through expertise in markets and technology as well as unique quality and regulatory capabilities.
785786_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our sector teams help define Plexus' strategy for growth with a particular focus on expanding the value-added solutions we offer customers.
785786_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our financial model aligns with our business strategy.
785786_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our primary focus is to earn a return on invested capital ( ROIC ) 5% over our weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ).
785786_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; at the end of fiscal 2013 we reduced our estimated WACC from 12.0% to 11.0% for fiscal 2014 .
785786_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe economic profit is a fundamental driver of shareholder value.
785786_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	Plexus measures economic profit by taking the difference between ROIC and WACC and multiplying it by invested capital.
785786_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	By exercising discipline to generate an ROIC in excess of our WACC, with focus on economic profit, our goal is to ensure that Plexus creates value for our shareholders.
785786_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, flexibility and fulfillment requirements, as well as complex regulatory environments, typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs.
785786_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	The cost variance from our competitors is especially evident relative to those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics).
785786_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with many other technology pioneering start-ups or emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities.
785786_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	As a result of serving market sectors that rely on advanced electronics technology, our business is influenced by critical technological trends such as the level and rate of development of wired and wireless telecommunications infrastructure, communications data and data bandwidth growth, and Internet usage.
785786_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	defense procurement practices, and other government and regulatory processes.
785786_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Plexus may benefit from increasing outsourcing trends.
785786_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	We provide most of our optimized solutions on a turnkey basis, and we procure some or all materials required for product assembly.
785786_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	We provide select services on a consignment basis, meaning the customer supplies the necessary materials and Plexus provides the labor and other services required for product assembly.
785786_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	In addition to manufacturing, turnkey services require material procurement and warehousing and involve greater resource investments than consignment services.
785786_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Other than certain test equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
785786_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Established in 1979 as a Wisconsin corporation, we have approximately 9,200 full-time employees, including approximately 1,740 engineers and technologists dedicated to product development and design, test equipment development and design, and manufacturing process development and control, all of whom operate from 27 active facilities, totaling approximately 4.1 million square feet.
785786_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	Plexus' facilities are strategically located to support the global supply chain, as well as manufacturing and engineering needs of customers in our targeted market sectors.
785786_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Plexus maintains a website at www.plexus.com.
785786_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	As soon as is reasonably practical, and after we electronically file or furnish all filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), we provide online copies, free of charge.
785786_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	These reports include: Proxy Statements, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports.
785786_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics is also posted on our website.

785786_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	Tailoring our Product Realization Value Stream to each product and program, Plexus provides unique solutions designed to meet the needs of each of our customers.
785786_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	As our partnerships grow and mature, we aim to engage our customers in full utilization of our Product Realization Value Stream.
785786_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	During the product development and conceptualization phases, new product ideas are created and evaluated with both the customer's and Plexus' engineering teams.
785786_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We closely collaborate with our customers to capture their new product vision and clarify requirements.
785786_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our industrial design team attempts to analyze a product through the end user's eyes focusing on ergonomics, use case research, user interface, aesthetics and evaluation mockups.
785786_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	Upon completion of concept evaluations, the Plexus team prototypes what it believes to be the most promising designs, working concurrently with engineering, manufacturing and supply chain teams.
785786_13_ITEM1_P17_S4	Future phases ensure design intent is maintained, while realizing the final product solution.
785786_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Plexus invests in the latest technology, design and automation tools to provide comprehensive design and value-engineering solutions.
785786_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	We engage with our customers in a variety of ways - from supporting a short-term expansion of their engineering design capabilities to collaborating on complex turn-key product design.
785786_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	Our disciplined approach and structure enables significant project schedule flexibility via work-sharing across our organization.
785786_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	Product design includes, but is not limited to, the following solutions:
785786_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Test specifications development and product verification testing Plexus also provides comprehensive value-engineering solutions, extending the product life cycle.
785786_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our value-add solutions span a wide range - engineering change-order management, cost reduction redesign, component obsolescence management, product feature expansion, test enhancement and component re-sourcing.
785786_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Of all the phases in our Product Realization Value Stream, the commercialize phase carries the most influence with respect to converting ideas into viable products.
785786_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Commercialization starts early in the design phase and extends through manufacturing transition, often in tandem with Design for Excellence ( DFX ).
785786_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	Our DFX solutions encompass a wide collection of specific design solutions including design for test, design for manufacturability/assembly and design for fabrication.
785786_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	The goal of DFX is to facilitate an efficient transition from engineering to manufacturing.
785786_13_ITEM1_P21_S4	The commercialize phase also includes prototyping, new product introduction, design for supply chain, test development and transition management.
785786_13_ITEM1_P21_S5	We believe our commercialization solutions provide significant value by accelerating time-to-market, reducing change activity and providing customers with a robust and enduring product.
785786_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Plexus applies an optimized manufacturing approach, not a one-size-fits-all model.
785786_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our scalable manufacturing solutions integrate flexibility for our customers through tailored supply chain solutions.
785786_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	Our focus-factory model provides a dedicated team designed to drive success while saving time and money.
785786_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Focus-factories place the customer at the center of operations, executing within a culture of continuous improvement.
785786_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Plexus exclusively focuses on mid-to-low volume, higher-complexity programs that range from lower-level assemblies to finished electro-mechanical products.
785786_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	Our manufactured products typically fall into one of the following categories in our assembly spectrum:
785786_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	System and mechatronic integration products may run larger in size than other assemblies; the products range from kiosks to finished healthcare devices and life sciences equipment to other complex electro-mechanical assemblies.
785786_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	These products often combine other integrated solutions we provide and may require further unique facility configurations or supply chain solutions.
785786_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Plexus offers fulfillment and logistics solutions to all our customers in the forms of Direct Order Fulfillment ( DOF ), Build to Order ( BTO ) and Configure to Order ( CTO ).
785786_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	Plexus receives DOF orders from our customers that provide the final specifications required by their end customer.
785786_13_ITEM1_P25_S2	Through BTO and CTO, Plexus delivers the product directly to the end customer.
785786_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	The DOF process relies on Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) systems integrating the overall supply chain, from parts procurement through manufacturing and logistics.
785786_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Plexus provides our customers with a range of solutions support after product launch including sustaining engineering, supply chain, and manufacturing solutions.
785786_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	All Plexus manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to a baseline Quality Management System standard per ISO9001:22008.

785786_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	During fiscal 2013 , we served approximately 140 customers.
785786_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	We offer advanced design and production capabilities, allowing our customers to concentrate on their core competencies.
785786_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	Plexus helps accelerate our customers' time to market, reduce their investment in engineering and manufacturing capacity, and optimize total product cost.
785786_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Juniper Networks, Inc. ( Juniper ), which accounted for 13 percent of our net sales in fiscal 2013 , 16 percent in fiscal 2012 and 17 percent in fiscal 2011 , disengaged from Plexus in 2013, and we expect no further shipments to Juniper in fiscal 2014.
785786_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales in fiscal 2013 , 2012 or 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	The loss of any of our other major customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.
785786_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays, modifications and transitions.
785786_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers.
785786_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Customers' forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions.
785786_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations.
785786_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	In addition, as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector.
785786_13_ITEM1_P34_S3	Many of our large customers contract with us through independent multiple divisions, subsidiaries, production facilities or locations.
785786_13_ITEM1_P34_S4	We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others.
785786_13_ITEM1_P34_S5	The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 is shown in the following table:
785786_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Although our current business development focus is based on our targeted market sectors, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources geographically (see Note 12 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments).
785786_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	Plexus offers a uniform array of services for customers in each market sector and we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources to particular market sectors, nor internally track our costs and resources per market sector.
785786_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	We typically purchase raw materials, including printed circuit boards and electronic components, from manufacturers and distributors.
785786_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	Under certain circumstances, we will purchase components from brokers, customers or competitors.

785786_13_ITEM1_P54_S3	We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities.
785786_13_ITEM1_P54_S4	We believe that our employee relationships are generally positive and stable.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions and world events.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose any of these customers or if there are problems in those market sectors, our net sales and operating results could decline significantly.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 55 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2013 , and 60 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	For each of the fiscal years ended September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012 , there was one customer, Juniper, that represented 10 percent or more of our net sales.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	As previously announced, Juniper disengaged from us during fiscal 2013.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our principal customers may vary from period to period, and our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all, particularly given the volatile nature of certain programs.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Especially given our discrete number of customers, significant reductions in net sales to any of these customers, the loss of major customers or our failure to make appropriate choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S7	In addition, we focus our net sales to customers in only a few market sectors, and we endeavor to carefully choose those sectors.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Shifts in the performance of a sector served by Plexus, as well as the economic, business and/or regulatory conditions that affect the sector, or our failure to choose appropriate sectors can particularly impact Plexus.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S10	For instance, sales in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector are substantially affected by trends in the healthcare industry, such as government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the financial health of, and pending changes in the structure of, the U.S. health care sector generally, including as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Affordable Care Act").
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Further, potential reductions in U.S. defense spending, including those due to sequestration, potential government shutdown, failure to raise the debt ceiling or similar political issues, could substantially affect our opportunities in our Defense/Security/Aerospace sector.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Any weakness in the market sectors in which our customers are concentrated could affect our business and results of operations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	From time to time, our customers, including formerly significant customers, have been affected by merger and acquisition activity.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	While these transactions may present Plexus with opportunities to capture new business, they also create the risk that these customers will partially or completely disengage as a result of transitioning such business to other contract manufacturers or deciding to manufacture the products internally.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Plexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and currency risks.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We have operations in many countries; operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate now represent a majority of our revenues.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	of our operations, which are likely to increase over time, subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results:
785786_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	regulatory requirements and potential changes to those requirements.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We continue to monitor our risk associated with foreign currency translation and have entered into limited forward contracts to address this risk.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	As our international operations expand, our failure to appropriately address foreign currency transactions and/or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties, tariffs, taxes or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	For example, our facility in Juarez, Mexico operates under the Mexican Maquiladora ("IMMEX") program, and we expect that our new facility in Guadalajara, Mexico will qualify as well.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations; we could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our customers do not make long-term commitments and may cancel or change their production requirements.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	EMS companies must respond quickly to the requirements of their customers in both design and production.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Customers also cancel requirements, change engineering or other service requirements, change production quantities, delay production or revise their forecasts for a number of reasons that are beyond our control.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our working capital levels.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred and may continue to occur.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers requirements, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital management, facility requirements, personnel needs and other resource requirements.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S7	The short-term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Since many of our operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our operating results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Moreover, since our margins vary across customers and specific programs, a reduction in demand with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Rapid increases in customer requirements may stress personnel and other capacity resources.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P8_S11	We may not have sufficient resources at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have a complex business model, and our failure to properly manage that model could affect our operations and financial results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our business model focuses on products and services in the mid-to-lower-volume, higher-complexity segment of the EMS market.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our customers products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility, in some cases necessitating optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solutions across an integrated global platform.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The products we manufacture are also typically complex, highly regulated, and require complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Relative to many of our competitors that manufacture more standardized products with larger production runs, our business model requires a greater degree of attention, flexibility and resources.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	These resources include working capital, management and technical personnel, and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse manufacturing, regulatory and service requirements for multiple programs of varying sizes simultaneously, including in multiple locations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	programs online and on transitioning production for new customers and programs, which creates added complexities related to managing the start-up risks of such projects.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The complexity of our service model often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations as well as commitments from us to our customers.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If we fail to meet those obligations, it could result in claims against us and/or affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If we fail to effectively manage or execute our business model, we may lose customer confidence and our reputation may suffer.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The Company s reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to maintain or expand business opportunities could be impaired and our financial results could suffer on a going-forward basis.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs could affect our operations and financial results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new work for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to opportunities.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We must initially determine whether it would be in our interests from a business perspective to pursue a particular potential new customer or program, including evaluating the customer s and/or program s fit with our value proposition as well as its potential end-market success.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If we make the decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the anticipated costs, risks, and rewards of an opportunity.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	The failure to make prudent engagement decisions and/or to establish appropriate terms of engagement could adversely affect our profitability and margins.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Also, there are inherent risks associated with the timing and ultimate realization of a new program s anticipated revenue; these factors can sometimes extend for a significant period.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Some new programs require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and competencies; in addition, as a result of production startup costs, new programs are inherently less efficient in their earlier phases than mature programs.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We may not meet customer expectations, which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver conforming product on a timely basis.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P12_S8	Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market acceptance, regulatory approvals and/or economic conditions.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P12_S9	The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute on a new program s requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our manufacturing services involve inventory risk.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Most of our contract manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts and/or orders.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	A customer s cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Engineering changes by a customer may result in obsolete materials or components.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory and require customers to reimburse us for these items, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or be able to collect on these obligations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Excess or obsolete inventory, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	These managed inventory programs result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to the risk of enforcing those obligations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction, if any, may seriously harm our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction to adjust to customers needs and market demands.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Plexus regularly contends with these issues and must carefully manage its business to meet customer and market requirements.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Expansion, including the transfer of operations to larger facilities, can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	During fiscal 2013 , we opened a new manufacturing facility in China (Xiamen) and a replacement facility in Romania (Oradea).
785786_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we opened a new manufacturing facility in the U.S. (Neenah, Wisconsin), which is replacing two existing leased facilities and one owned facility.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Construction of the new facility is expected to be complete in the second half of fiscal 2014.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we are unable to effectively manage our currently anticipated growth, or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, we may expand our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Other risks of current or future expansion include:
785786_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the expansion.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entail short-term costs, reductions in capacity and/or employment could impair our ability to respond to market improvements or to maintain customer relationships.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	When we make decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring charges.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	In addition, to meet our customers needs, particularly when the production requirements of certain products is site-specific, or to achieve increased efficiencies, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Since customers needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P20_S7	We may also encounter situations where our lack of a physical presence in certain locations may limit or foreclose opportunities.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Changes in tax laws, potential tax disputes, negative or unforeseen tax consequences and/or further developments affecting our deferred tax assets could affect our results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Company has been granted a tax holiday for its Malaysian subsidiary.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	This tax holiday expires in 2024 and is subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply and would risk adverse tax consequences if we do not.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Given the scope of our international operations and our international tax arrangements, proposed changes to the manner in which U.S. based multinational companies are taxed in the U.S. could have a material impact on our operating results and competitiveness.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, other recently adopted or potential changes to tax laws in the other jurisdictions in which we operate could also affect our results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Plexus is eligible for up to $15 million in Wisconsin state tax credits in connection with our new manufacturing facility in Neenah, if we meet certain requirements related to, among other matters, job creation and retention, employee training and capital investment.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If we do not comply with these requirements, we may not be able to realize all, or any, of these tax credits.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As of September 28, 2013 , approximately $4.7 million has been recognized as a miscellaneous receivable related to the credits.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of an additional valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations and industry standards, and the impact of certain future regulations remains uncertain; failure to comply with such regulations and standards could have an adverse affect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are subject to extensive government regulation and industry standards relating to the products we design and manufacture as well as how we conduct our business, including regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support and many other facets of our operations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Failure or noncompliance with such regulations or standards could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	As a publicly-held company, we are subject to increasingly stringent laws, regulation and other requirements, including those resulting from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, affecting, among other areas, our accounting, internal controls, corporate governance practices, securities disclosures and reporting.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	For example, in fiscal 2013, the SEC adopted disclosure requirements related to the use of specified "conflict" minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by publicly-held companies.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Compliance with such requirements could increase costs and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly aggressive in enforcing and adopting anti-corruption laws.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, among others, apply to us and our operations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The Affordable Care Act significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the United States and is expected to impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance and/or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is subject to statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety, including Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulations and similar regulations in other countries.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Failure to comply with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of devices, or total or partial suspension of production.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We also design and manufacture products for customers in the defense and aerospace industries.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Companies that design and manufacture products for these industries face significant regulation by the Department of Defense, Department of State, Federal Aviation Authority, and other governmental agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries, and also under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In addition, whenever we pursue business in new sectors and subsectors, or our customers pursue new technologies or markets, we need to navigate the potentially heavy regulatory and legislative burdens of such sectors, technologies or markets.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	For example, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, as well as the financial health of health care providers, and pending changes in how health care in the U.S. is structured, including as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in this sector as well as impact our margins.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards, including many of the industry-specific regulations discussed above.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Our customers' failure to comply could affect their businesses, which in turn would affect our sales to them.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	In addition, if our customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs for these customers and create inefficiencies in our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	A failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, and third party certification requirements, including those related to social responsibility, could adversely affect our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own social responsibility, conflict minerals or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Such policies or standards may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third party organizations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	For example, certain of these policies or standards may relate to overseas labor and may require us to comply with standards or policies to which we would not otherwise be subject.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	As a result of customer requirements and the need to enhance our competitive position, we may seek to obtain and maintain various certifications from third parties relating to our quality systems and standards.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Our compliance with these policies, standards and third party certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	An inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, may adversely affect our business and reputation.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	As a global company with a complex business model, we heavily depend on our information systems to support our customers requirements and to successfully manage our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to system and data security, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our information systems, like those of other companies, are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, viruses, industrial espionage, break-ins and similar events, or breaches of security.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency and recovery processes.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	However, any operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers financial, product and other confidential information, result in regulatory actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If we are unable to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise, our results may be adversely affected.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The markets for our manufacturing, engineering and other services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process developments.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Our internal processes are also subject to these factors.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	The continued success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to:
785786_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, we may have to acquire new design, assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P39_S4	The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements, and our need to maintain our personnel and other resources during times of fluctuating demand, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In the current environment, our revenue growth has been heavily biased toward ramping new program wins as compared to end-market growth of mature programs.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The management of resources in connection with the establishment of new or recent programs and customer relationships, as well as program transfers between facilities, and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross and operating margins and level of working capital.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life-cycle of new products and programs, which lack a track record of order volume and timing as well as production efficiencies in the early stages.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P40_S4	We are managing a number of new programs at any given time; therefore, we are exposed to these factors in varying magnitudes.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P40_S5	In addition, if any of these programs or customer relationships were terminated, our operating results could worsen, particularly in the short term.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P40_S6	The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P40_S7	We conduct these transfers on a regular basis to meet customer needs, seek long-term efficiencies or respond to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P40_S8	Although we try to minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between Plexus facilities, there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P40_S9	While these factors tend to affect new, recent or transferred programs, they can also impact more mature, or maturing programs and customer relationships, especially programs where end-market demand can be somewhat volatile.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	There may be problems with the products we design or manufacture that could result in liability claims against us and reduced demand for our services.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The products that we design and/or manufacture may be subject to liability or claims in the event that defects are discovered or alleged.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We design and manufacture products to our customers specifications, many of which are highly complex, and produce products for industries, such as health care, defense and aerospace, that tend to have higher risk profiles.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the design and/or manufacturing of these products, including as a result of business continuity issues.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Whether or not we are responsible, problems in the products we manufacture, whether real or alleged, whether caused by faulty customer specifications, the design or manufacturing processes or a component defect, may result in delayed shipments to customers and/or reduced or canceled customer orders.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P42_S4	If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P42_S5	In addition, problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P42_S6	These potential claims may include damages for the recall of a product and/or injury to person or property.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P42_S7	Even if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P42_S8	While we seek to insure against many of these risks, insurance coverage may be inadequate, not cost effective or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products or issues.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P42_S9	We occasionally incur costs defending claims, and any such disputes could affect our business relationships.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our design and manufacturing services and the products offered by our customers involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P43_S4	In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P43_S5	We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Infringement by our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and disrupt our production.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P43_S7	Additionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P43_S8	Such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products, and could affect our customer relationships more broadly.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P43_S9	Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and components upon which we rely.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our products are for end markets that require technologically advanced products with relatively short life-cycles.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Factors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve, in particular short product life-cycles, could seriously affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Even if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business relationships with them and our production for them, can affect our production cycles, inventory management and results of operations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Increased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The EMS industry is highly competitive and has become more so as a result of economic challenges affecting the industry and the economy as a whole.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We compete against numerous EMS providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally and may choose to manufacture products themselves rather than outsource that process.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Consolidations and other changes in the EMS industry result in a changing competitive landscape.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Some of our competitors have a larger geographic footprint than we do, in addition to substantially greater managerial, manufacturing, engineering, technical, financial, systems, sales and marketing resources than ourselves.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	be better positioned to compete on price for their services.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We may operate at a cost disadvantage compared to other EMS providers that have lower internal cost structures or greater direct buying power with component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or become increasingly competitive.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or loss of market share.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P50_S4	We may experience raw material and component shortages and price fluctuations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P50_S5	We do not have any long-term supply agreements.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P50_S6	At various times we have experienced raw material and component shortages due to supplier capacity constraints or their failure to deliver.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P50_S7	Periodic shortages may occur in the future.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P50_S8	Such constraints can also be caused by world events, such as government policies, terrorism, armed conflict, natural disasters, economic recession and other localized events.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used in the assembly process and, in some cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular raw material or component.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Such suppliers may encounter quality problems, labor disputes, financial difficulties or business continuity issues that could preclude them from delivering raw materials or components timely or at all.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Some suppliers have ceased doing business due to economic or other circumstances, and more may do so in the future.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Supply shortages and delays in deliveries of raw materials or components have in some cases resulted in delayed production of assemblies, which have increased our inventory levels and adversely affected our operating results in certain periods.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S4	An inability to obtain sufficient inventory on a timely basis could also harm relationships with our customers.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S5	In addition, raw materials and components that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S6	Certain materials provided to us may be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S7	The need to obtain replacement materials and parts may negatively affect our manufacturing operations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S8	The inadvertent use of any such parts or products may also give rise to liability claims.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S9	Raw material and component supply shortages and delays in deliveries can also result in increased pricing.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S10	While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in raw material or component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S11	Conversely, as a result of our pricing strategies and practices, raw material and component price reductions have contributed positively to our operating results in the past.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S12	Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S13	We depend on our workforce, including certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel or other personnel disruptions, including the inability to hire and retain sufficient personnel, may harm our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S14	Our success depends in large part on the continued services of our key technical and management personnel, and on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, particularly highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of products.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S15	The competition for these individuals is significant, and the loss of key employees could harm our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S16	From time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, disability, death and other terminations of service that affect our executive officers and other key employees.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P51_S17	Transitions of responsibilities among officers and key employees, particularly those that are unplanned, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, which could have an effect on our results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We also depend on good relationships with our workforce generally.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Any disruption in our relationships with our personnel, including as a result of potential union organizing activities, work actions or other labor issues, could substantially affect our operations and results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	In addition, when we expand operations in either existing areas or new locations, including internationally, we need to attract and retain the services of sufficient qualified personnel to conduct those operations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P52_S3	If we fail to retain and maintain sufficient qualified personnel, the operations at those locations, and consequently our financial results, could be adversely affected.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	new or existing facilities we may be subject to local labor practices or union activities, wage pressure and changing wage requirements, increasing health care costs, differing employment laws and regulations in various countries, local competition for employees as well as high turnover, and other issues affecting our workforce, all of which could affect operations at particular locations, which also could have adverse effects on our operational results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Natural disasters, breaches of security and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis and floods.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	All facilities are subject to other natural or man-made disasters such as those related to global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism, breaches of security, theft or espionage, and failures of utilities.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	If such an event was to occur, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P54_S5	In addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P54_S6	If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P54_S7	Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and thus negatively affect our relationships and financial results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P54_S8	Although we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to physical security, we remain at risk of unauthorized access to our facilities and the possible unauthorized use or theft of inventory, information or other physical assets.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P54_S9	If unauthorized persons gain physical access to our facilities, or our physical assets or information are stolen or used in an unauthorized manner (whether through outside theft or industrial espionage), we could be subject to, among other consequences, negative publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, loss of government contracts, litigation by affected parties and/or other future financial obligations related to the loss, misuse or theft of our or our customers' data, inventory or physical assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We have increased our borrowings, and we may fail to secure or maintain necessary financing.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We have increased our borrowings in recent years.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	However, we cannot be certain that our existing credit facilities will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P55_S3	In addition, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit agreement and our interest rate swap agreements, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations, either due to instability in the global financial markets or otherwise.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P55_S5	We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining new credit facilities or a combination of these methods.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P55_S6	We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P55_S7	If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders ownership interests.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P55_S8	Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions, as well as strategic arrangements, and may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or recognize the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We have previously grown, in part, through acquisitions and strategic arrangements.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	If we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions, this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	the loss of key employees of acquired businesses.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	the unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Our stock price has fluctuated significantly in recent periods.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P60_S2	The price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors relating to us, our competitors and the market for our services, many of which are beyond our control.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P60_S3	In addition, the stock market in general, and share prices for technology companies in particular, have from time to time experienced extreme volatility, including weakness, that sometimes has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P60_S4	These broad market and industry fluctuations, and concerns affecting the economy generally, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating results.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P60_S5	Among other things, volatility and weakness in our stock price could mean that investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices that they paid.
785786_13_ITEM1A_P60_S6	Volatility and weakness could also impair our ability in the future to offer common stock or convertible securities as a source of additional capital and/or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses.
785786_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facilities comprise an integrated network of engineering and manufacturing centers with our corporate headquarters located in Neenah, Wisconsin.
785786_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own or lease facilities with approximately 3.9 million square feet of capacity.
785786_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	This includes approximately 2.1 million square feet in the Americas region ( AMER ) (of which 0.3 million square feet will close in fiscal 2014), approximately 1.4 million square feet in the Asia-Pacific region ( APAC ) and approximately 0.4 million square feet in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region ( EMEA ).
785786_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	Approximately 0.2 million square feet of this capacity is subleased.
785786_13_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our facilities as of September 28, 2013 , are described in the following table:
785786_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) Includes more than one building.
785786_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	(2) Construction of the Company's new facility in Neenah, Wisconsin was completed in fiscal 2013.
785786_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	This facility will replace one of the two facilities owned by the Company in Appleton, Wisconsin (67,000 square feet) and two facilities leased by the Company in Neenah, Wisconsin (comprising a total of 277,000 square feet).
785786_13_ITEM2_P1_S3	Consolidation of these three facilities into the new facility is expected to be complete in the first half of fiscal 2014.
785786_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	(3) This facility opened in fiscal 2013 and replaced the previously leased buildings.
785786_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	(4) Lease runs through August 2014.
785786_13_ITEM2_P2_S2	The Company will exit the lease upon its expiration and complete the transition into the new facility owned by the Company in Neenah, Wisconsin in fiscal 2014.
785786_13_ITEM2_P2_S3	(5) Lease for the office portion of the facility runs through April 2014.
785786_13_ITEM2_P2_S4	(6) Lease for a combined manufacturing and engineering facility was signed in February 2013 and runs through February 2018.
785786_13_ITEM2_P2_S5	(7) This building is subleased and no longer used in operations.
785786_13_ITEM2_P2_S6	In fiscal 2013, the Company did not renew the lease for its prior warehouse in Neenah, Wisconsin (39,000 square feet).
785786_13_ITEM2_P2_S7	Construction of a new 265,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Guadalajara, Mexico began in late fiscal 2013 and is expected to be completed during the second half of fiscal 2014.
785786_13_ITEM2_P2_S8	The Company entered into an agreement to lease the Guadalajara facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 that runs through fiscal 2024.
785786_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is party to certain lawsuits and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
785786_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management does not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

785786_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	We have not paid any cash dividends in the past.
785786_13_ITEM5_P2_S2	We currently anticipate that the majority of earnings in the foreseeable future will be retained to finance the development of our business and our authorized share repurchase.
785786_13_ITEM5_P2_S3	However, the Company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include additional share repurchases, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_13_ITEM5_P2_S4	See also Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources , for a discussion of the Company s intentions regarding dividends, and loan covenants which could restrict dividend payments.

785786_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	* On October 23, 2012, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $50 million of its common stock.
785786_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	This program was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 .
785786_13_ITEM5_P4_S2	During fiscal 2013 , the Company repurchased 1,821,698 shares under this program for approximately $49.9 million , at an average price of $27.37 per share.
785786_13_ITEM5_P4_S3	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	On August 19, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $30 million of its common stock in fiscal 2014.
785786_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	Accordingly, since this program began subsequent to September 28, 2013 , and no shares were purchased under this authorization in fiscal 2013, the $30 million is excluded from the table above.
785786_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) In fiscal 2012, we established a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets resulting in an additional tax provision of approximately $20.6 million ($22.8 million provision, offset by $2.2 million to other comprehensive income) and a decrease in diluted earnings per share of $0.64.
785786_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	Return on invested capital excludes the $20.6 million net deferred tax asset reduction.
785786_13_ITEM6_P0_S2	An additional $1.3 million of valuation allowance established for fiscal 2012 relates to operating losses in Germany and Romania making the total valuation allowance for the year $24.1 million.
785786_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	In fiscal 2009, we recorded goodwill impairment charges related to our United Kingdom operations of $5.7 million.
785786_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	In addition, we recorded pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $2.8 million which related primarily to the reduction of workforce in the United States and Mexico as well as fixed assets written down related to the closure of our Ayer, Massachusetts ("Ayer") facility.
785786_13_ITEM6_P1_S2	A favorable tax adjustment of approximately $1.4 million, primarily related to the conclusion of federal and state audits, was also recorded.
785786_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	(3) The Company defines return on invested capital as tax-effected annualized operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period.

785786_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	The following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A herein.
785786_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	As previously disclosed, in fiscal 2013, Juniper Networks, Inc. ("Juniper") disengaged from Plexus.
785786_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Production for Juniper concluded at the end of our third fiscal quarter of 2013 and sales of inventory concluded in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2013.
785786_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	We incurred approximately $0.6 million of severance and asset impairment costs in connection with the disengagement in the third quarter of fiscal 2013; no further related costs are expected.
785786_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	Sales to Juniper were 13% of our net sales in fiscal 2013 as compared to 16% in fiscal 2012, and were from the Company's AMER and APAC segments.
785786_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	We expect no further shipments to Juniper in fiscal 2014.
785786_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our new Neenah, Wisconsin manufacturing facility, which will replace one owned and two leased facilities, opened in the fiscal first quarter of 2014.
785786_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Consolidation of the three other facilities into our new facility is expected to result in approximately $3.0 to $4.0 million of restructuring charges in the first half of fiscal 2014.
785786_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 (dollars in millions, except per share data):
785786_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2013 decreased $78.7 million , or 3.4 percent , as compared to fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	The net sales decrease was primarily the result of a $113.6 million decrease in net sales for one of our larger customers in the industrial/commercial sector, as a result of its decreased end-market demand, as well as an $85.3 million decrease in net sales to Juniper, as a result of its disengagement and lower end-market demand for the products we produced for Juniper.
785786_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	These decreases were partially offset by a $102.4 million increase in net sales to various significant customers in all sectors.
785786_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	Net sales for fiscal 2012 increased $75.5 million , or 3.4 percent , as compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P7_S4	The net sales increase resulted from higher net sales in all of our market sectors, except for a decrease in the networking/communications sector.
785786_13_ITEM7_P7_S5	The net sales increase primarily related to the continued ramp of production for a significant industrial/commercial sector customer and $81.9 million of incremental revenue from the strategic arrangement with Kontron (the "Kontron arrangement"), as well as program ramps from several other existing customers.
785786_13_ITEM7_P7_S6	These increases in net sales were partially offset by decreased sales in the networking/communications sector due to lower end-market demand and two customer disengagements as a result of the acquisition of such customers by other companies.
785786_13_ITEM7_P7_S7	Our net sales by market sector for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were as follows (in millions):
785786_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net sales for the networking/communications sector decreased $77.3 million for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	The change was primarily the result of an $85.3 million decrease in net sales to Juniper, related to its disengagement, partially offset by increased sales to existing customers in this sector as well as program ramps with new customers.
785786_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Net sales for the networking/communications sector decreased $126.3 million for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	The decline in the sector was primarily the result of the $74.9 million impact from the fiscal 2011 disengagement of two significant customers noted above and overall unfavorable end-market trends reflecting global economic uncertainty.
785786_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net sales to Juniper in fiscal 2012 did not change significantly from fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Net sales for the industrial/commercial sector decreased $119.8 million for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	The decrease was primarily a result of decreased end-market demand for one of our larger customers in the sector, which accounted for $113.6 million of the decreased net sales as compared to the prior year.
785786_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	Net sales for the industrial/commercial sector increased $142.8 million for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	The increase was primarily attributable to the continued ramp of a significant customer and $81.9 million of incremental revenue related to the Kontron arrangement, as well as the addition of a new customer in this sector.
785786_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Net sales for the healthcare/life sciences sector increased $68.8 million for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase was primarily due to market share gains and new program ramps with existing customers.
785786_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	Net sales for the healthcare/life sciences sector increased $24.2 million for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	The increase was primarily due to market share gain and new programs with existing customers.
785786_13_ITEM7_P10_S4	Net sales for the defense/security/aerospace sector increased $49.6 million for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P10_S5	The increase was the result of new program ramps as well as increased end-market demand for the products we produce for our customers.
785786_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Net sales for the defense/security/aerospace sector increased $34.8 million for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	The increase was primarily due to stronger end-market demand in the aerospace market as well as the addition of a new customer in this sector.
785786_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	The percentages of net sales to customers representing 10 percent or more of net sales and net sales to our ten largest customers for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were as follows:
785786_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Juniper disengaged from Plexus in fiscal 2013 and we expect no further shipments to Juniper in fiscal 2014.
785786_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	For fiscal 2013 , gross profit decreased $6.7 million , or 3.1% , compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to decreased net sales, increased fixed expenses related to site expansions in Penang, Malaysia, Xiamen, China and Oradea, Romania and unfavorable changes in customer mix.
785786_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The decrease was partially offset by the sale of certain inventory that had previously been written down.
785786_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	A slightly larger percentage decrease in revenue as compared to the decrease in gross profit for fiscal 2013 led to an increase in gross margin to 9.6 percent for fiscal 2013 from 9.5 percent for fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	For fiscal 2012 , gross profit increased $5.2 million compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the net sales increase.
785786_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase was partially offset by increased fixed expenses related to higher headcount to support the revenue growth, costs related to the addition of a fourth facility in Penang, Malaysia of approximately $5.9 million, transition costs due to the Kontron arrangement, and an unfavorable change in customer mix.
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Customer mix negatively impacted gross profit due to a higher portion of sales from new programs, which tend to be inherently less profitable during early production stages than mature programs.
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Gross profit was also negatively impacted by escalated pricing pressure, particularly in our networking/communications sector.
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	These factors led to the reduction in gross margin to 9.5 percent for fiscal 2012 from 9.6 percent for fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	For fiscal 2013 , operating income decreased $7.5 million compared to fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	The operating income decrease reflected the $6.7 million decrease in gross profit described above as well as a $0.8 million increase in selling and administrative expenses ( S A ).
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	The dollar increase in S A was primarily due to approximately $2.4 million of recoveries of receivables previously at risk in the prior fiscal year, with no such recovery in the current fiscal year, and approximately $0.8 million of additional amortization expense in fiscal 2013 related to the Kontron arrangement.
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and additional reductions due to focused cost management efforts.
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S7	As a result of the factors discussed above, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 , operating margin decreased from 4.5 percent to 4.3 percent .
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S8	For fiscal 2012 , operating income increased $3.0 million compared to fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S9	The operating income increase reflected the $5.2 million increase in gross profit described above, partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in S A.
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S10	The dollar increase in S A was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, $1.3 million of amortization expense resulting from an intangible asset related to the Kontron arrangement and an increase in other personnel expenses.
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S11	These increases were partially offset by approximately $2.4 million of recoveries of receivables previously at risk.
785786_13_ITEM7_P16_S12	As a result of the factors discussed above, for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, operating margin remained at 4.5 percent .
785786_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Other expense decreased to $11.6 million for fiscal 2013 from $12.9 million for fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The decrease in expense was largely due to $3.4 million of decreased interest expense related to our term loan.
785786_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	Interest rate swaps associated with the original term loan expired in fiscal 2013.
785786_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	This resulted in lower floating interest rates prior to the establishment of a new interest rate swap agreement and lower fixed interest rates subsequent to the establishment of the new interest rate swap agreement.
785786_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	This decrease was offset by a $1.4 million increase in foreign exchange losses and a $0.8 million increase in other expense as the result of an accrual for property-related expenses related to the termination of an agreement for additional land in Hangzhou, China.
785786_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	Other expense increased to $12.9 million for fiscal 2012 from $9.1 million for fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P17_S6	The increase in expense was largely due to $4.4 million of increased interest expense primarily related to the $175 million of borrowings under the Note Purchase Agreement that the Company entered into during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below.
785786_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Income taxes and effective annual income tax rates, with and without the annual valuation allowance, for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	*The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation of income tax expense and effective annual tax rate excluding the impact of the valuation allowance provides a more accurate representation and allows for a more meaningful comparison of reporting periods.
785786_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Income tax expense for fiscal 2013 was $2.7 million compared to $29.1 million for fiscal 2012 and $2.8 million for fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	The Company's effective annual tax rates primarily vary from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent as a result of the mix of earnings from U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and tax holidays granted to our subsidiaries in China and Malaysia, where we derive a significant portion of our earnings.
785786_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 is significantly lower than the effective rate for fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of the additional valuation allowance recorded in fiscal 2012 on deferred tax assets in the U.S. and discrete tax benefits recorded in 2013 , which are further discussed below.
785786_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	During the preparation of the fiscal 2012 consolidated financial statements, the Company performed an analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, regarding the need for a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets, consistent with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
785786_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Accordingly, as of September 29, 2012 , the Company established an additional valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets, impacting the tax provision by $22.8 million.
785786_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	The additional $1.3 million of the $24.1 million valuation allowance shown above for fiscal 2012 relates to operating losses in Germany and Romania.
785786_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	The Company continues to assess the need to maintain the valuation allowance established on the U.S. deferred tax assets.
785786_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	At the close of fiscal 2013 , using the measurement criteria found in ASC Topic 740, the Company believes that the positive evidence does not outweigh the negative and the valuation allowance should remain in place.
785786_13_ITEM7_P21_S5	In fiscal 2013 the Company recorded an additional valuation allowance of $7.0 million for the full year.
785786_13_ITEM7_P21_S6	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 , the Company identified and recorded a discrete tax adjustment placing a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our U.K. operations, which increased tax expense by $1.8 million ($0.05 per diluted share).
785786_13_ITEM7_P21_S7	Our analysis found that in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 , the U.K. operations experienced an unanticipated material decline in sales resulting in a loss in fiscal 2013 ; losses are forecasted to continue into fiscal 2014 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P21_S8	While we expect our U.K. operations to regain profitability, the current, forecasted and cumulative losses are substantial negative evidence.
785786_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	The remaining $5.2 million of the $7.0 million valuation allowance shown above for fiscal 2013 relates to operating losses, primarily in the U.S., Germany and Romania.
785786_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Having examined the evidence, both positive and negative, it was determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be utilized and should have a valuation allowance placed against them.
785786_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the Company identified and recorded several out-of-period tax errors that reduced tax expense by $3.2 million ($0.09 per diluted share).
785786_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Company believes these out-of-period tax errors were not material to the fiscal 2013 , or previously issued, financial statements.
785786_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	We currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 to be approximately 8 to 10 percent.
785786_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	The Company has been granted tax holidays for its Malaysian and Xiamen, China subsidiaries.
785786_13_ITEM7_P23_S4	These tax holidays expire in fiscal 2024 and 2014 , respectively, and are subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply.
785786_13_ITEM7_P23_S5	The expiration of the tax holiday in China is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate or on the results of operations.
785786_13_ITEM7_P23_S6	However, we cannot provide any assurances as to the effect and will continue to monitor the projected impact.
785786_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	In fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , these subsidiaries generated income, which resulted in tax reductions of approximately $22.7 million ($0.66 per basic share), $17.5 million ($0.50 per basic share) and $21.7 million ($0.57 per basic share), respectively.
785786_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Net income, with and without the annual valuation allowance and out-of-period tax adjustments, for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	*The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation of net income excluding valuation allowances and out-of-period tax adjustments provides a more meaningful comparison of reporting periods.
785786_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Net income for fiscal 2013 increased by $20.2 million , or 32.5 percent , to $82.3 million from fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	This increase was primarily as a result of the net $17.1 million year-over-year valuation allowance adjustment.
785786_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	Excluding the valuation allowance and fourth quarter tax out-of-period adjustments, fiscal 2013 net income decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.1 percent, from fiscal 2012 to $86.1 million.
785786_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	Primarily as a result of the $24.1 million valuation allowance adjustment, net income for fiscal 2012 decreased by $27.2 million , or 30.4 percent , to $62.1 million from fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	Excluding the valuation allowance adjustment, net income was $86.2 million, a decrease of $4.3 million, or 4.8 percent from fiscal 2011 as a result of higher fixed expenses and increased interest expense, partially offset by the effect of higher net sales.
785786_13_ITEM7_P26_S5	Diluted earnings per share, with and without the annual valuation allowance and out-of-period tax adjustments, for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was as follows:
785786_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	*The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share excluding valuation allowances and out-of-period tax adjustments provides a more meaningful comparison of reporting periods.
785786_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.36 for fiscal 2013 from $1.75 for fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of the impact of the valuation allowances and fourth quarter out-of-period tax adjustments discussed above.
785786_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Excluding the impact of the valuation allowances and out-of-period tax adjustments, diluted earnings per share increased by $0.04 in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	The increase in diluted earnings per share, as adjusted was primarily due to the positive impact of fewer outstanding shares in 2013 due to the stock repurchase program.
785786_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	Diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.75 for fiscal 2012 from $2.30 for fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the valuation allowance adjustment discussed above.
785786_13_ITEM7_P28_S4	Excluding the $0.68 per share impact of the valuation allowance adjustment, diluted earnings per share increased to $2.43 for fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P28_S5	The increase in diluted earnings per share excluding the valuation allowance adjustment was primarily due to the effect of a decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchases completed late in fiscal 2011 , partially offset by lower net income.
785786_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Return on Invested Capital ( ROIC ).
785786_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	We use a 5-5 financial model which is aligned with our business strategy, and includes a ROIC goal of 5% over our weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ) and a 5% operating margin target.
785786_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	Our primary focus is our ROIC goal, which is designed to create shareholder value and generate enough cash to self-fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of 15%.
785786_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	For fiscal 2014 and forward, we have reduced our targeted organic revenue growth rate to 12% to reflect opportunities in the markets we serve.
785786_13_ITEM7_P29_S4	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; at the end of fiscal 2013 we reduced our estimated WACC from 12.0% to 11.0% for fiscal 2014.
785786_13_ITEM7_P29_S5	By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders.
785786_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	ROIC was 14.0% , 15.5% (excluding $20.6 million net deferred tax asset reduction) and 15.6% for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
785786_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	The decrease in ROIC in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 was due to lower operating income and an increase in average invested capital as a result of capital expenditures for facility expansions.
785786_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	See the table below for our calculation of ROIC (dollars in millions):
785786_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	We define ROIC as tax-effected annualized operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period for the fiscal year.
785786_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents.
785786_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way.
785786_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure which should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
785786_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance.
785786_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	In particular, we provide ROIC because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view ROIC as an important measure in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital requirements.
785786_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	We also use a derivative measure of ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation.
785786_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	For a reconciliation of ROIC to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
785786_13_ITEM7_P33_S4	REPORTABLE SEGMENTS A further discussion of our fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 financial performance by reportable segment is presented below (in millions):
785786_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2013 decreased $193.1 million , or 15.4 percent , from fiscal 2012 , due primarily to $113.6 million of decreased sales resulting from lower end-market demand from a significant industrial/commercial sector customer as well as a $71.1 million decrease in net sales due to a drop in demand from Juniper related to its disengagement and lower end-market demand for the products we produced for Juniper.
785786_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Operating income for fiscal 2013 decreased $20.2 million from fiscal 2012 due primarily to the decrease in net sales.
785786_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2012 decreased $49.0 million , or 3.8 percent , from fiscal 2011 , primarily as a result of decreased end-market demand in the networking/communications sector, which included the loss of two significant networking/communications customers, one as a result of a customer disengagement and the other as a result of a drop in end-market demand for the mix of products we produced for that customer.
785786_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	These decreases were partially offset by the ramp of production for a significant industrial/commercial sector customer and the addition of a new customer in this sector as well.
785786_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Net sales to Juniper in fiscal 2012 did not change significantly from fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Operating income for fiscal 2012 increased $22.4 million from fiscal 2011 due to a favorable customer mix, an increase in engineering design and services profitability of approximately $5.1 million and $2.4 million of recoveries of receivables previously at risk.
785786_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2013 increased $35.9 million , or 3.2 percent , from fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase in net sales was primarily experienced in the healthcare/life sciences sector as a result of new program wins which more than offset the $14.2 million decrease in sales to Juniper as a result of its disengagement.
785786_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	Operating income increased $14.4 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 , primarily as a result of the increase in net sales and favorable changes in customer mix combined with higher costs incurred in fiscal 2012 related to facility expansion and the Kontron arrangement.
785786_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	Net sales for fiscal 2012 increased $47.3 million , or 4.4 percent , from fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P36_S4	This growth reflected incremental revenue from the Kontron arrangement of approximately $81.9 million as well as higher net sales to multiple customers across our market sectors.
785786_13_ITEM7_P36_S5	These increases were partially offset by decreased net sales from the disengagement of one customer in the networking/communications sector and a decline in end-market demand for the mix of products we produce for another customer in this sector as well for an industrial/commercial sector customer.
785786_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Operating income decreased $16.2 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 , primarily as a result of costs related to the addition of a fourth facility in Penang, Malaysia of approximately $5.9 million, increased expenses related to higher headcount to support capacity investments, transition costs for the Kontron arrangement and escalated pricing pressure.
785786_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) : Net sales for fiscal 2013 increased $27.1 million , or 28.4 percent , from fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	The increase in net sales was driven primarily by approximately $22.0 million from the ramp of new customers in each of our market sectors, partially offset by decreased net sales of $8.5 million due to the disengagement of an industrial/commercial customer.
785786_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Operating loss increased in the current year as compared to the prior year due to an increase in fixed costs associated with the new facility in Oradea, Romania and the ramping of new customers at the United Kingdom facility.
785786_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	An increase in labor and parts costs in the fourth quarter of 2013 also contributed to the increased operating loss.
785786_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2012 increased $3.2 million , or 3.5 percent , from fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	The increase in net sales was driven primarily by the addition of new customers in each of our market sectors, partially offset by decreased net sales to an industrial/commercial customer as a result of reduced end-market demand for the mix of products we produce for that customer.
785786_13_ITEM7_P39_S4	Operating results improved in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to increased profitability in Romania based on the mix of customers and increased leverage at the facility.
785786_13_ITEM7_P39_S5	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents were $341.9 million as of September 28, 2013 compared to $297.6 million as of September 29, 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P39_S6	The increase in the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to cash generated from operations, partially offset by purchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program as well as increased capital expenditures for footprint expansions.
785786_13_ITEM7_P39_S7	As of September 28, 2013 , approximately 87% of our cash balance was held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries.
785786_13_ITEM7_P39_S8	Certain foreign countries impose taxes and overall penalties on transfers of cash; however, our intent is to permanently reinvest funds held in these countries.
785786_13_ITEM7_P39_S9	If this cash were remitted to the U.S., additional tax obligations may result that would reduce the amount of cash ultimately available to us in the U.S.
785786_13_ITEM7_P39_S10	Currently, we believe that cash held in the U.S., together with cash available under U.S. credit facilities and cash from foreign subsidiaries that could be remitted to the U.S. without tax consequences, will be sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.
785786_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	The table below shows a summary of cash flows for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 (in millions):
785786_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $207.6 million for fiscal 2013 , as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $157.5 million for fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	Cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to overall improved working capital management as discussed below.
785786_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $157.5 million for fiscal 2012 , as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $158.5 million for fiscal 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased slightly due to lower net income, partially offset by overall improved working capital management.
785786_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table shows a summary of cash cycle days for the periods indicated (in days):
785786_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	We calculate days in accounts receivable as accounts receivable for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	We calculate days in inventory, accounts payable, and cash deposits as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	Days in accounts receivable for the three months ended September 28, 2013 remained consistent compared to the three months ended September 29, 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	Days in inventory for the three months ended September 28, 2013 decreased by six days compared to the three months ended September 29, 2012 , due to a decrease in year-end inventory balances resulting primarily from shipments to Juniper as a consequence of its disengagement.
785786_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	Days in accounts payable for the three months ended September 28, 2013 decreased by two days compared to the three months ended September 29, 2012 , primarily due to the timing of the purchases during the quarter.
785786_13_ITEM7_P43_S5	Days in cash deposits for the three months ended September 28, 2013 increased by six days compared to the three months ended September 29, 2012 primarily due to cash deposits received from Juniper as a result of its disengagement.
785786_13_ITEM7_P43_S6	As of September 28, 2013 , the Company held $11.0 million in inventory deposits and $15.3 million in accounts receivable deposits from Juniper.
785786_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	We calculate cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits.
785786_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	As of September 28, 2013 cash cycle days decreased by ten days compared to September 29, 2012 due to the factors noted above.
785786_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Free cash flow ( FCF ), which we define as cash flow provided by (used in) operations less capital expenditures, increased for fiscal 2013 , to $99.5 million , as compared to FCF of $93.8 million for fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Although operating income decreased in fiscal 2013 , the decrease was more than offset by reduced working capital, as evidenced by the ten day decrease in cash cycle days, as described above, which led to higher FCF.
785786_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	Non-GAAP financial measures, including FCF, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance.
785786_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	In particular, we provide FCF because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions.
785786_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	We view FCF as an important financial metric as it demonstrates our ability to generate cash and allows us to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.
785786_13_ITEM7_P45_S5	FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure which should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
785786_13_ITEM7_P45_S6	For a reconciliation of FCF to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see below (in millions):
785786_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $107.2 million for fiscal 2013 as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $92.2 million for fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Cash flows used in investing activities increased primarily due to the additional investments in footprint expansions partially offset by the prior period including the Kontron arrangement.
785786_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	the expenditure of $34.2 million of cash related to the Kontron arrangement in fiscal 2012 (see Note 2 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Kontron arrangement).
785786_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	We utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal 2013 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	We currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 will be approximately $75 million.
785786_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	A portion of the fiscal 2014 capital expenditures are anticipated to be used for leasehold improvements for a new leased manufacturing facility in Guadalajara, Mexico.
785786_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	We believe the estimated capital expenditures will continue to be funded from operations, and may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, if required.
785786_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $57.4 million for fiscal 2013 , as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $10.8 million for fiscal 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Cash flows used in financing activities for fiscal 2013 were comprised primarily of $49.9 million of purchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program as well as payments on debt and capital leases.
785786_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	Cash flows used in financing activities for fiscal 2012 were comprised primarily of payments on debt, partially offset by debt proceeds and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
785786_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	On February 16, 2011 the Company s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorized the Company to repurchase up to $200 million of common stock.
785786_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	On August 15, 2011, the Company completed its share repurchase program with a total of 6.3 million shares purchased for approximately 200.0 million , at an average price of $31.69 per share.
785786_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	On October 23, 2012, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $50 million of its common stock.
785786_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	This program was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	During fiscal 2013, the Company repurchased 1,821,698 shares under this program for approximately $49.9 million , at an average price of $27.37 per share.
785786_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	On August 19, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $30 million of its common stock in fiscal 2014.
785786_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	Accordingly, no shares were purchased under this authorization in fiscal 2013.
785786_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	On May 15, 2012, the Company entered into a five-year, $250 million senior unsecured credit facility that terminates on May 15, 2017 (the Credit Facility ).
785786_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	The Credit Facility includes a $160 million revolving credit facility and a $90 million term loan.
785786_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	The revolving credit facility potentially may be increased by $100 million (the "increase option") to $260 million generally by mutual agreement of the Company, the lenders, the letter of credit issuers and the administrative agent named in the related credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), subject to certain customary conditions.
785786_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	Quarterly principal repayments of the Credit Facility term loan of $3.75 million per quarter ended on March 28, 2013.
785786_13_ITEM7_P53_S4	The final $75 million payment is due on May 15, 2017.
785786_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	The financial covenants (as defined under the Credit Facility) require that the Company maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
785786_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	As of September 28, 2013 , the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility.
785786_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Facility, at the Company's option, bear interest at a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the Company's leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement.
785786_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	Rates would increase upon negative changes in specified Company financial metrics and would decrease upon reduction in the current total leverage ratio, to no less than LIBOR plus 1.00% or base rate plus 0%.
785786_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	We are also required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused revolver credit commitment based on our leverage ratio; as of September 28, 2013 , the fee was 0.20%.
785786_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	On April 4, 2013, the original interest rate swaps associated with our term loan expired, and on June 4, 2013, the Company entered into a new interest rate swap associated with the term loan which extends through May 5, 2017.
785786_13_ITEM7_P55_S4	As of September 28, 2013 , all outstanding debt under the Credit Facility is at a fixed interest rate as a result of a fixed interest rate swap contract.
785786_13_ITEM7_P55_S5	There is no floating rate debt outstanding under the Credit Facility as of September 28, 2013 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Company also has outstanding 5.20% Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2018 (the "Notes"); $175 million principal of the Notes was outstanding as of both September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012 .
785786_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	The related Note Purchase Agreement contains certain financial covenants, which include a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth test, all as defined in the agreements.
785786_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	As of September 28, 2013 , we were in compliance with all such covenants relating to the Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement, which are consistent with those in the Credit Agreement discussed above.
785786_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Credit Facility and Note Purchase Agreement allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the future repurchases of shares provided that no event of default (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases.
785786_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	We have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not currently anticipate paying them in the future.
785786_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	However, we evaluate from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases above those already authorized, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, potential borrowings under the Credit Facility, and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.
785786_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing.
785786_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources.
785786_13_ITEM7_P59_S3	However, particularly due to the current uncertainty of the credit and financial markets, we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms.
785786_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings.
785786_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 28, 2013 (dollars in millions):
785786_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	1) Includes amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.
785786_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	As of September 28, 2013 , the outstanding balance was $75.0 million .
785786_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	The amounts listed above include interest; see Note 5 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	2) Includes $175 million in principal amount of Notes issued in fiscal 2011.
785786_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	The amounts listed above include interest; see Note 5 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	3) As of September 28, 2013 , purchase obligations consist of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business.
785786_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	4) As of September 28, 2013 , other long-term obligations on the balance sheet included deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers, as well as other key employees, and an asset retirement obligation.
785786_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	We have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately $7.4 million , as of September 28, 2013 , related to unrecognized income tax benefits.
785786_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	The Company cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to this obligation.
785786_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	5) As of September 28, 2013 , other long-term obligations not on the balance sheet consisted of a commitment for salary continuation in the event employment of one executive officer of the Company is terminated without cause as well as commitments to complete new manufacturing facilities in Guadalajara, Mexico, Neenah, Wisconsin and Oradea, Romania.
785786_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	During fiscal 2013 , there were no material changes to these policies.
785786_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	Our more critical accounting policies are noted below:
785786_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	We used the modified prospective application, under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income beginning with the first period that we adopted the FASB regulation and continuing to be expensed thereafter.
785786_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	We continue to use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value stock options.
785786_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	See Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
785786_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property, plant and equipment are expected to generate.
785786_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value.
785786_13_ITEM7_P70_S3	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_13_ITEM7_P70_S4	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings.
785786_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	Revenue Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled.
785786_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with durations of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_13_ITEM7_P73_S3	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling, if applicable.
785786_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_13_ITEM7_P74_S3	All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value.
785786_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability (a fair value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge), or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.
785786_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
785786_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualify as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability.
785786_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income , until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
785786_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in the Accumulated other comprehensive income accounts within shareholders equity.
785786_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	See Note 6 Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements for further details.
785786_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
785786_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
785786_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_13_ITEM7_P77_S3	The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
785786_13_ITEM7_P77_S4	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_13_ITEM7_P77_S5	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
785786_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Foreign Currency Risk We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for fiscal 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 were as follows:
785786_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Based on the Company s overall currency exposure, as of September 28, 2013 , a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have financial instruments, including cash equivalents, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions and have entered into interest rate swaps for our term loans.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	For more information, refer to Note 6, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Interest rate swap agreements are subject to the further risk that the counterparties to these agreements may fail to comply with their obligations thereunder.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	To achieve this, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of highly rated securities, money market funds and certificates of deposit, and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P6_S2	As of September 28, 2013 , our only material interest rate risk is associated with our term loan under our Credit Facility.
785786_13_ITEM7A_P6_S3	Through the use of interest rate swaps, as described above, we fixed the basis on which we pay interest, and the borrowings under the Note Purchase Agreement are based on a fixed interest rate, thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk.
785786_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	See Part IV, Item 15 on page 40.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures: The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have reviewed and evaluated, with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date ).
785786_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, and (b) in assuring that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
785786_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Management of the Company, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2013 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
785786_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on its assessment and those criteria, management of the Company has concluded that, as of September 28, 2013 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2013 , as stated in its report included herein on page 42.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls: Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P3_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P3_S5	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P3_S6	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
785786_13_ITEM9A_P3_S7	Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have nonetheless reached the conclusion that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Plexus Corp.:
785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries at September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S2	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S3	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S4	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S5	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S6	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S8	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S9	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S10	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
785786_13_ITEM15_P3_S11	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
785786_13_ITEM15_P4_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
785786_13_ITEM15_P4_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
785786_13_ITEM15_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
785786_13_ITEM15_P4_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

785786_13_ITEM15_P9_S0	Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business: Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together Plexus or the Company ) participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ( EMS ) industry.
785786_13_ITEM15_P10_S0	Plexus delivers optimized Product Realization solutions through a unique Product Realization Value Stream services model.
785786_13_ITEM15_P10_S1	This customer focused services model seamlessly integrates innovative product conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and sustaining services to deliver comprehensive end-to-end solutions for customers in the Americas ("AMER"), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"), and Asia-Pacific ("APAC") regions.
785786_13_ITEM15_P10_S2	Customer service is provided to over 140 branded product companies in the Networking/Communications, Healthcare/Life Sciences, Industrial/Commercial and Defense/Security/Aerospace market sectors.
785786_13_ITEM15_P10_S3	The Company's customers products typically require exceptional production and supply-chain flexibility, necessitating an optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solution across an integrated global platform.
785786_13_ITEM15_P10_S4	Many of the Company's customers products require complex configuration management and direct order fulfillment to their customers across the globe.
785786_13_ITEM15_P10_S5	In such cases Plexus provides global logistics management and after-market service and repair.
785786_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	The Company's customers products may have stringent requirements for quality, reliability and regulatory compliance.
785786_13_ITEM15_P11_S1	Plexus offers its customers the ability to outsource all phases of product realization, including product specifications; development, design and design verification; regulatory compliance support; prototyping and new product introduction; manufacturing test equipment development; materials sourcing, procurement and supply-chain management; product assembly/manufacturing, configuration and test; order fulfillment, logistics and service/repair.
785786_13_ITEM15_P11_S2	Consolidation Principles and Basis of Presentation:
785786_13_ITEM15_P12_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries.
785786_13_ITEM15_P12_S1	All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
785786_13_ITEM15_P12_S2	The Company s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
785786_13_ITEM15_P12_S3	The Company also uses a 4-4-5 weekly accounting system for the interim periods in each quarter.
785786_13_ITEM15_P12_S4	Each quarter, therefore, ends on a Saturday at the end of the 4-4-5 period.
785786_13_ITEM15_P12_S5	Periodically, an additional week must be added to the fiscal year to re-align with the Saturday closest to September 30.
785786_13_ITEM15_P13_S0	The accounting years for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 each included 364 days.
785786_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	The Company s reportable segments consist of the AMER, APAC and EMEA segments.
785786_13_ITEM15_P14_S1	Refer to Note 12, "Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers," for further details on reportable segments.
785786_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months and are classified as Level 1 in the fair level hierarchy described below.
785786_13_ITEM15_P15_S1	As of September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012 , cash and cash equivalents were the following (in thousands):
785786_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
785786_13_ITEM15_P16_S1	Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
785786_13_ITEM15_P16_S2	Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment.
785786_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond the Company s control.
785786_13_ITEM15_P17_S1	Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory.
785786_13_ITEM15_P17_S2	Any actions taken by the Company s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.
785786_13_ITEM15_P17_S3	Per contractual terms, customer deposits are received by the Company to offset obsolete and excess inventory risks.
785786_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation: These assets are stated at cost.
785786_13_ITEM15_P18_S1	Depreciation, determined on the straight-line method, is based on lives assigned to the major classes of depreciable assets as follows:
785786_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	Certain facilities and equipment held under capital leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the lease terms and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities.
785786_13_ITEM15_P19_S1	Lease amortization is included in depreciation expense (see Note 4, "Property, Plant and Equipment") and the financing component of the lease payments is classified as interest expense.
785786_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	For the capitalization of software costs, the Company capitalizes significant costs incurred in the acquisition or development of software for internal use.
785786_13_ITEM15_P20_S1	This includes costs of both the software and the consultants, as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees directly involved in developing internal use computer software once the final selection of the software is made.
785786_13_ITEM15_P20_S2	Costs incurred prior to the final selection of software and costs not qualifying for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
785786_13_ITEM15_P20_S3	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
785786_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable through estimated future undiscounted cash flows.
785786_13_ITEM15_P21_S1	If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a charge against current operations.
785786_13_ITEM15_P21_S2	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_13_ITEM15_P21_S3	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.
785786_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.
785786_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as program costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_13_ITEM15_P24_S2	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_13_ITEM15_P24_S3	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_13_ITEM15_P24_S4	Net sales from engineering design and development services were less than five percent of total sales for each of fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
785786_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured products based on management s analysis of historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_13_ITEM15_P25_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling.
785786_13_ITEM15_P25_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are provided for the difference between the financial statement balance of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
785786_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized (see Note 7, "Income Taxes").
785786_13_ITEM15_P26_S2	Realization of deferred income tax assets in each of the Company's tax jurisdictions is dependent on the Company s ability to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions.
785786_13_ITEM15_P26_S3	Recognition of deferred income tax assets is evaluated and tax reserves are recorded to address potential exposures related to income tax positions taken by the Company.
785786_13_ITEM15_P26_S4	These reserves are based on the assumptions and past experiences of the Company and provide for the uncertainty surrounding the application of statutes, rules, regulations, and interpretations to its income tax filings.
785786_13_ITEM15_P26_S5	It is possible that the actual costs or benefits relating to these matters may be materially more or less than the amount the Company estimated.
785786_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	Foreign Currency Translation: The Company translates assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at year-end.
785786_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Company translates net sales, expenses and cash flows at the average monthly exchange rates during the respective periods.
785786_13_ITEM15_P27_S2	Adjustments resulting from translation of the financial statements are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income .
785786_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	the entity involved and remeasurement adjustments for foreign operations where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency are included in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as a component of miscellaneous income (expense).
785786_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	Exchange (losses) gains on foreign currency transactions were $(1.2) million , $0.2 million , and $1.0 million for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
785786_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Derivatives: All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair market value.
785786_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Company periodically enters into forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
785786_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability (a fair value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge), or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.

785786_13_ITEM15_P131_S0	Guarantees The Company offers certain indemnifications under its customer manufacturing agreements.
785786_13_ITEM15_P132_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company may from time to time be obligated to indemnify its customers or its customers customers against damages or liabilities arising out of the Company s negligence, misconduct, breach of contract, or infringement of third party intellectual property rights.
785786_13_ITEM15_P132_S1	Certain agreements have extended broader indemnification, and while most agreements have contractual limits, some do not.
785786_13_ITEM15_P132_S2	However, the Company generally does not provide for such indemnities and seeks indemnification from its customers for damages or liabilities arising out of the Company s adherence to customers specifications or designs or use of materials furnished, or directed to be used, by its customers.
785786_13_ITEM15_P132_S3	The Company does not believe its obligations under such indemnities are material.
785786_13_ITEM15_P132_S4	In the normal course of business, the Company also provides its customers a limited warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products manufactured by the Company.
785786_13_ITEM15_P132_S5	Such warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects in the Company s workmanship and meet mutually agreed-upon specifications for periods generally ranging from 12 months to 24 months.
785786_13_ITEM15_P132_S6	If a product fails to comply with the Company s limited warranty, the Company s obligation is generally limited to correcting, at its expense, any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product.
785786_13_ITEM15_P132_S7	The Company s warranty generally excludes defects resulting from faulty customer-supplied components, design defects or damage caused by any party or cause other than the Company.
785786_13_ITEM15_P132_S8	The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized and establishes additional reserves for specifically identified product issues.
785786_13_ITEM15_P132_S9	These costs primarily include labor and materials, as necessary, associated with repair or replacement and are included in the Company's accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current accrued liabilities.
785786_13_ITEM15_P133_S0	The primary factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the value and the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims.
785786_13_ITEM15_P133_S1	As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

785786_13_ITEM15_P160_S1	Your Final Performance Share Units will be equal to the number of Performance Stock Units (at target) times the calculated Performance Factor.
785786_13_ITEM15_P160_S2	(b) Within 15 days following the Change in Control, your Final Performance Stock Units will be paid in the form of Common Stock or common stock of any successor corporation; provided that the Corporation may elect to pay an amount of cash equal to the value of the Common Stock that would otherwise be issued.

785786_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our customer-focused solutions model seamlessly integrates innovative product conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and sustaining solutions.
785786_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Plexus delivers comprehensive end-to-end solutions for customers in the Americas ( AMER ), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA ) and Asia-Pacific ( APAC ) regions.
785786_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	We provide award-winning customer service to more than 140 branded product companies in the Networking/Communications, Healthcare/Life Sciences, Industrial/Commercial and Defense/Security/Aerospace market sectors.
785786_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our customers have stringent quality, reliability and regulatory requirements, requiring exceptional production and supply chain agility.
785786_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	Their products require complex configuration management, direct order fulfillment (to end customers) and global logistics management and aftermarket services.
785786_14_ITEM1_P1_S4	To service the complexities that our customers' products demand, we utilize our Product Realization Value Stream, addressing our customers' products from concept to end of life.
785786_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Plexus is passionate about being the leading EMS company in the world at servicing mid-to-low volume, higher complexity customer programs, characterized by unique flexibility, technology, quality and regulatory requirements.
785786_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	To support and deliver on our strategy, we align our operations, processes, workforce and financial metrics through a multidimensional business strategy that includes:
785786_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	Execution driven by a collaborative, customer centric culture that continuously evaluates and optimizes our business processes to support our economic return goals.
785786_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	We operate flexible manufacturing facilities and processes designed to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations.
785786_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	Each of our customers is supported by a multi-disciplinary customer team.
785786_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	One or more uniquely configured focus factories, supported by a supply chain and logistics solution, are designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness to support customer fulfillment requirements.
785786_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our go-to-market strategy is implemented through the four market sectors we serve.
785786_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	Each market sector has a dedicated business development and customer management team.
785786_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	These teams execute our sector strategies through expertise in markets and technology as well as unique quality and regulatory capabilities.
785786_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	Our sector teams help define Plexus' strategy for growth with a particular focus on expanding the value-added solutions we offer customers.
785786_14_ITEM1_P5_S4	Our financial model aligns with our business strategy.
785786_14_ITEM1_P5_S5	Our primary focus is to earn a return on invested capital ( ROIC ) 500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ), which we refer to as economic return.
785786_14_ITEM1_P5_S6	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; at the end of fiscal 2014 our estimated WACC was 11.0 percent.
785786_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	We believe economic profit is a fundamental driver of shareholder value.
785786_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	Plexus measures economic profit by taking the difference between ROIC and WACC and multiplying it by invested capital.
785786_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	By exercising discipline to generate an ROIC in excess of our WACC, with focus on economic profit, our goal is to ensure that Plexus creates value for our shareholders.
785786_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, flexibility and fulfillment requirements, and complex regulatory requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs.
785786_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	The cost variance from our competitors is especially evident relative to those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics).
785786_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with many other technology pioneering start-ups or emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities.
785786_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	As a result of serving market sectors that rely on advanced electronics technology, our business is influenced by critical technological trends such as the level and rate of development of wired and wireless telecommunications infrastructure, communications data and data bandwidth growth, and Internet usage.
785786_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	In addition to prime technology advancements, key government and policy trends impact our business, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's ( FDA ) approval of new medical devices, defense procurement practices, and other government and regulatory processes.
785786_14_ITEM1_P8_S3	Plexus may benefit from increasing outsourcing trends.
785786_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	We provide select services on a consignment basis, meaning the customer supplies the necessary materials and Plexus provides the labor and other services required for product assembly.
785786_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	In addition to manufacturing, turnkey services require material procurement and warehousing and involve greater resource investments than consignment services.
785786_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Other than certain test equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
785786_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	Established in 1979 as a Wisconsin corporation, we have approximately 12,000 full-time employees, including approximately 1,700 engineers and technologists dedicated to product development and design, test equipment development and design, and manufacturing process development and control, all of whom operate from 25 active facilities, totaling approximately 3.6 million square feet.
785786_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	Plexus' facilities are strategically located to support the global supply chain, as well as manufacturing and engineering needs of customers in our targeted market sectors.
785786_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	Plexus maintains a website at www.plexus.com.
785786_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	As soon as is reasonably practical, and after we electronically file or furnish all reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), we provide online copies, free of charge.
785786_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	These reports include: Proxy Statements, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Specialized Disclosure Reports on Form SD, and amendments to those reports.
785786_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics is also posted on our website.

785786_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	As our partnerships grow and mature, we aim to engage our customers in full utilization of our Product Realization Value Stream.
785786_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	During the product development and conceptualization phases, new product ideas are created and evaluated with both the customer's and Plexus' engineering teams.
785786_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	We closely collaborate with our customers to capture their new product vision and clarify requirements.
785786_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	Our industrial design team attempts to analyze a product through the end user's eyes focusing on ergonomics, use case research, user interface, aesthetics and evaluation mockups.
785786_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	Upon completion of concept evaluations, the Plexus team prototypes what it believes to be the most promising designs, working concurrently with engineering, manufacturing and supply chain teams.
785786_14_ITEM1_P13_S4	Future phases ensure design intent is maintained, while realizing the final product solution.
785786_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Plexus invests in the latest technology, design and automation tools to provide comprehensive design and value-engineering solutions.
785786_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	We engage with our customers in a variety of ways - from supporting a short-term expansion of their engineering design capabilities to collaborating on complex turn-key product design.
785786_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	Our disciplined approach and structure enables significant project schedule flexibility via work-sharing across our organization.
785786_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Product design includes, but is not limited to, the following solutions:
785786_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Of all the phases in our Product Realization Value Stream, the commercialize phase carries the most influence with respect to converting ideas into viable products.
785786_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	Commercialization starts early in the design phase and extends through manufacturing transition, often in tandem with Design for Excellence ( DFX ).
785786_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Our DFX solutions encompass a wide collection of specific design solutions including design for test, design for manufacturability/assembly and design for fabrication.
785786_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	The goal of DFX is to facilitate an efficient transition from engineering to manufacturing.
785786_14_ITEM1_P16_S4	The commercialize phase also includes prototyping, new product introduction, design for supply chain, test development and transition management.
785786_14_ITEM1_P16_S5	We believe our commercialization solutions provide significant value by accelerating time-to-market, reducing change activity and providing customers with a robust and enduring product.
785786_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Plexus applies an optimized manufacturing approach, not a one-size-fits-all model.
785786_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our scalable manufacturing solutions integrate flexibility for our customers through tailored supply chain solutions.
785786_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our focus-factory model provides a dedicated team designed to drive success while saving time and money.
785786_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Focus-factories place the customer at the center of operations, executing within a culture of continuous improvement.
785786_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	Plexus exclusively focuses on mid-to-low volume, higher-complexity programs that range from lower-level assemblies to finished electro-mechanical products.
785786_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	Our manufactured products typically fall into one of the following categories in our assembly spectrum:
785786_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Mechatronic integration - more complex system integration that combines electronic controls with mechanical systems and processes such as motion control, robotics, drive systems, fluidics, hydraulics or pneumatics System and mechatronic integration products may run larger in size than other assemblies; the products range from kiosks to finished healthcare devices and life sciences equipment to other complex electro-mechanical assemblies.
785786_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	These products often combine other integrated solutions we provide and may require further unique facility configurations or supply chain solutions.
785786_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Plexus offers fulfillment and logistics solutions to all our customers in the forms of Direct Order Fulfillment ( DOF ), Build to Order ( BTO ) and Configure to Order ( CTO ).
785786_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Plexus receives DOF orders from our customers that provide the final specifications and configurations required by their end customer.
785786_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	Through BTO and CTO, Plexus delivers the product directly to the end customer.
785786_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	The DOF process relies on Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) systems integrating the overall supply chain, from parts procurement through manufacturing and logistics.
785786_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Plexus provides our customers with a range of aftermarket services to support their products after launch into the market.
785786_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Alternate component sourcing and supplier qualification Regulatory requirements.
785786_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	All Plexus manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to a baseline Quality Management System standard per ISO9001:2008.

785786_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	During fiscal 2014 , we served approximately 140 customers.
785786_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	We offer advanced design and production capabilities, allowing our customers to concentrate on their core competencies.
785786_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	Plexus helps accelerate our customers' time to market, reduce their investment in engineering and manufacturing capacity, and optimize total product cost.
785786_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	ARRIS Group, Inc. ( Arris ) and General Electric Company ( GE ), accounted for 12.5 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively, of our net sales in fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Juniper Networks, Inc. ( Juniper ), which accounted for 12.8 percent of our net sales in fiscal 2013 and 16.0 percent of our net sales in fiscal 2012, disengaged from Plexus in fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Other than Arris and GE in fiscal 2014 and Juniper in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, no other customer accounted for 10.0 percent or more of our net sales in those fiscal years.
785786_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays, modifications and transitions.
785786_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers.
785786_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Customers' forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions.
785786_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations.
785786_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	The loss of any major customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.
785786_14_ITEM1_P28_S3	In addition, as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector.
785786_14_ITEM1_P28_S4	Many of our large customers contract with us through independent multiple divisions, subsidiaries, production facilities or locations.
785786_14_ITEM1_P28_S5	We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others.
785786_14_ITEM1_P28_S6	The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 is shown in the following table:
785786_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Although our current business development focus is based on our targeted market sectors, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources geographically (see Note 12 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments).

785786_14_ITEM1_P45_S7	To do so we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees.
785786_14_ITEM1_P45_S8	Approximately 240 and 315 of our employees are covered by union agreements in the United Kingdom and Mexico, respectively.
785786_14_ITEM1_P45_S9	These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year, although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years.
785786_14_ITEM1_P45_S10	Our employees in China, Germany, Malaysia, Romania and the United States are not covered by union agreements.
785786_14_ITEM1_P45_S11	We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities.
785786_14_ITEM1_P45_S12	We believe that our employee relationships are generally positive and stable.
785786_14_ITEM1_P45_S13	Executive Officers See Part III, Item 10.
785786_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this Form 10-K Report for information about the Company's Executive Officers of the Registrant.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions and world events.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose any of these customers or if there are problems in those market sectors, our net sales and operating results could decline significantly.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ten largest customers accounted for 55.1 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2014, and 54.5 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2013.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	For the fiscal year ended September 27, 2014, there were two customers that each represented 10.0 percent or more of our net sales.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	For the fiscal year ended September 28, 2013, there was one customer that represented 10.0 percent or more of our net sales.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our principal customers may vary from period to period, and our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all, particularly given the volatile nature of certain programs.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S6	For example, a customer that formerly represented more than 10.0 percent of our net sales disengaged from us in fiscal 2013 and is no longer a customer; we may experience other significant customer disengagements in the future.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Especially given our discrete number of customers, significant reductions in net sales to any of these customers, the loss of major customers or our failure to make appropriate choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business and results of operations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S8	In addition, we focus our sales efforts on customers in only a few market sectors, and we endeavor to carefully choose those sectors.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Shifts in the performance of a sector served by Plexus, as well as the economic, business and/or regulatory conditions that affect the sector, or our failure to choose appropriate sectors, can particularly impact Plexus.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S11	For instance, sales in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector are substantially affected by trends in the healthcare industry, such as government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the financial health of, and pending changes in the structure of, the U.S. health care sector generally, including as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Affordable Care Act").
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Further, potential reductions in U.S. government agency spending, including those due to budget cuts or other political developments or issues, could affect opportunities in all of our market sectors.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P2_S13	Any weakness in the market sectors in which our customers are concentrated could affect our business and results of operations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	From time to time, our customers, including formerly significant customers, have been affected by merger and acquisition activity.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	While these transactions may present Plexus with opportunities to capture new business, they also create the risk that these customers will partially or completely disengage as a result of transitioning such business to other contract manufacturers or deciding to manufacture the products internally.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Plexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and currency risks.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We have operations in many countries; operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate now represent a majority of our net sales.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	These international aspects of our operations, which are likely to increase over time, subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results:
785786_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	regulatory requirements and potential changes to those requirements.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We continue to monitor our risk associated with foreign currency translation and have entered into limited forward contracts to address this risk.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	As our international operations expand, our failure to appropriately address foreign currency transactions and/or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties, tariffs, taxes or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	For example, our facilities in Mexico operate under the Mexican Maquiladora ("IMMEX") program.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations; we could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Our customers do not make long-term commitments and may cancel or change their production requirements.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	EMS companies must respond quickly to the requirements of their customers in both design and production.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Customers also cancel requirements, change engineering or other service requirements, change production quantities, delay production or revise their forecasts for a number of reasons that are beyond our control.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our working capital levels.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred from time to time and may continue to occur.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S6	In addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers requirements, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital management, facility requirements, personnel needs and other resource requirements.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S7	The short-term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Since many of our operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our operating results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Moreover, since our margins vary across customers and specific programs, a reduction in demand with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S10	Rapid increases in customer requirements may stress personnel and other capacity resources.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S11	We may not have sufficient resources at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S12	We have a complex business model, and our failure to properly manage that model could affect our operations, financial results and reputation Our business model focuses on products and services in the mid-to-lower-volume, higher-complexity segment of the EMS market.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S13	Our customers products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility, in some cases necessitating optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solutions across an integrated global platform.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P6_S14	The products we manufacture are also typically complex, highly regulated, and require complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	These resources include working capital, management and technical personnel, and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse manufacturing, regulatory and service requirements for multiple programs of varying sizes simultaneously, including in multiple locations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We also depend on bringing new customers and programs online and on transitioning production for new customers and programs, which creates added complexities related to managing the start-up risks of such projects, especially for companies that did not previously outsource such activities.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The complexity of our service model often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations as well as commitments from us to our customers.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If we fail to meet those obligations, it could result in claims against us and/or adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we fail to effectively manage or execute our business model, we may lose customer confidence and our reputation may suffer.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The Company s reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to maintain or expand business opportunities could be impaired and our financial results could suffer on a going-forward basis.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our products are for end markets that require technologically advanced products with relatively short life-cycles.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Factors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve, in particular short product life-cycles, could seriously affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Even if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business relationships with them and our production for them, can affect our production cycles, inventory management and results of operations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs, or the provision of new services, could affect our operations and financial results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new work or types of services for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to opportunities.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We must initially determine whether it would be in our interests from a business perspective to pursue a particular potential new customer, program or service, including evaluating the customer s, program s and/or service's fit with our value proposition as well as its potential end-market success.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If we make the decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the anticipated costs, risks, and rewards of an opportunity.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P9_S6	The failure to make prudent engagement decisions and/or to establish appropriate terms of engagement could adversely affect our profitability and margins.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Also, there are inherent risks associated with the timing and ultimate realization of a new program s anticipated revenue; these factors can sometimes extend for a significant period.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Some new programs require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and competencies.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, as a result of production startup costs, new programs are inherently less efficient in their earlier phases than mature programs.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We may not meet customer expectations, which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver conforming product on a timely basis.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market acceptance, regulatory approvals and/or economic conditions.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute on a new program s requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In recent years, our revenue growth has been heavily biased toward ramping new program wins as compared to end-market growth of mature programs.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P10_S7	The management of resources in connection with the establishment of new or recent programs and customer relationships, as well as program transfers between facilities, and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross and operating margins and level of working capital.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P10_S8	These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life-cycle of new products and programs, which lack a track record of order volume and timing as well as production efficiencies in the early stages.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	therefore, we are exposed to these factors in varying magnitudes.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, if any of these programs or customer relationships were terminated, our operating results could worsen, particularly in the short term.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We conduct these transfers on a regular basis to meet customer needs, seek long-term efficiencies or respond to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures, such as the current transfer of our operations in Mexico from Juarez to our new facility in Guadalajara.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Although we try to minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between Plexus facilities, there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P11_S5	While these factors tend to affect new, recent or transferred programs, they can also impact more mature, or maturing programs and customer relationships, especially programs where end-market demand can be somewhat volatile.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction, if any, may seriously harm our business.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction to adjust to customers needs and market demands.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Plexus regularly contends with these issues and must carefully manage its business to meet customer and market requirements.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Expansion and consolidation, including the transfer of operations to larger facilities or acquisitions, can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In fiscal 2014, we opened new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. (Neenah, Wisconsin) and in Mexico (Guadalajara) to replace existing facilities in those countries.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	During fiscal 2013, we opened a new manufacturing facility in China (Xiamen) and a replacement facility in Romania (Oradea).
785786_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we are unable to effectively manage our recent expansions and consolidations, or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, we may expand our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Other risks of current or future expansions, acquisitions and consolidations include:
785786_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the expansion.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entail short-term costs, reductions in capacity and/or employment could impair our ability to respond to market improvements or to maintain customer relationships.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	When we make decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring charges, as we did in fiscal 2014 in connection with the replacement of facilities in the U.S. and Mexico.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P15_S6	In addition, to meet our customers needs, particularly when the production requirements of certain products is site-specific, or to achieve increased efficiencies, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Since customers needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We may also encounter situations where our lack of a physical presence in certain locations may limit or foreclose opportunities.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Changes in tax laws, potential tax disputes, negative or unforeseen tax consequences and/or further developments affecting our deferred tax assets could affect our results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition, other recently adopted or potential changes to tax laws in the other jurisdictions in which we operate could also affect our results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company has been granted a tax holiday for its Malaysian subsidiary.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This tax holiday expires in 2024 and is subject to certain conditions with which we expect to comply and we would risk adverse tax consequences if we do not.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Plexus is eligible for up to $15.0 million in Wisconsin state tax credits in connection with our new manufacturing facility in Neenah, Wisconsin, which opened in fiscal 2014, if we meet certain requirements related to, among other matters, job creation and retention, employee training and capital investment.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If we do not comply with these requirements, we may not be able to realize all, or any, of these tax credits.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	As of September 27, 2014, approximately $6.0 million has been recorded as an other receivable related to the credits.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of an additional valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	An inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, may adversely affect our business and reputation.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a global company with a complex business model, we heavily depend on our information systems to support our customers requirements and to successfully manage our business.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to system and data security, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our information systems, like those of other companies, are susceptible to malicious damage, intrusions and outages due to, among other events, viruses, industrial espionage, break-ins and similar events, other breaches of security, natural disasters, power loss or telecommunications failures.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency and recovery processes.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	However, any operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers financial, product and other confidential information, result in adverse regulatory actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	We and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations and industry standards, and the impact of certain future regulations remains uncertain; failure to comply with such regulations and standards could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are subject to extensive government regulation and industry standards (as well as customer-specific standards) relating to the products we design and manufacture as well as how we conduct our business, including regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support and many other facets of our operations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Failure or noncompliance with such regulations or standards could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	As a publicly-held company, we are subject to increasingly stringent laws, regulations and other requirements, including those resulting from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, affecting, among other areas, our accounting, internal controls, corporate governance practices, securities disclosures and reporting.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	For example, the SEC recently adopted disclosure requirements related to the use of specified "conflict" minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by publicly-held companies.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Compliance with such requirements could increase costs and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly aggressive in adopting and enforcing anti-corruption laws.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, among others, apply to us and our operations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Affordable Care Act significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the United States and is expected to impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance and/or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is subject to statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety, including Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulations and similar regulations in other countries.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Failure to comply with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of devices, or total or partial suspension of production.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We also design and manufacture products for customers in the defense, security and aerospace industries.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Companies that design and manufacture products for these industries face significant regulation by the Department of Defense, Department of State, Federal Aviation Authority, and other governmental agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries, and also under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, whenever we pursue business in new sectors and subsectors, or our customers pursue new technologies or markets, we need to navigate the potentially heavy regulatory and legislative burdens of such sectors, technologies or markets.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	For example, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, as well as the financial health of health care providers, and pending changes in how health care in the U.S. is structured, including as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in this sector as well as impact our margins.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards, including many of the industry-specific regulations discussed above.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Our customers' failure to comply could affect their businesses, which in turn would affect our sales to them.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P29_S4	In addition, if our customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs for these customers and create inefficiencies in our business.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P29_S5	A failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, and third party certification requirements, including those related to social responsibility, could adversely affect our business and reputation.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P29_S6	In addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own social responsibility, conflict minerals, quality or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P29_S7	Such policies or standards may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third party organizations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P29_S8	For example, in fiscal 2014 the Company became an Applicant Member in the EICC.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The EICC is a non-profit coalition of electronics companies and establishes standards for its members in responsible and ethical practices in the areas of labor, environmental compliance, employee health and safety, ethics and social responsibility.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our compliance with these policies, standards and third party certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	There may be problems with the products we design or manufacture that could result in liability claims against us and reduced demand for our services.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The products that we design and/or manufacture may be subject to liability or claims in the event that defects are discovered or alleged.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We design and manufacture products to our customers specifications, many of which are highly complex, and produce products for industries, such as health care, defense and aerospace, that tend to have higher risk profiles.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the design and/or manufacturing of these products, including as a result of business continuity issues.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Whether or not we are responsible, problems in the products we manufacture, whether real or alleged, whether caused by faulty customer specifications, the design or manufacturing processes or a component defect, may result in delayed shipments to customers and/or reduced or canceled customer orders.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P31_S5	In addition, problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P31_S6	These potential claims may include damages for the recall of a product and/or injury to person or property.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Even if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P31_S8	While we seek to insure against many of these risks, insurance coverage may be inadequate, not cost effective or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products or issues.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P31_S9	We occasionally incur costs defending claims, and any such disputes could affect our business relationships.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	If we are unable to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise, our results may be adversely affected.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The markets for our manufacturing, engineering and other services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process developments.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our internal processes are also subject to these factors.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	The continued success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to:
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	In addition, we may have to acquire new design, assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S4	The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements, and our need to maintain our personnel and other resources during times of fluctuating demand, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Our design and manufacturing services and the products offered by our customers involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S8	In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S9	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S10	In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S11	We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S12	Infringement by our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and disrupt our production.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S13	Additionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S14	Such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products, and could affect our customer relationships more broadly.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P33_S15	Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and components upon which we rely.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Increased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The EMS industry is highly competitive.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We compete against numerous EMS providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of designing and manufacturing products internally and may choose to design and/or manufacture products themselves rather than outsource such activities.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Consolidations and other changes in the EMS industry result in a changing competitive landscape.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Some of our competitors have a larger geographic footprint than we do, in addition to substantially greater managerial, manufacturing, engineering, technical, financial, systems, sales and marketing resources than ourselves.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	be better positioned to compete on price for their services.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may operate at a cost disadvantage compared to other EMS providers that have lower internal cost structures or greater direct buying power with component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or become increasingly competitive.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or loss of market share.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our manufacturing services involve inventory risk.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Most of our contract manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts and/or orders.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	A customer s cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Engineering changes by a customer may result in obsolete materials or components.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory and require customers to reimburse us for these items, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or be able to collect on these obligations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Excess or obsolete inventory, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S4	These managed inventory programs result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to the risk of enforcing those obligations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S6	We may experience raw material and component shortages and price fluctuations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S7	We do not have any long-term supply agreements.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S8	At various times in the recent past, we have experienced raw material and component shortages due to supplier capacity constraints or their failure to deliver.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S9	We also could experience disruptions in energy supplies.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S10	Periodic shortages may occur in the future.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P40_S11	Such constraints can also be caused by world events, such as government policies, terrorism, armed conflict, natural disasters, economic recession and other localized events.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used in the assembly process and, in some cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular raw material or component.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Such suppliers may encounter quality problems, labor disputes, financial difficulties or business continuity issues that could preclude them from delivering raw materials or components timely or at all.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Some suppliers have ceased doing business due to economic or other circumstances, and more may do so in the future.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Supply shortages and delays in deliveries of raw materials or components have in some cases resulted in delayed production of assemblies, which have increased our inventory levels and adversely affected our operating results in certain periods.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S4	An inability to obtain sufficient inventory on a timely basis could also harm relationships with our customers.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S5	In addition, raw materials and components that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Certain materials provided to us may be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S7	The need to obtain replacement materials and parts may negatively affect our manufacturing operations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S8	The inadvertent use of any such parts or products may also give rise to liability claims.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S9	Raw material and component supply shortages and delays in deliveries can also result in increased pricing.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S10	While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in raw material or component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S11	Conversely, as a result of our pricing strategies and practices, raw material and component price reductions have contributed positively to our operating results in the past.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S12	Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S13	We depend on our workforce, including certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel or other personnel disruptions, including the inability to hire and retain sufficient personnel, may harm our business.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S14	Our success depends in large part on the continued services of our key technical and management personnel, and on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, particularly highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of products.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S15	The competition for these individuals is significant, and the loss of key employees could harm our business.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S16	From time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, disability, death and other terminations of service that affect our executive officers and other key employees.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P41_S17	Transitions of responsibilities among officers and key employees, particularly those that are unplanned, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, which could have an effect on our results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We also depend on good relationships with our workforce generally.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Any disruption in our relationships with our personnel, including as a result of potential union organizing activities, work actions or other labor issues, could substantially affect our operations and results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In addition, when we expand operations in either existing areas or new locations, including internationally, we need to attract and retain the services of sufficient qualified personnel to conduct those operations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If we fail to retain and maintain sufficient qualified personnel, the operations at those locations, and consequently our financial results, could be adversely affected.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S4	In new or existing facilities we may be subject to local labor practices or union activities, wage pressure and changing wage requirements, increasing health care costs, differing employment laws and regulations in various countries, local competition for employees as well as high turnover, and other issues affecting our workforce, all of which could affect operations at particular locations, which also could have adverse effects on our operational results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Natural disasters, breaches of security and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis and floods.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S7	All facilities are subject to other natural or man-made disasters such as those related to global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism or war, breaches of security, theft or espionage, and failures of utilities.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S8	If such an event was to occur, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S9	Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S10	In addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S11	If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S12	Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and thus negatively affect our relationships and financial results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S13	Although we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to physical security, we remain at risk of unauthorized access to our facilities and the possible unauthorized use or theft of inventory, information or other physical assets.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P42_S14	If unauthorized persons gain physical access to our facilities, or our physical assets or information are stolen or used in an unauthorized manner (whether through outside theft or industrial espionage), we could be subject to, among other consequences, negative publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, loss of government contracts, litigation by affected parties and/or other future financial obligations related to the loss, misuse or theft of our or our customers' data, inventory or physical assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may fail to secure or maintain necessary additional financing and/or capital.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We cannot be certain that our existing credit facilities will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit agreement and our interest rate swap agreements, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations, either due to instability in the global financial markets or otherwise.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities (as we did in fiscal 2014) or obtaining new credit facilities, or through a combination of these methods.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P43_S5	We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P43_S6	If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders ownership interests; we may not be able offer our securities on attractive or acceptable terms in the event of volatility or weakness in our stock price.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P43_S7	Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P43_S8	We may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions, as well as strategic arrangements, and may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or recognize the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We have previously grown, in part, through acquisitions and strategic arrangements.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	If we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions, this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	the loss of key employees of acquired businesses.
785786_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	the unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses.
785786_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facilities comprise an integrated network of engineering and manufacturing centers with our corporate headquarters located in Neenah, Wisconsin.
785786_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own or lease facilities with approximately 3.8 million square feet of capacity.
785786_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	This includes approximately 2.0 million square feet in AMER (of which 0.2 million square feet will close in fiscal 2015), approximately 1.4 million square feet in APAC and approximately 0.4 million square feet in EMEA.
785786_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	Approximately 0.2 million square feet of this capacity is subleased.
785786_14_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our facilities as of September 27, 2014 , are described in the following table:
785786_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) The facilities in Penang, Malaysia, Xiamen, China, and Buffalo Grove, Illinois include more than one building.
785786_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	(2) The facility in Guadalajara, Mexico opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to replace the facility in Juarez, Mexico.
785786_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	The facility in Juarez is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2015.
785786_14_ITEM2_P1_S3	(3) The manufacturing facility in Neenah, Wisconsin opened during fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM2_P1_S4	(4) The facility in San Diego, California is subleased and no longer used in operations.
785786_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is party to certain lawsuits and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
785786_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management does not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
785786_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market Price per Share For the fiscal years ended September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 , the Company s common stock has traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market, in the NASDAQ Global Select Market tier.
785786_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The price information below represents high and low sale prices of our common stock for each quarterly period.
785786_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total return on Plexus common stock with the NASDAQ Stock Market Index for U.S. Companies and the NASDAQ Stock Market Index for Electronic Components Companies, both of which include Plexus.
785786_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	The values on the graph show the relative performance of an investment of $100 made on October 3, 2009, in Plexus common stock and in each of the indices as of the last business day of the respective fiscal year.
785786_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	Shareholders of Record; Dividends As of November 13, 2014, there were 515 shareholders of record.
785786_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	We have not paid any cash dividends in the past.
785786_14_ITEM5_P2_S2	We currently anticipate that the majority of earnings in the foreseeable future will be retained to finance the development of our business and our authorized share repurchase.
785786_14_ITEM5_P2_S3	However, the Company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include additional share repurchases, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_14_ITEM5_P2_S4	See also Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources , for a discussion of the Company s intentions regarding dividends, and loan covenants which could restrict dividend payments.
785786_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table provides the specified information about the repurchases of shares by the Company during the three months ended September 27, 2014 :
785786_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	* On August 19, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock in fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	During fiscal 2014 , the Company repurchased 733,447 shares under this program for $30.0 million , at an average price of $40.90 per share.
785786_14_ITEM5_P4_S2	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_14_ITEM5_P4_S3	On August 13, 2014, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock in fiscal 2015.
785786_14_ITEM5_P4_S4	Accordingly, since this program became effective subsequent to September 27, 2014 , the $30.0 million authorization is excluded from the table above.
785786_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) During fiscal 2014, the Company recorded $11.3 million in restructuring and impairment charges, which are included in operating income.
785786_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	These charges largely related to the Company's consolidation of its facilities in the Fox Cities (Neenah and Appleton), Wisconsin, as well as its relocation of manufacturing operations from Juarez, Mexico to a new manufacturing facility in Guadalajara, Mexico.
785786_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	(2) The Company defines return on invested capital as tax-effected operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period.
785786_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	(3) In fiscal 2012, the Company established a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets resulting in an additional tax provision of approximately $20.6 million ($22.8 million provision, offset by $2.2 million to other comprehensive income) and a decrease in diluted earnings per share of $0.64.
785786_14_ITEM6_P2_S1	Return on invested capital excludes the $20.6 million net deferred tax asset reduction.
785786_14_ITEM6_P2_S2	An additional $1.3 million of valuation allowance established for fiscal 2012 relates to operating losses in Germany and Romania making the total valuation allowance for that year $24.1 million.

785786_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	This facility is replacing our existing facility in Juarez, Mexico, which will be closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2015.
785786_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	This transition resulted in approximately $7.0 million of restructuring and impairment charges during fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	Closure of the facility in Juarez is expected to result in approximately $1.5 to $1.8 million of additional restructuring charges in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.
785786_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	We opened our new manufacturing facility in Neenah, Wisconsin during the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	This facility consolidated one owned and two leased facilities in the Fox Cities (Neenah and Appleton), Wisconsin.
785786_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	The consolidation of these facilities resulted in approximately $4.3 million of restructuring charges during fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Performance Summary.
785786_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 (dollars in millions, except per share data):
785786_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2014 increased $150.2 million, or 6.7 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	The net sales increase was primarily the result of a $134.1 million increase in net sales in the healthcare/life sciences sector, as well as net sales increases in the industrial/commercial and defense/security/aerospace sectors, partially offset by a reduction in net sales in the networking/communication sector.
785786_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	headwind related to the disengagement of Juniper Networks, Inc. ("Juniper") in fiscal 2013, partially offset by a $230.3 million increase in net sales to two key customers in that sector primarily resulting from new product ramps.
785786_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Net sales for fiscal 2013 decreased $78.7 million, or 3.4 percent, as compared to fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	The net sales decrease was primarily the result of a $113.6 million decrease in net sales for one of our larger customers in the industrial/commercial sector, as a result of its decreased end-market demand, as well as an $85.3 million decrease in net sales to Juniper as a result of its disengagement and lower end-market demand for the products we formerly produced for Juniper.
785786_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	These decreases were partially offset by a $102.4 million increase in net sales to various significant customers in all sectors.
785786_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	Our net sales by market sector for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were as follows (in millions):
785786_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the networking/communications sector decreased $63.8 million, or 7.7 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The change was primarily the result of a $282.6 million decrease in net sales to Juniper, related to its disengagement, partially offset by a $230.3 million increase in sales related to two key customers in this sector primarily resulting from new program ramps.
785786_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2013 in the networking/communications sector decreased $77.3 million as compared to fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	The change was primarily the result of an $85.3 million decrease in net sales to Juniper, related to its disengagement, partially offset by increased sales to existing customers in this sector as well as program ramps with new customers.
785786_14_ITEM7_P8_S4	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the healthcare/life sciences sector increased $134.1 million, or 23.8 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P8_S5	The increase was primarily due to $89.3 million of new program ramps and increased end-market demand for two key customers in this sector and increased end-market demand and new program ramps across several other customers in this sector.
785786_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2013 in the healthcare/life sciences sector increased $68.8 million as compared to fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	The increase was primarily due to market share gains and new program ramps with existing customers.
785786_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the industrial/commercial sector increased $32.5 million, or 5.9 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	The increase was primarily the result of the expansion of current business with one of our larger customers in the sector, which accounted for $30.7 million of the increased net sales as compared to the prior year.
785786_14_ITEM7_P9_S4	Net sales for fiscal 2013 in the industrial/commercial sector decreased $119.8 million as compared to fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P9_S5	The decrease was primarily a result of decreased end-market demand for one of our larger customers in the sector, which accounted for $113.6 million of the decreased net sales as compared to the prior year.
785786_14_ITEM7_P9_S6	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the defense/security/aerospace sector increased $47.4 million, or 16.5 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P9_S7	The increase was primarily due to $37.5 million resulting from new program ramps and increased end-market demand for one of our larger customers in the sector.
785786_14_ITEM7_P9_S8	Net sales for fiscal 2013 in the defense/security/aerospace sector increased $49.6 million as compared to fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P9_S9	The increase was the result of new program ramps as well as increased end-market demand for the products we produce for our customers.
785786_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	As a percentage of consolidated net sales, net sales attributable to customers representing 10.0 percent or more of consolidated net sales as well as the percentage of net sales attributable to our ten largest customers for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, were as follows:
785786_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Gross profit for fiscal 2014 increased $ 12.4 million , or 5.8 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Overall gross margin decreased to 9.5 percent from 9.6 percent.
785786_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Gross profit increased $34.2 million primarily as a result of increased sales.
785786_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	This favorable effect was largely offset by a $21.9 million increase in fixed costs due to our investment in a new manufacturing facility in Neenah, Wisconsin, the ramp up of new business in the AMER region, and increased depreciation and personnel expenses with our new manufacturing facility in Oradea, Romania.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Gross profit for fiscal 2013 decreased $6.7 million, or 3.1 percent, as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to decreased net sales, increased fixed expenses related to site investments in Penang, Malaysia, Xiamen, China, and Oradea, Romania, and unfavorable changes in customer mix.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The decrease was partially offset by the sale of certain inventory that had previously been written down.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	A slightly larger percentage decrease in revenue as compared to the decrease in gross profit for fiscal 2013 led to an increase in gross margin to 9.6 percent for fiscal 2013 from 9.5 percent for fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	Operating income for fiscal 2014 increased $ 4.0 million as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	A $2.9 million decrease in selling and administrative expenses ("S A") as compared to prior year and the previously discussed increase to gross profit were partially offset by $11.3 million of restructuring and impairment charges primarily related to the consolidation of facilities in the Fox Cities, Wisconsin, and the relocation of manufacturing operations from Juarez, Mexico, to Guadalajara, Mexico.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	As a result, operating margin decreased to 4.2 percent for fiscal 2014 from 4.3 percent for fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S6	Operating income for fiscal 2013 decreased $7.5 million as compared to fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S7	The operating income decrease reflected the $6.7 million decrease in gross profit described above as well as a $0.8 million increase in S A expenses.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S8	The increase in S A was primarily due to approximately $2.4 million of recoveries of receivables previously at risk in the prior fiscal year, with no such recovery in the current fiscal year, and approximately $0.8 million of additional amortization expense in fiscal 2013 related to the Kontron arrangement.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S9	These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and additional reductions due to focused cost management efforts.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S10	As a result of the factors discussed above, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, operating margin decreased from 4.5 percent to 4.3 percent.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S11	Other expense for fiscal 2014 decreased $ 4.4 million as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S12	The decrease in other expense for fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of a $1.3 million increase in interest income, a $1.1 million decrease in currency exchange losses, a $0.8 million decrease in miscellaneous expense due to a favorable outcome related to a previous accrual for expenses related to the termination of an agreement for additional land in Hangzhou, China, and a $0.3 million decrease in interest expense.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S13	Other expense decreased to $11.6 million for fiscal 2013 from $12.9 million for fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P12_S14	The decrease in expense was largely due to $3.4 million of decreased interest expense related to our former term loan.
785786_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Interest rate swaps associated with the original term loan expired in fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	This resulted in lower floating interest rates prior to the establishment of a new interest rate swap agreement and lower fixed interest rates subsequent to the establishment of the new interest rate swap agreement.
785786_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	This decrease was offset by a $1.4 million increase in foreign exchange losses and a $0.8 million increase in other expense as the result of an accrual for property-related expenses related to the termination of an agreement for additional land in Hangzhou, China.
785786_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Income tax expense and effective annual income tax rates, with and without the annual valuation allowance, for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	*The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation of income tax (benefit) expense and effective annual tax rate excluding the impact of the valuation allowance provides a more meaningful comparison of reporting periods.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Income tax expense for fiscal 2014 was $6.1 million compared to $2.7 million for fiscal 2013 and $29.1 million for fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Company's effective annual tax rates vary from the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0% primarily as a result of the mix of earnings from U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and tax holidays granted to subsidiaries located in the APAC region where the Company derives a significant portion of its earnings.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was significantly lower than the effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the amount of the additional valuation allowance recorded in fiscal 2012 on deferred tax assets in the U.S. as well as discrete tax benefits recorded in fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S4	In fiscal 2014, the Company recorded a $7.9 million addition to its valuation allowance relating to continuing losses in certain jurisdictions within the AMER and EMEA regions.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S5	At the close of fiscal 2014, using the measurement criteria found in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"), the Company believes that the positive evidence does not outweigh the negative and the valuation allowance should remain in place.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S6	During fiscal 2014, the Company also recorded tax benefits of $3.8 million primarily related to the lapse of statutes of limitations related to U.S. tax examinations during the fiscal year.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S7	In fiscal 2013, the Company recorded a $7.0 million addition to its valuation allowance, of which $5.2 million related to continuing losses certain jurisdictions within the AMER and EMEA regions.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S8	During fiscal 2013, the Company performed an analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, regarding the need for a valuation allowance against its U.K. deferred tax assets, consistent with the provisions of ASC 740.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S9	Accordingly, the Company established an additional $1.8 million valuation allowance against the U.K. deferred tax assets.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S10	During fiscal 2013 the Company also identified and recorded several out-of-period tax errors that reduced tax expense by $3.2 million.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S11	The Company believes these out-of-period tax errors were not material to the fiscal 2013, or previously issued, financial statements.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S12	In fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $24.1 million, of which $1.3 million related to continuing losses in certain jurisdictions within the EMEA region.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S13	During the preparation of the fiscal 2012 consolidated financial statements, the Company performed an analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, regarding the need for a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets, consistent with the provisions of ASC 740.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S14	Accordingly, the Company established an additional $22.8 million valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S15	The Company has been granted a tax holiday for a foreign subsidiary operating in the APAC region.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S16	This tax holiday will expire in fiscal 2024 and is subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S17	The Company benefited from a second tax holiday within the APAC region until December 31, 2013, when it expired under the terms of the Company's agreement with the local taxing authority.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S18	The expiration of this holiday did not have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate or results of operations.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S19	In fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, these holidays resulted in tax reductions of approximately $24.1 million ($0.71 per basic share), $22.7 million ($0.66 per basic share), and $17.5 million ($0.50 per basic share), respectively.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S20	We currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 to be approximately 8.0 to 10.0 percent.
785786_14_ITEM7_P16_S21	Net income, both including and excluding the annual valuation allowance and out-of-period tax adjustments, for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	*The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation of net income excluding valuation allowances and out-of-period tax adjustments provides a more meaningful comparison of reporting periods.
785786_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Net income for fiscal 2014 increased $5.0 million, or 6.0 percent, to $87.2 million from fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Net income increased primarily as a result of increased gross profit and lower S A expenses, partially offset by increased restructuring and impairment charges and increased income tax expense, as discussed previously.
785786_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	Net income for fiscal 2013 increased $20.2 million, or 32.5 percent, to $82.3 million from fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	This increase was primarily as a result of the net $17.1 million year-over-year valuation allowance adjustment.
785786_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	Excluding the valuation allowance and fourth quarter fiscal 2013 tax out-of-period adjustments, fiscal 2013 net income decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.1 percent, from fiscal 2012 to $86.1 million.
785786_14_ITEM7_P18_S5	Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.52, or 6.8 percent, for fiscal 2014 from $2.36 for fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of increased net income.
785786_14_ITEM7_P18_S6	Further improvement was due to the positive impact of fewer outstanding shares in 2014 due to our common stock repurchase program.
785786_14_ITEM7_P18_S7	These improvements were offset by restructuring and impairment costs.
785786_14_ITEM7_P18_S8	See Note 14, "Shareholders' Equity" in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's stock repurchase programs.
785786_14_ITEM7_P18_S9	See Note 15, "Restructuring and Impairment Costs," in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring and impairment costs.
785786_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.36, or 34.9 percent, for fiscal 2013 from $1.75 for fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of the impact of the valuation allowances and fiscal 2013 out-of-period tax adjustments discussed above.
785786_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Excluding the impact of the valuation allowances and out-of-period tax adjustments, diluted earnings per share increased by $0.04 in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	The increase in diluted earnings per share, as adjusted was primarily due to the positive impact of fewer outstanding shares in 2013 due to the stock repurchase program.
785786_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Return on Invested Capital ( ROIC ).
785786_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	We use a 5-5 financial model which is aligned with our business strategy, and includes a ROIC goal of 500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ), which we refer to as economic return and a 5.0 percent operating margin target.
785786_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	Our primary focus is on our economic return goal of 5.0 percent, which is designed to create shareholder value and generate enough cash to self-fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of 12.0 percent.
785786_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually.
785786_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our WACC was 11.0 percent, 12.0 percent, and 12.5 percent for fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
785786_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	For fiscal 2015, our estimated WACC is 11.0 percent.
785786_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders.
785786_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	ROIC was 15.2 percent, 14.0 percent, and 15.5 percent (excluding a $20.6 million net deferred tax asset reduction) for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
785786_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	The increase in ROIC in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 was due to higher operating income, partially offset by the effect of an increase in average invested capital as a result of capital expenditures for facility expansions.
785786_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	See the table below for our calculation of ROIC (dollars in millions):
785786_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	We define ROIC as tax-effected operating income before restructuring and impairment charges divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period for the fiscal year.
785786_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents.
785786_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way.
785786_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	ROIC and other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
785786_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance.
785786_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	In particular, we provide ROIC because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view ROIC as an important measure in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital requirements.
785786_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	We also use a derivative measure of ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation.
785786_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	For a reconciliation of ROIC to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
785786_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	REPORTABLE SEGMENTS A further discussion of our fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 financial performance by reportable segment is presented below (in millions):
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the AMER segment increased $175.4 million, or 16.5 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to increased net sales of $154.8 million to a key networking/communications customer resulting from a new product ramp.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Increased end-market demand and new product ramps on several of our larger customers across all four sectors drove further increased sales for fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	Partially offsetting these increases was a $115.8 million decrease in net sales from the disengagement of Juniper.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	Operating income for fiscal 2014 increased $4.0 million from fiscal 2013 due primarily to the increase in net sales.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S4	Excluding the impact of restructuring and impairment charges, operating income for fiscal 2014 increased $15.3 million from fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S5	Net sales for fiscal 2013 in the AMER segment decreased $193.1 million, or 15.4 percent, from fiscal 2012, due primarily to $113.6 million of decreased sales resulting from lower end-market demand from a significant industrial/commercial sector customer as well as a $71.1 million decrease in net sales due to a drop in demand from Juniper related to its disengagement and lower end-market demand for the products we formerly produced for Juniper.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S6	Operating income for fiscal 2013 decreased $20.2 million from fiscal 2012 due primarily to the decrease in net sales.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S7	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the APAC segment decreased $13.8 million, or 1.2 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to a $166.8 million decrease in net sales resulting from the disengagement of Juniper.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S8	Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in net sales of $82.9 million to one of our larger networking/communications customers as a result of new product ramps and an increase in net sales of $61.8 million to two of our larger healthcare/life sciences customers.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S9	Operating income increased $19.2 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of favorable changes in customer mix and supply chain productivity.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S10	Net sales for fiscal 2013 in the APAC segment increased $35.9 million, or 3.2 percent, from fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S11	The increase in net sales was primarily experienced in the healthcare/life sciences sector as a result of new program wins which more than offset the $14.2 million decrease in sales to Juniper as a result of its disengagement.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S12	Operating income increased $14.4 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily as a result of the increase in net sales and favorable changes in customer mix combined with higher costs incurred in fiscal 2012 related to facility expansion and the Kontron arrangement.
785786_14_ITEM7_P26_S13	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the EMEA segment decreased $6.6 million, or 5.4 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013, due primarily to the disengagement of two customers.
785786_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	current year as compared to the prior year due to increased fixed manufacturing expenses in both Oradea, Romania and the U.K., resulting from increased depreciation and personnel expenses associated with facility investments.
785786_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2013 in the EMEA segment increased $27.1 million, or 28.4 percent, from fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	The increase in net sales was driven primarily by approximately $22.0 million from the ramp of new customers in each of our market sectors, partially offset by decreased net sales of $8.5 million due to the disengagement of an industrial/commercial customer.
785786_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	Operating loss increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in fixed costs associated with the new facility in Oradea, Romania and the ramping of new customers in the U.K.
785786_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	An increase in labor and parts costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 also contributed to the increased operating loss.
785786_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents were $346.6 million as of September 27, 2014 as compared to $341.9 million as of September 28, 2013 .
785786_14_ITEM7_P28_S5	Cash generated from operations and stock option exercises in fiscal 2014 was substantially offset by cash used for capital expenditures primarily related to facility investments, purchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program, and capital lease payments.
785786_14_ITEM7_P28_S6	As of September 27, 2014 , 90.9 percent of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries.
785786_14_ITEM7_P28_S7	Certain foreign countries impose taxes and overall penalties on transfers of cash; however, our intent is to permanently reinvest funds held in these countries.
785786_14_ITEM7_P28_S8	If this cash were remitted to the U.S., additional tax obligations may result that would reduce the amount of cash ultimately available to us in the U.S.
785786_14_ITEM7_P28_S9	Currently, we believe that cash held in the U.S., together with cash available under U.S. credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities, will be sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.
785786_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The following table provides a summary of cash flows for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , excluding the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (in millions):
785786_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $88.4 million for fiscal 2014 , as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $207.6 million for fiscal 2013 .
785786_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	The decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales, which resulted in higher inventory and accounts receivable balances at the end of fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	Additionally, increases in forecasted net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2014 also resulted in higher inventory and accounts payable balances at the end of fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $207.6 million for fiscal 2013 , as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $157.5 million for fiscal 2012 .
785786_14_ITEM7_P30_S4	Cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to overall improved working capital management.
785786_14_ITEM7_P30_S5	The following table provides a summary of cash cycle days for the periods indicated (in days):
785786_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	We calculate days in accounts receivable as accounts receivable for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	We calculate days in inventory, accounts payable, and cash deposits as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	We calculate annualized cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits.
785786_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Days in accounts receivable for the three months ended September 27, 2014 decreased five days compared to the three months ended September 28, 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The decrease is primarily attributable to new product ramps related to a key customer with shorter payment terms than our other customers.
785786_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	Days in inventory for the three months ended September 27, 2014 increased eight days compared to the three months ended September 28, 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	The increase is primarily attributable to the timing of inventory build-up to support forecasted net sales.
785786_14_ITEM7_P32_S4	Days in accounts payable for the three months ended September 27, 2014 increased four days compared to the three months ended September 28, 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P32_S5	The improvement was primarily attributable to increased purchases from suppliers with more favorable terms to support increases in net sales.
785786_14_ITEM7_P32_S6	Days in cash deposits for the three months ended September 27, 2014 decreased four days compared to the three months ended September 28, 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P32_S7	The decrease was primarily attributable to the return of approximately $11.0 million of excess deposit funds to Juniper in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM7_P32_S8	As of September 27, 2014 cash cycle days increased three days compared to September 28, 2013 due to the factors discussed above.
785786_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Free cash flow ( FCF ), which we define as cash flow provided by (used in) operations less capital expenditures, was $23.1 million for fiscal 2014, as compared to $99.5 million for fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	The decrease of $76.4 million from fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures, which is discussed below.
785786_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures, including FCF, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance.
785786_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	In particular, we provide FCF because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions.
785786_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	We view FCF as an important financial metric as it demonstrates our ability to generate cash and allows us to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.
785786_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure which should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
785786_14_ITEM7_P34_S4	The following table provides a reconciliation of FCF to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP (in millions):
785786_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Cash flows used in investing activities were $62.6 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $107.2 million for fiscal 2013 .
785786_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	The reduction was due to decreases in capital expenditures, which were $65.3 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $108.1 million in fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	This decrease was primarily attributable to a facility investment at one location (Guadalajara, Mexico) during fiscal 2014, relative to facility investments at three locations during fiscal 2013 (Xiamen, China; Oradea, Romania; and Neenah, Wisconsin).
785786_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	Cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal 2013 increased to $107.2 million from $92.2 million in fiscal 2012 .
785786_14_ITEM7_P35_S4	Cash flows used in investing activities increased primarily due to the additional investments in footprint expansions, partially offset by payments for business acquisitions in the prior period, including the Kontron arrangement.
785786_14_ITEM7_P35_S5	We utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal 2014 .
785786_14_ITEM7_P35_S6	We currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 will be approximately $50.0 million.
785786_14_ITEM7_P35_S7	Cash flows used in financing activities were $21.0 million for fiscal 2014 , as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $57.4 million for fiscal 2013 .
785786_14_ITEM7_P35_S8	The decrease was primarily attributable to lower common stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2014 relative to fiscal 2013, as well as term loan repayments in fiscal 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P35_S9	The decrease was further enhanced by the effect of higher stock option exercise activity in fiscal 2014 relative to fiscal 2013 due to more favorable market conditions during fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM7_P35_S10	Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $57.4 million for fiscal 2013, as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $10.8 million for fiscal 2012.
785786_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Cash flows used in financing activities for fiscal 2012 were comprised primarily of payments on debt, partially offset by debt proceeds and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
785786_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	On August 13, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock in fiscal 2015.
785786_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	The Company expects to complete this program on a relatively consistent basis during fiscal 2015.
785786_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	On August 19, 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock in fiscal 2014.
785786_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	During fiscal 2014, the Company repurchased 733,447 shares under this program for $30.0 million , at an average price of $40.90 per share.
785786_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	On October 23, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $50.0 million of its common stock.
785786_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	During fiscal 2013, the Company repurchased 1,821,698 shares under this program for $49.9 million, at an average price of $27.37 per share.
785786_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	On May 15, 2014, the Company entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to its credit agreement, dated as of May 15, 2012 (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"), related to its five-year senior unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility ).
785786_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	As a result of the Amendment, the Credit Facility, which was formerly a $250.0 million facility consisting of a $160.0 million revolving credit facility and a $90.0 million term loan (balance of $75.0 million as of May 15, 2014), was converted into a $235.0 million revolving credit facility, and its termination date was extended from May 15, 2017 to May 15, 2019.
785786_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	The Credit Facility may potentially be increased by $100.0 million to $335.0 million generally by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, subject to certain customary conditions.
785786_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	Quarterly principal repayments on the former term loan of $3.8 million per quarter ended on March 28, 2013.
785786_14_ITEM7_P39_S4	As of September 27, 2014, the Company had $75.0 million of revolving borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.
785786_14_ITEM7_P39_S5	During fiscal 2014, the Company borrowed and repaid $281.0 million of revolving borrowings under the Credit Facility.
785786_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	The financial covenants (as defined under the Credit Agreement) require that the Company maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
785786_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	As of September 27, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit Agreement.
785786_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Borrowings under the Credit Facility, at the Company's option, bear interest at a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the Company's leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement.
785786_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	Rates would increase upon negative changes in specified Company financial metrics and would decrease to no less than LIBOR plus 1.000% or base rate plus 0.000% upon reduction in the current total leverage ratio.
785786_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	As of September 27, 2014, the Company had a borrowing rate of LIBOR plus 1.125%.
785786_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	As of September 27, 2014, all outstanding debt under the Credit Facility is effectively at a fixed interest rate as a result of the interest rate swap contract discussed in Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	There is no floating rate debt outstanding under the Credit Facility as of September 27, 2014.
785786_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	The Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused revolver credit commitment based on the Company's leverage ratio; the fee was 0.175% as of September 27, 2014.
785786_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	The Company also has outstanding 5.20% Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2018 (the "Notes"); $175.0 million principal of the Notes was outstanding as of both September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 .
785786_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Credit Facility and Note Purchase Agreement allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the future repurchases of shares provided that no event of default (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases.
785786_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	We have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not currently anticipate paying them in the future.
785786_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	However, we evaluate from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases above those already authorized, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, potential borrowings under the Credit Facility, and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.
785786_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing.
785786_14_ITEM7_P42_S5	Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources.
785786_14_ITEM7_P42_S6	However, particularly due to the current uncertainty of the credit and financial markets, we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms.
785786_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings.
785786_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	Information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 27, 2014 (dollars in millions):
785786_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	1) Includes amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.
785786_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	As of September 27, 2014 , the outstanding balance was $75.0 million .
785786_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	The amounts listed above include interest; see Note 5 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	2) Includes $175.0 million in principal amount of Notes issued in fiscal 2011.
785786_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	The amounts listed above include interest; see Note 5 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	3) As of September 27, 2014 , purchase obligations consist of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business.
785786_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	4) As of September 27, 2014 , other long-term obligations on the balance sheet included deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers, as well as other key employees, and an asset retirement obligation.
785786_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	We have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately $2.4 million , as of September 27, 2014 , related to unrecognized income tax benefits.
785786_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The Company cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to this obligation.
785786_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	5) As of September 27, 2014 , other long-term obligations not on the balance sheet consisted of a commitment for salary continuation and certain benefits in the event employment of one executive officer of the Company is terminated without cause.
785786_14_ITEM7_P47_S3	Excluded from the amounts disclosed are certain bonus and incentive compensation amounts, which would be paid on a prorated basis in the year of termination.
785786_14_ITEM7_P47_S4	6) Includes future minimum payments under the base lease agreement in Guadalajara, Mexico.
785786_14_ITEM7_P47_S5	Excludes $20.3 million of future minimum payments under renewal options from 2025 through 2034.
785786_14_ITEM7_P47_S6	See Note 4 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	During fiscal 2014 , there were no material changes to these policies.
785786_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	Our more critical accounting estimates are described below: Revenue Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled.
785786_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with durations of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling, if applicable.
785786_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740.
785786_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
785786_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
785786_14_ITEM7_P52_S4	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_14_ITEM7_P52_S5	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
785786_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	We used the modified prospective application, under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income beginning with the first period that we adopted the FASB regulation and continuing to be expensed thereafter.
785786_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value stock options and the Monte Carlo valuation model to value performance stock units.
785786_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	See Note 10, "Benefit Plans" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Foreign Currency Risk We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were as follows:
785786_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Based on the Company s overall currency exposure, as of September 27, 2014 , a 10.0 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have financial instruments, including cash equivalents, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions and have entered into interest rate swaps for our Credit Facility.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	more information, refer to Note 6, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Interest rate swap agreements are subject to the further risk that the counterparties to these agreements may fail to comply with their obligations thereunder.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	To achieve this, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of highly rated securities, money market funds and certificates of deposit, and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P7_S2	As of September 27, 2014 , our only material interest rate risk is associated with our Credit Facility.
785786_14_ITEM7A_P7_S3	Through the use of interest rate swaps, as described above, we fixed the basis on which we pay interest, and the borrowings under the Note Purchase Agreement are based on a fixed interest rate, thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk.
785786_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	NOTE: All other financial statement schedules are omitted because they are not applicable or the required information is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto.
785786_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Plexus Corp.:
785786_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries at September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
785786_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
785786_14_ITEM8_P2_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
785786_14_ITEM8_P2_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
785786_14_ITEM8_P2_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
785786_14_ITEM8_P2_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
785786_14_ITEM8_P2_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
785786_14_ITEM8_P2_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
785786_14_ITEM8_P2_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
785786_14_ITEM8_P2_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
785786_14_ITEM8_P2_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
785786_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
785786_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
785786_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
785786_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

785786_14_ITEM8_P10_S3	Their products require complex configuration management, direct order fulfillment (to end customers) and global logistics management and aftermarket services.
785786_14_ITEM8_P10_S4	To service the complexities that the Company's customers' products demand, Plexus utilizes its Product Realization Value Stream, addressing its customers' products from concept to end of life.
785786_14_ITEM8_P10_S5	Consolidation Principles and Basis of Presentation:
785786_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include the accounts of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries.
785786_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
785786_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	The Company s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
785786_14_ITEM8_P11_S3	The Company also uses a 4-4-5 weekly accounting system for the interim periods in each quarter.
785786_14_ITEM8_P11_S4	Each quarter, therefore, ends on a Saturday at the end of the 4-4-5 period.
785786_14_ITEM8_P11_S5	Periodically, an additional week must be added to the fiscal year to re-align with the Saturday closest to September 30.
785786_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accounting years for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 each included 364 days.
785786_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company s reportable segments consist of the AMER, APAC and EMEA segments.
785786_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	Refer to Note 12, "Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers," for further details on reportable segments.
785786_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months and are classified as Level 1 in the fair level hierarchy described below.
785786_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	As of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 , cash and cash equivalents were the following (in thousands):
785786_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
785786_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
785786_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment.
785786_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond the Company s control.
785786_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory.
785786_14_ITEM8_P16_S2	Any actions taken by the Company s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.
785786_14_ITEM8_P16_S3	Per contractual terms, customer deposits are received by the Company to offset obsolete and excess inventory risks.
785786_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation: These assets are stated at cost.
785786_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	Depreciation, determined on the straight-line method, is based on lives assigned to the major classes of depreciable assets as follows:
785786_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Certain facilities and equipment held under capital leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the lease terms and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities.
785786_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	Lease amortization is included in depreciation expense (see Note 4, "Property, Plant and Equipment") and the financing component of the lease payments is classified as interest expense.
785786_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	For the capitalization of software costs, the Company capitalizes significant costs incurred in the acquisition or development of software for internal use.
785786_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	This includes costs of both the software and the consultants, as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees directly involved in developing internal use computer software once the final selection of the software is made.
785786_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	Costs incurred prior to the final selection of software and costs not qualifying for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
785786_14_ITEM8_P19_S3	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
785786_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups may not be recoverable through estimated future undiscounted cash flows.
785786_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a charge against current operations.
785786_14_ITEM8_P20_S2	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_14_ITEM8_P20_S3	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.
785786_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.
785786_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as program costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_14_ITEM8_P23_S2	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_14_ITEM8_P23_S3	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_14_ITEM8_P23_S4	Net sales from engineering design and development services were less than 5.0 percent of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
785786_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured products based on management s analysis of historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling.
785786_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740").
785786_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
785786_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes that would become payable upon the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
785786_14_ITEM8_P26_S3	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_14_ITEM8_P26_S4	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.
785786_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Foreign Currency Translation: The Company translates assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at year-end.
785786_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	The Company translates net sales, expenses and cash flows at the average monthly exchange rates during the respective periods.
785786_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved and remeasurement adjustments for foreign operations where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency are included in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as a component of miscellaneous income (expense).
785786_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	Exchange (losses) gains on foreign currency transactions were $(0.1) million , $(1.2) million , and $0.2 million for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
785786_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Derivatives: All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.
785786_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company periodically enters into forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
785786_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability (a fair value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge), or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.
785786_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
785786_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings as are the gains or losses related to the hedged asset or liability.
785786_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
785786_14_ITEM8_P32_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity.
785786_14_ITEM8_P32_S3	The Company's interest rate swaps and certain forward currency exchange contracts are treated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, $1.6 million , $(2.7) million and $6.8 million were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
785786_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Grants from Government Authorities: Grants from governments are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant funds will be received and the Company will comply with all attached conditions to the grant.
785786_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are recorded as an offset to the carrying value of the related assets at the time of capitalization.
785786_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	Government grants relating to other costs incurred are recognized as an offset to those related costs, for which the grants are intended to compensate for, at the time they are recognized.
785786_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Earnings Per Share: The computation of basic earnings per common share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and net income.
785786_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	The computation of diluted earnings per common share reflects additional dilution from stock options and restricted stock, excluding any with an antidilutive effect.
785786_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Stock-based Compensation: The Company measures all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, at fair value and expenses them in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company follows the established standards for reporting comprehensive income, which is defined as the changes in equity of an enterprise except those resulting from shareholder transactions.
785786_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	Accumulated other comprehensive income consists of the following as of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 (in thousands):
785786_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Refer to Note 6, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements" for further explanation regarding the change in fair value of derivative instruments, net of tax adjustment that is recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income .
785786_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company recognizes a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement.
785786_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	The liability is adjusted for any additions or deletions of related property, plant and equipment.
785786_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
785786_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
785786_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The Company holds financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, certain deferred compensation assets held under a rabbi trust arrangement, accounts payable, debt, and derivatives.
785786_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and capital lease obligations as reported in the consolidated financial statements approximate fair value.
785786_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	compensation assets held under rabbi trust arrangements are recorded at fair value.
785786_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	Accounts receivable are reflected at net realizable value based on anticipated losses due to potentially uncollectible balances.
785786_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	Anticipated losses are based on management s analysis of historical losses and changes in customers credit status.
785786_14_ITEM8_P41_S3	The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was $247.5 million and $246.8 million as of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 , respectively.
785786_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company uses quoted market prices when available or discounted cash flows to calculate fair value.
785786_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described below.
785786_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
785786_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
785786_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.
785786_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	The input levels are: Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
785786_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
785786_14_ITEM8_P45_S3	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.
785786_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	Business and Credit Concentrations: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and derivative instruments, specifically related to counterparties.
785786_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	In accordance with the Company s investment policy, the Company s cash, cash equivalents and derivative instruments were placed with recognized financial institutions.
785786_14_ITEM8_P46_S2	The Company s investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure in any one issue and the maturity date of the investment securities that typically comprise investment grade short-term debt instruments.
785786_14_ITEM8_P46_S3	The Company, at times, requires advanced cash deposits for services performed.
785786_14_ITEM8_P46_S4	The Company also closely monitors extensions of credit.
785786_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements: In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance regarding uncertainties about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern.
785786_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	The guidance requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of financial statement issuance.
785786_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	Management s assessment will be required for interim and annual periods.
785786_14_ITEM8_P47_S3	This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
785786_14_ITEM8_P47_S4	The Company is in the process of determining the date of adoption for this guidance.
785786_14_ITEM8_P47_S5	However, the Company does not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its disclosures.
785786_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance for revenue recognition.
785786_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
785786_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance.
785786_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	This may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
785786_14_ITEM8_P49_S3	This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
785786_14_ITEM8_P49_S4	Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard.
785786_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
785786_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	In April 2014, the FASB issued final guidance that changes the criteria for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation.
785786_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	The revised guidance defines a discontinued operation as (1) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of by sale, disposed of other than by sale or is classified as held for sale that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results or (2) an acquired business or nonprofit activity that is classified as held for sale on the date of acquisition.
785786_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	requirements for discontinued operations in the statement where net income is presented but does require the reclassification of assets and liabilities of a discontinued operation in the statement of financial position for all prior periods presented.
785786_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	The guidance is effective prospectively for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years, and for all businesses that, on acquisition, are classified as held for sale that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years.
785786_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in previously issued financial statements.
785786_14_ITEM8_P52_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
785786_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued new guidance for unrecognized tax benefits that exist along with a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.
785786_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	The guidance requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for an net operating loss ("NOL") carryforward, or similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward, rather than as a liability when (1) the uncertain tax position would reduce the NOL or other carryforward under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction and (2) the entity intends to use the deferred tax asset for that purpose.
785786_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	This guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
785786_14_ITEM8_P53_S3	Early adoption and retrospective application are permitted, however, the Company has not early adopted this guidance.
785786_14_ITEM8_P53_S4	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
785786_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued amended guidance for cumulative translation adjustments upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity.
785786_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	These amendments provide guidance on releasing cumulative translation adjustments when a reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity.
785786_14_ITEM8_P54_S2	In addition, these amendments provide guidance on the release of cumulative translation adjustment in partial sales of equity method investments and in step acquisitions.
785786_14_ITEM8_P54_S3	The amendments are effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
785786_14_ITEM8_P54_S4	Early adoption is permitted, however the Company has not early adopted this guidance.
785786_14_ITEM8_P54_S5	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
785786_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	Business Combination In fiscal 2012, Plexus and Kontron AG ( Kontron ) entered into a strategic manufacturing arrangement, and completed the related asset purchase transaction described below.
785786_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	Under this arrangement, Kontron transitioned all manufacturing of its Kontron Design Manufacturing Services (M) Sdn.
785786_14_ITEM8_P55_S2	Bhd. subsidiary ( KDMS ) to Plexus facilities in Penang, Malaysia.
785786_14_ITEM8_P55_S3	Plexus acquired the inventory and equipment of KDMS for $34.2 million , reflecting certain post-closing adjustments, which was paid with cash on-hand, and hired substantially all of KDMS's employees.
785786_14_ITEM8_P55_S4	No real estate was included in this transaction.
785786_14_ITEM8_P55_S5	This transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
785786_14_ITEM8_P55_S6	The purchase price was allocated primarily to inventory and equipment.

785786_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management of the Company, including its CEO and CFO, has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) (1992 framework).
785786_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on its assessment and those criteria, management has reached the conclusion that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective at the reasonable assurance level.
785786_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2014, as stated in its report included herein on page 37.
785786_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
785786_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.
785786_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
785786_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
785786_14_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
785786_14_ITEM9A_P4_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.
785786_14_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
785786_14_ITEM9A_P4_S5	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
785786_14_ITEM9A_P4_S6	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
785786_14_ITEM9A_P4_S7	Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have nonetheless reached the conclusion that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

785786_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Overview Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together Plexus, the Company, or we ) participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ( EMS ) industry.
785786_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	We deliver optimized solutions to our customers through our unique Product Realization Value Stream.
785786_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our customer-focused solutions model seamlessly integrates innovative product conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and sustaining solutions.
785786_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Plexus delivers comprehensive end-to-end solutions for customers in the Americas ( AMER ), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA ) and Asia-Pacific ( APAC ) regions.
785786_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	We provide award-winning customer service to more than 140 branded product companies in the Networking/Communications, Healthcare/Life Sciences, Industrial/Commercial and Defense/Security/Aerospace market sectors.
785786_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	Our customers have stringent quality, reliability and regulatory requirements, requiring exceptional production and supply chain agility.
785786_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	Their products require complex configuration management, direct order fulfillment (to end customers), global logistics management and Aftermarket Services.
785786_15_ITEM1_P2_S3	To service the complexities that our customers' products demand, we utilize our Product Realization Value Stream, addressing our customers products from concept to end of life.
785786_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	Plexus is passionate about being the leading EMS company in the world at servicing mid-to-low volume, higher complexity customer programs, characterized by unique flexibility, technology, quality and regulatory requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	To support and deliver on our strategy, we align our operations, processes, workforce and financial metrics to create:
785786_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Execution driven by a collaborative, customer centric culture that continuously evaluates and optimizes our business processes to support our shareholder return goals.
785786_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	We operate flexible manufacturing facilities and design our processes to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations.
785786_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	One or more uniquely configured focus factories, supported by a tailored supply chain and logistics solution, are designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness needed to support customer fulfillment requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	We accomplish our go-to-market strategy through the four market sectors we serve.
785786_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	Each sector has a market sector vice president and a business development and customer management leader who together oversee and provide leadership to teams that include business development directors, customer directors or managers, supply chain and manufacturing subject matter experts, and market sector analysts.
785786_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	These teams maintain expertise related to each market sector and execute sector strategies aligned to that market s unique quality and regulatory requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our market sector teams help define Plexus' strategy for growth with a particular focus on expanding the value-added solutions we offer customers.
785786_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our sales and marketing efforts focus on targeting new customers and expanding business with existing customers.
785786_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	We believe our ability to provide a full range of product realization services gives us a business advantage.
785786_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our financial model aligns with our business strategy.
785786_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; at the end of fiscal 2015 our estimated WACC was 11.0 percent.
785786_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	We believe economic profit is a fundamental driver of shareholder value.
785786_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Plexus measures economic profit by taking the difference between ROIC and WACC and multiplying it by invested capital.
785786_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	By exercising discipline to generate a ROIC in excess of our WACC, with focus on economic profit, our goal is to ensure that we create value for our shareholders.
785786_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, flexibility and fulfillment requirements, and complex regulatory requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs.
785786_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	The cost variance from our competitors is especially evident relative to those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics).
785786_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with many other technology pioneering start-ups or emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities.
785786_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	trends such as the level and rate of development of wired and wireless telecommunications infrastructure, communications data and data bandwidth growth, and internet usage.
785786_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	In addition to prime technology advancements, key government and policy trends impact our business, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s ( FDA ) approval of new medical devices, defense procurement practices, and other government and regulatory processes.
785786_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	Plexus may benefit from increasing outsourcing trends.
785786_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	We provide most of our optimized solutions on a turnkey basis, and we procure some or all materials required for product assembly.
785786_15_ITEM1_P12_S4	We provide select services on a consignment basis, meaning the customer supplies the necessary materials and Plexus provides the labor and other services required for product assembly.
785786_15_ITEM1_P12_S5	In addition to manufacturing, turnkey service requires material procurement and warehousing and involves greater resource investments than consignment services.
785786_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	Other than certain test equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
785786_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Established in 1979 as a Wisconsin corporation, we have approximately 14,000 full-time employees, including approximately 2,900 engineers and technologists dedicated to product development and design, test equipment development and design, and manufacturing process development and control, all of whom operate from 24 active facilities, totaling approximately 3.4 million square feet.
785786_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	Plexus' facilities are strategically located to support the global supply chain, engineering, manufacturing, and Aftermarket Service needs of customers in our targeted market sectors.
785786_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Plexus maintains a website at www.plexus.com.
785786_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	As soon as is reasonably practical, and after we electronically file or furnish all reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), we provide online copies, free of charge.
785786_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	These reports include: Proxy Statements, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Specialized Disclosure Reports on Form SD, and amendments to those reports.
785786_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	You may also access these reports at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
785786_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics is also posted on our website.

785786_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Solutions As an integrated, fully accountable partner, we deliver optimized product realization solutions that carry our customers' products from concept to end of life.
785786_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	Tailoring our Product Realization Value Stream to each product and program, Plexus provides unique solutions designed to meet the needs of each of our customers.
785786_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	As our partnerships grow and mature, we aim to engage our customers in full utilization of our Product Realization Value Stream.
785786_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	During the product development and conceptualization phases, new product ideas are created and evaluated with both the customer's and Plexus' engineering teams.
785786_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	We closely collaborate with our customers to capture their new product vision and clarify requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	Our industrial design team attempts to analyze a product through the end user's eyes focusing on ergonomics, use case research, user interface, aesthetics and evaluation mockups.
785786_15_ITEM1_P18_S3	Upon completion of concept evaluations, the Plexus team prototypes what it believes to be the most promising designs, working concurrently with engineering, manufacturing and supply chain teams.
785786_15_ITEM1_P18_S4	Future phases ensure design intent is maintained, while realizing the final product solution.
785786_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Plexus invests in the latest technology, design and automation tools to provide comprehensive design and value- engineering solutions.
785786_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	We engage with our customers in a variety of ways from supporting a short-term expansion of their engineering design capabilities to collaborating on complex, turn-key product designs.
785786_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	Our disciplined approach and structure enables significant project schedule flexibility via work-sharing across our organization.
785786_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Product design includes, but is not limited to, the following solutions:
785786_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	The commercialize phase carries significant influence with respect to converting ideas into viable products.
785786_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Commercialization starts early in the design phase and extends through manufacturing transition, often in tandem with Design for Excellence ( DFX ).
785786_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our DFX solutions encompass a wide collection of specific design solutions including design for test, design for manufacturability/assembly and design for fabrication.
785786_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	The goal of DFX is to facilitate an efficient transition from engineering to manufacturing.
785786_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	Commercialization also includes prototyping, new product introduction, design for supply chain, test development and transition management.
785786_15_ITEM1_P22_S4	We believe our commercialization solutions provide significant value by accelerating speed-to-market, reducing change activity and providing customers with a robust and manufacturable product.
785786_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Plexus applies an optimized manufacturing approach, not a one-size-fits-all model.
785786_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our scalable manufacturing solutions create flexibility for our customers through tailored supply chain solutions.
785786_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	Our focus-factory model provides a dedicated team designed to drive success that places the customer at the center of operations.
785786_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Plexus exclusively focuses on mid-to-low volume, higher-complexity programs that range from lower-level assemblies to finished electro-mechanical products.
785786_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our manufactured products typically fall into one of the following categories in our assembly spectrum:
785786_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	System and mechatronic integration products may run larger in size than other assemblies; the products range from kiosks to finished healthcare devices and life sciences equipment to other complex electro-mechanical assemblies.
785786_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	These products often combine other integrated solutions we provide and may require unique facility configurations or supply chain solutions.
785786_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Plexus offers fulfillment and logistics solutions to our customers in the forms of Direct Order Fulfillment ( DOF ), Build to Order ( BTO ) and Configure to Order ( CTO ).
785786_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Plexus receives DOF orders from our customers that provide the final specifications and configurations required by their end customers.
785786_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	Through BTO and CTO, Plexus delivers the product directly to the end customer.
785786_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	The DOF process relies on Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) systems integrating the overall supply chain, from parts procurement through manufacturing and logistics.
785786_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Plexus sustains our customers' products by providing a range of Aftermarket Services, including complex repair, refurbishment and product support for products the Company manufactures.
785786_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	In addition, we also provide customized solutions for products we did not manufacture.
785786_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	All Plexus manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to a baseline Quality Management System standard per ISO9001:2008.
785786_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	We have capabilities to assemble finished medical devices meeting FDA Quality Systems Regulation requirements and similar regulatory requirements in other countries.
785786_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	Our manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to the most current revision of the ISO 9001 standard.
785786_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	We have additional certifications and/or registrations held by certain facilities in the following regions:
785786_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Customers and Market Sectors Served Our customers range from large multinational companies to smaller emerging technology companies.
785786_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	During fiscal 2015, we served approximately 140 customers.
785786_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	We offer advanced design and production capabilities, allowing our customers to concentrate on their core competencies.
785786_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	Plexus helps accelerate our customers' time to market, reduce their investment in engineering and manufacturing capacity, and optimize total product cost.
785786_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	ARRIS Group, Inc. ( Arris ) and General Electric Company ( GE ) accounted for 12.6 percent and 10.6 percent , respectively, of our net sales during fiscal 2015 and 12.5 percent and 11.2 percent , respectively, of our net sales in fiscal 2014.
785786_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Juniper Networks, Inc. ( Juniper ), which accounted for 12.8 percent of our net sales in fiscal 2013, disengaged from Plexus in fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	Other than Arris and GE in fiscal 2015 and 2014, and Juniper in fiscal 2013, no other customer accounted for 10.0 percent or more of our net sales in those fiscal years.
785786_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays, modifications and transitions.
785786_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers.
785786_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Customers' forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions.
785786_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations.
785786_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	The loss of any major customer could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.
785786_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	In addition, as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector.
785786_15_ITEM1_P33_S4	Many of our large customers contract with us through independent multiple divisions, subsidiaries, production facilities or locations.
785786_15_ITEM1_P33_S5	We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others.
785786_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 is shown in the following table:
785786_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Although our current business development focus is based on our targeted market sectors, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources geographically (see Note 11 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments).
785786_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	Plexus offers a uniform array of services for customers in each market sector and we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources to particular market sectors, nor internally track our costs and resources per market sector.
785786_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Materials and Suppliers We typically purchase raw materials, including PCBs and electronic components, from manufacturers and distributors.
785786_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Under certain circumstances, we will purchase components from brokers, customers or competitors.
785786_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	The key electronic components we purchase include: specialized components (such as application-specific integrated circuits), semiconductors, interconnect products, electronic subassemblies (including memory modules, power supply modules and cable and wire harnesses), inductors, resistors and capacitors.
785786_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	We also purchase non-electronic, typically custom engineered, components used in manufacturing and higher-level assembly.
785786_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	These components include molded/formed plastics, sheet metal fabrications, aluminum extrusions, robotics, motors, vision sensors, motion/actuation, fluidics, displays, die castings and various other hardware and fastener components.
785786_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	These components are sourced from both Plexus preferred suppliers and customer directed suppliers.
785786_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	Components range from standard to highly customized and vary widely in terms of market availability and price.
785786_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	Component shortages and subsequent allocations by our suppliers are an inherent risk to the electronics industry, and have particularly been an issue for us and the industry from time to time.
785786_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	We discuss the causes of these shortages more fully in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A herein.
785786_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	We actively manage our business to minimize our exposure to material and component shortages.
785786_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Plexus global supply chain management organization attempts to create strong supplier alliances and ensure a steady flow of components and products at competitive prices.
785786_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	We strive to achieve these goals through advanced supply chain solutions we develop in partnership with our customers, risk management tools and global expediting processes.
785786_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Plexus can often influence the selection of new product components throughout the design phase of the Product Realization Value Stream.
785786_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Competition Plexus operates in a highly competitive market, with a goal to be best-in-class at meeting the unique needs of our customers.
785786_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	We provide flexible solutions, timely order fulfillment, and strong engineering, testing and production capabilities.
785786_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	A number of competitors may provide electronics manufacturing and engineering services similar to Plexus.
785786_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	Others may be more established in certain industry sectors, or have greater financial, manufacturing or marketing resources.
785786_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	Smaller competitors compete mainly in specific sectors and within limited geographic areas.
785786_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	Plexus occasionally competes with in-house capabilities of current and potential customers.
785786_15_ITEM1_P43_S4	Plexus maintains awareness and knowledge of our competitors' capabilities, in order to remain highly competitive within the broad scope of the EMS industry.
785786_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	We own various service marks that we use in our business, which are registered in the trademark offices of the United States and other countries.
785786_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Although we own certain patents, they are not currently material to our business.
785786_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	We do not have any material copyrights.
785786_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our integrated ERP, warehouse management and shop floor control systems serve all of our manufacturing sites, providing a core set of consistent, global business applications.
785786_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	This consistency augments our other management information systems, allowing us to standardize our ability to translate data from multiple production facilities into operational and financial information.
785786_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	The related software licenses are of a general commercial character on terms customary for these types of agreements.
785786_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Environmental Compliance We are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to air emission standards and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process.
785786_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state and foreign environmental laws and do not anticipate any significant expenditures in maintaining our compliance; however, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
785786_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Social Responsibility Plexus is committed to social responsibility throughout our global business operations.
785786_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our commitment to social responsibility extends to human rights, labor practices, the environment, worker health and safety, fair operating practices and the Company s social impact in the communities where we operate.
785786_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	We consider a variety of standards for socially responsible practices, including local and federal legal requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate, the International Organization for Standardization s Guidance on Social Responsibility (ISO 26000) and standards established by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (the "EICC").
785786_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	Plexus is an applicant member of the EICC.

785786_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Employees We make a considerable effort to maintain a highly-qualified and engaged work force.
785786_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	We have been able to offer enhanced career opportunities to many of our employees.
785786_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our human resources department identifies career objectives and monitors specific skill development opportunities for employees with potential for advancement.
785786_15_ITEM1_P49_S3	We invest at all levels of the organization to ensure that employees are well trained and qualified for their positions.
785786_15_ITEM1_P49_S4	We have a policy of involvement and consultation with employees at every facility and strive for continuous improvement at all levels.
785786_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	We employ approximately 14,000 full-time employees.
785786_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Given the quick response times required by our customers, we seek to maintain flexibility to scale our operations as necessary to maximize efficiency.
785786_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	To do so we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees.
785786_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	Approximately 251 and 494 of our employees are covered by union agreements in the United Kingdom and Mexico, respectively.
785786_15_ITEM1_P50_S4	These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year, although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years.
785786_15_ITEM1_P50_S5	Our employees in China, Germany, Malaysia, Romania and the United States are not covered by union agreements.
785786_15_ITEM1_P50_S6	We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities, and we believe that our employee relationships are generally positive and stable.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions and world events.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose any of these customers or if there are challenges in those market sectors, our net sales and operating results could decline significantly.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ten largest customers accounted for 56.1 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2015 , and 55.1 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	During fiscal years ended October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 , there were two customers that each represented 10.0 percent or more of our net sales.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our principal customers may vary from period to period, and our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all, particularly given the volatile nature of certain programs.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We have experienced from time to time, and in the future may experience, significant customer or program disengagements and the end of life of significant programs.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Especially given our discrete number of customers, significant reductions in net sales to any of our major customers, the loss of major customers or our failure to make appropriate choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business and results of operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S7	In addition, we focus our sales efforts on customers in only a few market sectors.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Economic, business and/or regulatory conditions that affect the sector, or the Company s failure to choose appropriate sectors, can particularly impact Plexus.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S10	For instance, sales in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector are substantially affected by trends in the healthcare industry, such as government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the financial health of, and pending changes in the structure of, the U.S. health care sector generally, including as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Affordable Care Act").
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Further, potential reductions in U.S. government agency spending, including those due to budget cuts or other political developments or issues, could affect opportunities in all of our market sectors.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Any weakness in our customers' end markets could affect our business and results of operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S13	We rely on timely and regular payments from our customers; therefore, deterioration in the payment experience with or credit quality of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P2_S14	The inability or failure of our major customers to meet their obligations to us or their bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	From time to time, our customers, including formerly significant customers, have been affected by merger and acquisition activity.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	While these transactions may present Plexus with opportunities to capture new business, they also create the risk that these customers will partially or completely disengage as a result of transitioning such business to Plexus' competitors or deciding to manufacture the products internally.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Plexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and currency risks.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We have operations in many countries; operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate represent a majority of our net sales and operating income, with a particular concentration in Malaysia.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, a significant amount of our cash balances are currently held outside of the U.S.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	These international aspects of our operations, which are likely to increase over time, subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results:
785786_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	potential disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access cash amounts held outside of the U.S.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	regulatory requirements and potential changes to those requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We continue to monitor our risk associated with foreign currency translation and have entered into limited forward contracts to address this risk.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As our international operations expand, our failure to appropriately address foreign currency transactions and/or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, developments affecting particular countries can adversely affect our ability to access cash or other assets held in such countries.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A significant portion of our operations currently occurs in, and cash balances are held in, the APAC region, particularly in Malaysia.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The concentration of our operations, assets and profitability in that region exposes us to adverse developments, economic, political or otherwise, in those countries.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties, tariffs or taxes, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	For example, our facility in Mexico operates under the Mexican Maquiladora ("IMMEX") program.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations; we could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Compliance with trade agreements could, among other effects, lead to increased personnel expenses or subject Plexus to additional requirements related to environmental, health and safety matters.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our customers do not make long-term commitments and may cancel or change their production requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Companies in our industry must respond quickly to the requirements of their customers in both design and production.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Customers also cancel requirements, change engineering or other service requirements, change production quantities, delay production or revise their forecasts for a number of reasons that are beyond our control.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our working capital levels.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred from time to time and may continue to occur in the future.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers requirements, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital management, facility and capacity requirements, personnel needs and other resource requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The short-term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate their future requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Since many of our operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our operating results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Moreover, since our margins vary across customers and specific programs, a reduction in demand with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Rapid increases in customer requirements may stress personnel and other capacity resources.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We may not have sufficient resources at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program, which could result in a loss of business from such customers.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We have a complex business model, and our failure to properly manage or execute on that model, as well as maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise, could adversely affect our operations, financial results and reputation.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our business model focuses on products and services in the mid-to-lower-volume, higher-complexity segment of our industry.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our customers products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility, in some cases necessitating optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solutions across an integrated global platform.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The products we manufacture are also typically complex, heavily regulated, and require complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, we offer Aftermarket Services to our customers, which add to the complexity of our business model.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Our business model requires a great degree of attention, flexibility and resources.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	These resources include working capital, management and technical personnel, and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse manufacturing, regulatory and service requirements for multiple programs of varying sizes simultaneously, including in multiple locations and geographies.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We also depend on securing and ramping new customers and programs and on transitioning production for new customers and programs, which creates added complexities related to managing the start-up risks of such projects, especially for companies that did not previously outsource such activities.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The complexity of our service model, which encompasses a broad range of services including conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and Aftermarket Services, often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations as well as commitments from us to our customers.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If we fail to meet those obligations, it could result in claims against us and/or adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If we fail to effectively manage or execute our business model, we may lose customer confidence and our reputation may suffer.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The Company s reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to maintain or expand business opportunities could be impaired and our financial results could suffer on a going-forward basis.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Many of the markets for our manufacturing, engineering, aftermarket and other services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process developments.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our internal processes are also subject to these factors.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The continued success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to:
785786_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will maintain or develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The emergence of new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, we may have to acquire new design, assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment, and the offering of new or additional services to our customers, may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	to maintain our personnel and other resources during times of fluctuating demand, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our products and services are for end markets that require technologically advanced products.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Factors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve could adversely affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	the potential failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Even if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business relationships with them and our production for, or services offered to, them, can affect our production cycles, inventory management and results of operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs, or the provision of new services, could affect our operations and financial results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new programs or types of services (including expansion of our Aftermarket Services capabilities) for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to opportunities.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We must initially determine whether it would be in our interests from a business perspective to pursue a particular potential new customer, program or service, including evaluating the customer s, program s and/or service s fit with our value proposition as well as its potential end-market success.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If we make the decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the anticipated costs, risks and rewards.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The failure to make prudent engagement decisions and/or to establish appropriate terms of engagement could adversely affect our profitability and margins.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	service s anticipated revenue; these factors can sometimes extend for a significant period.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Some new programs or services require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and competencies.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We may not meet customer expectations, which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver conforming product or services on a timely basis.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market acceptance, regulatory approvals and/or economic conditions.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute on a new program s or service s requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In recent years, our revenue growth has been more heavily dependent on ramping new program wins as compared to end-market growth of mature programs.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The management of resources in connection with the establishment of new or recent programs and customer relationships, as well as program transfers between facilities and geographies, and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross and operating margins and level of working capital.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life-cycle of new programs, which typically lack a track record of order volume and timing as well as production efficiencies in the early stages.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We typically manage multiple new programs at any given time; therefore, we are exposed to these factors in varying magnitudes.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, if any of these programs or customer relationships were terminated, our operating results could be negatively impacted, particularly in the short-term.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations and geographies.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We conduct these transfers on a regular basis to meet customer needs, seek long-term efficiencies or respond to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Although we try to minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between our facilities and geographies, there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P22_S7	While these factors tend to affect new, recent or transferred programs, they can also impact more mature, or maturing programs and customer relationships, especially programs where end-market demand can be somewhat volatile.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction to adjust to customers needs and market demands.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, as well as fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these decisions, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Expansion and consolidation, including the transfer of operations to larger facilities or acquisitions, can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	For example, in fiscal 2014, we opened new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. (Neenah, Wisconsin) and in Mexico (Guadalajara) to replace existing facilities in those countries.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In early fiscal 2016, we announced the planned closure of our Fremont, California facility.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If we are unable to effectively manage our recent or future expansions and consolidations, or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, we may expand our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Other risks of current or future expansions, acquisitions and consolidations include:
785786_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the expansion.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entail short-term costs, reductions in capacity and/or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	When we make decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring charges, as we did in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 in connection with the replacement of facilities in the U.S. and Mexico.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In addition, to meet our customers needs, particularly when the production requirements of certain products are site-specific, or to achieve increased efficiencies, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Since customers needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P26_S7	We may also encounter situations where our lack of a physical presence in certain locations may limit or foreclose opportunities.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P26_S8	Changes in tax laws, potential tax disputes, negative or unforeseen tax consequences and/or further developments affecting our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Given the scope of our international operations and our international tax arrangements, proposed and potential changes to the manner in which U.S.-based multinational companies are taxed in the U.S. could have a material impact on our operating results and competitiveness.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P26_S10	In addition, other recently adopted or potential changes to tax laws in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. in which we operate could also affect our results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The Company has been granted tax holidays (including for its Malaysian subsidiary) and is eligible for various tax credits and rebates (domestically and internationally), which are generally subject to certain conditions and other requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	While we expect to comply with such conditions and requirements, we would experience adverse tax consequences, or may not be able to receive the related benefits, if we do not effectively comply.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income by jurisdiction.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in each of our jurisdictions may require the creation of an additional valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	An inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, may adversely affect our business and reputation.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a global company with a complex business model, we are heavily dependent on our information systems to support our customers requirements and to successfully manage our business.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to system and data security, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our information systems, like those of other companies, are susceptible to malicious damage, intrusions and outages due to, among other events, viruses, industrial espionage (internal or external), break-ins and similar events, other breaches of security, natural disasters, power loss or telecommunications failures.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency, redundancy and recovery processes, as well as by securing insurance; however, these measures may be inadequate.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Any operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of our and/or our customers financial, product or other confidential information, result in adverse regulatory actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P31_S4	We and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations and industry standards; a failure to comply with current and future regulations and standards could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We are subject to extensive government regulation and industry standards (as well as customer-specific standards) relating to the products we design and manufacture as well as how we conduct our business, including regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support and many other facets of our operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	A failure to comply with such regulations or standards could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	As a publicly-held company, we are subject to increasingly stringent laws, regulations and other requirements, including those affecting, among other areas, our accounting, internal controls, corporate governance practices, securities disclosures and reporting.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly aggressive in adopting and enforcing anti-corruption laws.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, among others, apply to us and our operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Affordable Care Act significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the U.S. and is expected to impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance and/or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is subject to statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety, including Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulations and similar regulations in other countries.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Failure to comply with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of devices, or total or partial suspension of production.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We also design and manufacture products for customers in the defense, security and aerospace industries.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	State, Department of Commerce, Federal Aviation Authority, and other governmental agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries, and also under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In addition, whenever we pursue business in new sectors and subsectors, or our customers pursue new technologies or markets, we need to navigate the potentially heavy regulatory and legislative burdens of such sectors, technologies or markets.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	For example, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, as well as the financial health of health care providers, and pending changes in how health care in the U.S. is structured, including as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in this sector as well as impact our margins.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Our customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards, including many of the industry-specific regulations discussed above.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our customers' failure to comply could affect their businesses, which in turn would affect our sales to them.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In addition, if our customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs for these customers and create inefficiencies in our business.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	A failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, and third party certification requirements or standards, including those related to social responsibility, could adversely affect our business and reputation.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P40_S6	In addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own social responsibility, conflict minerals, quality or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Such policies or standards may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third party organizations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Company is an Applicant Member of the EICC.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The EICC is a non-profit coalition of electronics companies and establishes standards for its members in responsible and ethical practices in the areas of labor, environmental compliance, employee health and safety, ethics and social responsibility.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Our compliance with these policies, standards and third party certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, our adoption of these standards could adversely affect our cost competiveness, ability to provide customers with required service levels and ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	There may be problems with the products we design or manufacture that could result in liability claims against us, reduced demand for our services and damage to our reputation.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The products that we design and/or manufacture may be subject to liability or claims in the event that defects are discovered or alleged.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We design and manufacture products to our customers specifications, many of which are highly complex, and produce products for industries, such as health care, defense and aerospace, that tend to have higher risk profiles.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the design and/or manufacturing of these products, including as a result of business continuity issues.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Whether or not we are responsible, problems in the products we manufacture, whether real or alleged, whether caused by faulty customer specifications, the design or manufacturing processes or a component defect, may result in delayed shipments to customers and/or reduced or canceled customer orders.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S5	In addition, problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S6	These potential claims may include damages for the recall of a product and/or injury to person or property.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S7	Even if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S8	While we seek to insure against many of these risks, insurance coverage may be inadequate, not cost effective or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products or issues.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S9	We occasionally incur costs defending claims, and any such disputes could adversely affect our business relationships.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S10	Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S11	Our design and manufacturing services and the products offered by our customers involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S12	In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P42_S13	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Infringement by our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and disrupt our production.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Additionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products, and could affect our customer relationships more broadly.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and components upon which we rely.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Increased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We compete against numerous providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of designing and manufacturing products internally and may choose to design and/or manufacture products themselves rather than outsource such activities.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Consolidations and other changes in our industry may result in a changing competitive landscape.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Some of our competitors have a larger geographic footprint than we do, in addition to substantially greater managerial, manufacturing, engineering, technical, financial, systems, sales and marketing resources.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	be better positioned to compete on price for their services.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may operate at a cost disadvantage compared to our competitors that have lower internal cost structures or greater direct buying power with component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or become increasingly competitive.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or loss of market share.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our manufacturing services involve inventory risk.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Most of our contract manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts and/or orders.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	A customer s cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Engineering changes by a customer may result in obsolete materials or components.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory and require customers to reimburse us for these items, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or be able to collect on these obligations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Excess or obsolete inventory, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P49_S3	In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P49_S4	These managed inventory programs result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to the risk of enforcing those obligations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P49_S6	We may experience raw material and component shortages and price fluctuations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P49_S7	We generally do not have long-term supply agreements.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P49_S8	We have experienced, and in the future may experience, raw material and component shortages due to supplier capacity constraints or their failure to deliver.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P49_S9	We also could experience disruptions in energy supplies.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P49_S10	Such constraints can also be caused by world events, such as government policies, terrorism, armed conflict, natural disasters, economic recession and other localized events.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used in the assembly process and, in some cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular raw material or component.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	difficulties or business continuity issues that could preclude them from delivering raw materials or components timely or at all.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Supply shortages and delays in deliveries of raw materials or components have in some cases resulted in delayed production of assemblies, which have increased our inventory levels and adversely affected our operating results in certain periods.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	An inability to obtain sufficient inventory on a timely basis could also harm relationships with our customers.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	In addition, raw materials and components that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Certain materials provided to us may be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S5	The need to obtain replacement materials and parts may negatively affect our manufacturing operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S6	The inadvertent use of any such parts or products may also give rise to liability claims.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S7	Raw material and component supply shortages and delays in deliveries can also result in increased pricing.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S8	While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in raw material or component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S9	Conversely, as a result of our pricing strategies and practices, raw material and component price reductions have contributed positively to our operating results in the past.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S10	Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S11	We depend on our workforce, including certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel or other personnel disruptions, including the inability to hire and retain sufficient personnel, may harm our business.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S12	Our success depends in large part on the continued services of our key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, particularly highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of products.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S13	The competition for these individuals is significant, and the loss of key employees could harm our business.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S14	From time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, promotions, transitions, disability, death and other terminations of service that affect our executive officers and other key employees.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S15	Transitions or other changes in responsibilities among officers and key employees, particularly those that are unplanned, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, which could have an effect on our results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S16	We also depend on good relationships with our workforce generally.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S17	Any disruption in our relationships with our personnel, including as a result of potential union organizing activities, work actions or other labor issues, could substantially affect our operations and results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S18	In addition, when we expand operations in either existing areas or new locations, including internationally, we need to attract and retain the services of sufficient qualified personnel to conduct those operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S19	If we fail to retain and maintain sufficient qualified personnel, the operations at those locations, and consequently our financial results, could be adversely affected.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P51_S20	In new or existing facilities we may be subject to local labor practices or union activities, wage pressure and changing wage requirements, increasing health care costs, differing employment laws and regulations in various countries, local competition for employees, restrictions on labor mobility as well as high turnover, and other issues affecting our workforce, all of which could affect operations at particular locations, which also could have adverse effects on our operational results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	As noted above, our adoption of certain third-party standards could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Natural disasters, breaches of security and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis and floods.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P52_S3	All facilities are subject to other natural or man-made disasters such as those related to global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism or war, breaches of security, theft or espionage, and failures of utilities.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P52_S4	If such an event was to occur, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P52_S6	In addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P52_S7	If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P52_S8	Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and thus negatively affect our relationships and financial results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Although we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to physical security, we remain at risk of unauthorized access to our facilities and the possible unauthorized use or theft of inventory, information or other physical assets.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If unauthorized persons gain physical access to our facilities, or our physical assets or information are stolen or used in an unauthorized manner (whether through outside theft or industrial espionage), we could be subject to, among other consequences, negative publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, loss of government contracts, litigation by affected parties and/or other future financial obligations related to the loss, misuse or theft of our or our customers' data, inventory or physical assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We may fail to secure or maintain necessary additional financing and/or capital.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We cannot be certain that our existing credit facilities will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	In addition, if we do not comply with the covenants under our credit agreement, our ability to borrow under that facility would be adversely affected.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In addition, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit agreement and our interest rate swap agreements, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations, either due to instability in the global financial markets or otherwise.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P54_S5	In early fiscal 2016, we exercised a portion of the accordion feature under our revolving credit facility to increase its capacity by $30 million to $265 million.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P54_S6	We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining new facilities, or through a combination of these methods.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P54_S7	We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P54_S8	If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders ownership interests; we may not be able to offer our securities on attractive or acceptable terms in the event of volatility or weakness in our stock price.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P54_S9	Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any current or future financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P54_S10	We may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions, as well as strategic arrangements, and may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or recognize the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We have previously grown, in part, through acquisitions and strategic arrangements.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions or similar transactions, this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	These risks include: Operating risks, such as:
785786_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	the loss of key employees of acquired businesses.
785786_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	the unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses.
785786_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facilities comprise an integrated network of engineering and manufacturing centers with our corporate headquarters located in Neenah, Wisconsin.
785786_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own or lease active facilities with approximately 3.4 million square feet of capacity.
785786_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	This includes approximately 1.6 million square feet in AMER, approximately 1.4 million square feet in APAC and approximately 0.4 million square feet in EMEA.
785786_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	Our facilities as of October 3, 2015 , are described in the following table:
785786_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) The facilities in Penang, Malaysia; Xiamen, China; and Buffalo Grove, Illinois include more than one building.
785786_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	In November 2015, Plexus announced its intention to close the Fremont, California facility and transition the customer programs to other facilities by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016.
785786_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	(3) The facility in San Diego, California is subleased and is no longer used in operations.
785786_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	The lease on this facility expires in fiscal 2016.
785786_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is party to certain lawsuits and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
785786_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management does not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
785786_15_ITEM4_P0_S0	Executive Officers See Part III, Item 10, "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance," of this Form 10-K for information regarding the Company's executive officers.
785786_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market Price per Share The Company s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market in the NASDAQ Global Select Market tier.
785786_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	The price information below represents high and low sale prices of our common stock for each quarterly period during fiscal 2015 and 2014 :
785786_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total return on Plexus common stock with the NASDAQ Stock Market Index for U.S. Companies and the NASDAQ Stock Market Index for Electronic Components Companies, both of which include Plexus.
785786_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	The values on the graph show the relative performance of an investment of $100 made on October 1, 2010, in Plexus common stock and in each of the indices as of the last business day of the respective fiscal year.
785786_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	Shareholders of Record; Dividends As of November 16, 2015, there were 498 shareholders of record.
785786_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	We have not paid any cash dividends in the past.
785786_15_ITEM5_P2_S2	We currently anticipate that the majority of earnings in the foreseeable future will be retained to finance the development of our business and our authorized share repurchases.
785786_15_ITEM5_P2_S3	However, the Company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include additional share repurchases, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_15_ITEM5_P2_S4	See also Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources, for a discussion of the Company s intentions regarding dividends, and loan covenants which could restrict dividend payments.
785786_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table provides the specified information about the repurchases of shares by the Company during the three months ended October 3, 2015 :
785786_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	(1) On August 13, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock during fiscal 2015.
785786_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	The Company repurchased 745,227 shares under this program for $30.0 million at an average price of $40.26 per share.
785786_15_ITEM5_P4_S2	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_15_ITEM5_P4_S3	On August 20, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock during fiscal 2016.
785786_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) During fiscal 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded $1.7 million and $11.3 million, respectively, in restructuring and impairment charges, which are included in operating income.
785786_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	These charges largely related to the Company's consolidation of its manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin, as well as its relocation of manufacturing operations from Juarez, Mexico to Guadalajara, Mexico.
785786_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	(2) The Company defines return on invested capital as tax-effected operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period.
785786_15_ITEM6_P1_S1	(3) In fiscal 2012, the Company established a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets resulting in an additional tax provision of approximately $20.6 million ($22.8 million provision, offset by $2.2 million recorded to other comprehensive income) and a decrease in diluted earnings per share of $0.64.
785786_15_ITEM6_P1_S2	Return on invested capital excludes the $20.6 million net deferred tax asset reduction.
785786_15_ITEM6_P1_S3	An additional $1.3 million of valuation allowance established for fiscal 2012 relates to operating losses in Germany and Romania, making the total valuation allowance for that year $24.1 million.
785786_15_ITEM6_P1_S4	(4) Fiscal 2015 included 53 weeks.
785786_15_ITEM6_P1_S5	All other periods presented included 52 weeks.

785786_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	The following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A herein.
785786_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Performance Summary.
785786_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions, except per share data):
785786_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2015 increased $276.0 million , or 11.6 percent , as compared to fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	The net sales increase was primarily the result of increases across all market sectors.
785786_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	The most significant net sales increases were from the industrial/commercial and networking/communications sectors, which increased by $102.0 million and $82.0 million , respectively.
785786_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	However, we began to experience a softening in these sectors during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, which we expect will continue through the first half of fiscal 2016.
785786_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2014 increased $150.2 million, or 6.7 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	The net sales increase was primarily the result of a $134.1 million increase in net sales in the healthcare/life sciences sector, as well as net sales increases in the industrial/commercial and defense/security/aerospace sectors, partially offset by a reduction in net sales in the networking/communication sector.
785786_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	The reduction in the networking/communications sector resulted from a $282.6 million headwind related to the disengagement of Juniper Networks, Inc. ("Juniper") in fiscal 2013, partially offset by a $230.3 million increase in net sales to two key customers in that sector primarily resulting from new product ramps.
785786_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our net sales by market sector for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in millions):
785786_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the networking/communications sector increased $82.0 million , or 10.8 percent , as compared to fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	The change was primarily the result of a $50.1 million increase in net sales to a key customer as a result of increased end-market demand, a $36.1 million increase in net sales from one of our largest customers as a result of new product ramps and expansion of its end-market demand, and a $16.0 million increase related to a new customer.
785786_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	Additionally, five customers' net sales increased $37.5 million, in aggregate, primarily as a result of increased end-market demand as well as new program ramps.
785786_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	These increases were partially offset by a $19.8 million decrease due to a customer that experienced softening in its end-market demand, a $10.6 million decrease related to a customer disengagement and several other customers with decreased end-market demand.
785786_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the networking/communications sector decreased $63.8 million, or 7.7 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	The change was primarily the result of a $282.6 million decrease in net sales to Juniper, related to its disengagement, partially offset by a $230.3 million increase in sales related to two key customers in this sector primarily resulting from new program ramps.
785786_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the healthcare/life sciences sector increased $52.9 million , or 7.6 percent , as compared to fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	The increase was primarily due to $39.6 million of new program ramps for one customer, and increased end-market demand and new program ramps across several other customers in this sector.
785786_15_ITEM7_P8_S4	The increase was partially offset by a program loss for one customer, which resulted in a decrease of $14.6 million, and decreased net sales to several other customers as a result of program ramp downs and decreased end-market demand.
785786_15_ITEM7_P8_S5	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the healthcare/life sciences sector increased $134.1 million, or 23.8 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P8_S6	The increase was primarily due to $89.3 million of new program ramps and increased end-market demand for two key customers in this sector, and increased end-market demand and new program ramps across several other customers in this sector.
785786_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the industrial/commercial sector increased $102.0 million , or 17.5 percent , as compared to fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	The increase was primarily due to a $45.6 million increase in net sales to a new customer in fiscal 2015, a $36.8 million increase related to new programs with existing customers, a $24.4 million increase related to new customers secured in fiscal 2014 that ramped in fiscal 2015, and several other customers with increased end-market demand.
785786_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	These increases were partially offset by a $22.1 million decrease due to the disengagement of a customer as a result of the inability to reach contractual terms, and several other customers with decreased end-market demand.
785786_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the industrial/commercial sector increased $32.5 million, or 5.9 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P9_S4	The increase was primarily the result of the expansion of business with one of our larger customers in the sector, which accounted for $30.7 million of the increased net sales as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P9_S5	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the defense/security/aerospace sector increased $39.2 million , or 11.7 percent , as compared to fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P9_S6	The increase was primarily driven by new program ramps and increased end-market demand spread among multiple customers.
785786_15_ITEM7_P9_S7	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the defense/security/aerospace sector increased $47.4 million, or 16.5 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P9_S8	The increase was primarily due to $37.5 million resulting from new program ramps and increased end-market demand for one of our larger customers in the sector.
785786_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	As a percentage of consolidated net sales, net sales attributable to customers representing 10 percent or more of consolidated net sales as well as the percentage of net sales attributable to our ten largest customers for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , were as follows:
785786_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Gross profit for fiscal 2015 increased $14.0 million , or 6.2 percent , as compared to fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Gross profit increased $28.4 million primarily as a result of increased sales.
785786_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	This was partially offset by a $14.4 million increase in fixed costs primarily in the AMER region as a result of continued investments in our new manufacturing facilities in Neenah, Wisconsin and Guadalajara, Mexico and costs incurred related to production process constraints in a defense/security/aerospace focus factory.
785786_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	Gross margin decreased to 9.0 percent from 9.5 percent .
785786_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	The largest driver of the decrease in gross margin percentage from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was a lower net parts contribution margin and lower labor contribution margin, offset by lower fixed costs as a percentage of sales.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	We have made additional investments in new manufacturing facilities with expected efficiencies and productivity improvements yet to be realized.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Gross profit for fiscal 2014 increased $12.4 million, or 5.8 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	Overall gross margin decreased to 9.5 percent from 9.6 percent.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	Gross profit increased $34.2 million primarily as a result of increased sales.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S4	This favorable effect was largely offset by a $21.9 million increase in fixed costs due to our investment in a new manufacturing facility in Neenah, Wisconsin, the ramp up of new business in the AMER region, and increased depreciation and personnel expenses with our then new manufacturing facility in Oradea, Romania.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S5	Operating income for fiscal 2015 increased $14.8 million as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of the increase in gross profit previously discussed and a $9.6 million decrease in restructuring and impairment charges, which were higher in fiscal 2014 because they largely related to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin, and the relocation of manufacturing operations from Juarez, Mexico to Guadalajara.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S6	This was partially offset by an $8.7 million increase in selling and administrative expenses ("S A") primarily due to increased variable compensation expense, higher compensation expense due to increased headcount and an increase in professional services expense.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S7	Operating margin increased to 4.3 percent for fiscal 2015 from 4.2 percent for fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S8	Operating income for fiscal 2014 increased $4.0 million as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S9	A $2.9 million decrease in S A as compared to prior year and the previously discussed increase to gross profit were partially offset by $11.3 million of restructuring and impairment charges previously discussed.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S10	As a result, operating margin decreased to 4.2 percent for fiscal 2014 from 4.3 percent for fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S11	Other expense for fiscal 2015 increased $1.9 million as compared to fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S12	The increase in other expense for fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of a $1.7 million increase in interest expense due to higher average borrowings, a $0.8 million increase in miscellaneous expense due to fiscal 2014 having benefited from a favorable non-recurring accrual related to the termination of an agreement for additional land in Hangzhou, China, and an additional $1.4 million increase in miscellaneous expense.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S13	This was partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in foreign exchange gains and a $0.6 million increase in interest income due to an increase of cash and cash equivalents.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S14	Other expense for fiscal 2014 decreased $4.4 million as compared to fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P12_S15	The decrease in other expense for fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of a $1.3 million increase in interest income, a $1.1 million decrease in currency exchange losses, a $0.8 million decrease in miscellaneous expense due to the favorable outcome related to a previous accrual for expenses related to Hangzhou as discussed above, and a $0.3 million decrease in interest expense.
785786_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Income tax expense and effective annual income tax rates, with and without the annual valuation allowance, for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	*The Company believes the non-GAAP presentation of income tax expense (benefit) and effective annual tax rate excluding the impact of the valuation allowance provides additional insight over the comparative reporting periods.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Income tax expense for fiscal 2015 was $12.0 million compared to $6.1 million for fiscal 2014 and $2.7 million for fiscal 2013 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Company's effective annual tax rates vary from the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0% primarily as a result of the mix of earnings from U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and a tax holiday granted to a subsidiary located in the APAC region where the Company derives a significant portion of its earnings.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings and tax benefits of $3.8 million primarily due to the lapse of statute of limitations related to certain U.S. tax examinations during fiscal 2014.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was higher than the effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S4	During fiscal 2015, the Company recorded a $17.5 million addition to its valuation allowance relating to continuing losses in certain jurisdictions within the AMER and EMEA regions.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S5	As of October 3, 2015 , using the measurement criteria found in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"), the Company believes that the positive evidence does not outweigh the negative and the valuation allowance should remain in place.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S6	During fiscal 2014, the Company recorded a $7.9 million addition to its valuation allowance related to continuing losses in certain jurisdictions within the AMER and EMEA regions.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S7	During fiscal 2014, as noted above, the Company also recorded tax benefits of $3.8 million primarily due to the lapse of statute of limitations related to certain U.S. tax examinations during the fiscal year.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S8	During fiscal 2013, the Company recorded a $7.0 million addition to its valuation allowance, of which $5.2 million related to continuing losses in certain jurisdictions within the AMER and EMEA regions.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S9	During fiscal 2013, the Company performed an analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, regarding the need for a valuation allowance against its U.K. deferred tax assets, consistent with the provisions of ASC 740.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S10	Accordingly, the Company established an additional $1.8 million valuation allowance against the U.K. deferred tax assets.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S11	During fiscal 2013 the Company also identified and recorded several out-of-period tax errors that reduced tax expense by $3.2 million.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S12	The Company believes these out-of-period tax errors were not material to the fiscal 2013, or previously issued, financial statements.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S13	The Company has been granted a tax holiday for a foreign subsidiary operating in the APAC region.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S14	This tax holiday will expire on December 31, 2024, and is subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S15	The Company benefited from a second tax holiday within the APAC region until December 31, 2013, when it expired under the terms of the Company's agreement with the local taxing authority.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S16	In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, these holidays resulted in tax reductions of approximately $29.9 million ($0.89 per basic share), $24.1 million ($0.71 per basic share), and $22.7 million ($0.66 per basic share), respectively.
785786_15_ITEM7_P15_S17	The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be approximately 12.0 to 14.0 percent.
785786_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Net income for fiscal 2015 increased $7.1 million , or 8.2 percent , to $94.3 million from fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Net income increased primarily as a result of increased gross profit and lower restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by an increase in S A expenses, interest expense and an increase in income tax expense, as discussed previously.
785786_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Net income, both including and excluding the annual valuation allowance and out-of-period tax adjustments (in fiscal 2013), for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	*The Company believes the non-GAAP presentation of net income excluding the impact of the valuation allowance and out-of-period tax adjustments provides additional insight over the comparative reporting periods.
785786_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Net income for fiscal 2014 increased $5.0 million, or 6.0 percent, to $87.2 million from fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Net income increased primarily as a result of increased gross profit and lower S A expenses, partially offset by increased restructuring and impairment charges and increased income tax expense, as discussed previously.
785786_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.74 for fiscal 2015 from $2.52 for fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of increased net income.
785786_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Further improvement was attributable to the positive impact of fewer weighted average outstanding shares in fiscal 2015 due to our common stock repurchase program.
785786_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	See Note 13, "Shareholders' Equity" in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's stock repurchase programs.
785786_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.52, or 6.8 percent, for fiscal 2014 from $2.36 for fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of increased net income.
785786_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	Further improvement was due to the positive impact of fewer weighted average outstanding shares in fiscal 2014 due to our common stock repurchase program.
785786_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	See Note 13, "Shareholders' Equity" in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's stock repurchase programs.
785786_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Return on Invested Capital ( ROIC ).
785786_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	We use a 5-5 financial model which is aligned with our business strategy, and includes a ROIC goal of 500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ), which we refer to as "Economic Return," and a 5.0 percent operating margin target.
785786_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Our primary focus is on our Economic Return goal of 5.0 percent, which is designed to create shareholder value and generate enough cash to self-fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of 12.0 percent.
785786_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually.
785786_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our WACC was 11.0 percent , 11.0 percent , and 12.0 percent for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
785786_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders.
785786_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	ROIC was 14.0 percent , 15.2 percent , and 14.0 percent for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
785786_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Fiscal 2015 ROIC of 14.0 percent reflects an Economic Return of 3.0 percent, based on our weighted average cost of capital of 11.0 percent.
785786_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	While invested capital grew at a similar pace to revenue, fiscal 2015 operating profit, before restructuring, grew 5.0 percent due to lower margin performance.
785786_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	See the table below for our calculation of ROIC (dollars in millions):
785786_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	We define ROIC as tax-effected operating income before restructuring and impairment charges divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period for the fiscal year.
785786_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents.
785786_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way.
785786_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	ROIC and other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
785786_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance.
785786_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	In particular, we provide ROIC because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view ROIC as an important measure in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital requirements.
785786_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	We also use a derivative measure of ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation.
785786_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	For a reconciliation of ROIC to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
785786_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	RECENT DEVELOPMENT On November 4, 2015, the Company announced plans to close its manufacturing facility in Fremont, California as a result of the Company s optimization of its capacity to align with customer demand due to changing end-market dynamics.
785786_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Plexus expects to incur approximately $3.0 to $5.0 million of restructuring charges as a result of this action by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016.
785786_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	REPORTABLE SEGMENTS A further discussion of our fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 financial performance by reportable segment is presented below (in millions):
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the AMER segment increased $150.8 million , or 12.2 percent , as compared to fiscal 2014 , primarily due to a new industrial/commercial sector customer that ramped during fiscal 2015, which contributed $45.6 million in sales, and a $37.2 million increase in net sales from a customer in the networking/communications sector as a result of new product ramps and expansion of its end-market demand.
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The remainder of the increase was a result of increased end-market demand and new product ramps for several of our larger customers across the industrial/commercial and healthcare/life sciences sectors.
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	These increases were partially offset by the disengagement of a customer due to the inability to reach contractual terms, which resulted in a $22.1 million decrease.
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S3	There was also a $19.8 million decrease due to a customer that experienced softening in its end-market demand, a $14.6 million decrease due to the loss of a customer program, and softening end-market demand for several customers, particularly in the networking/communications sector.
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S4	During fiscal 2015 , production of a healthcare/life sciences customer was transfered from the AMER segment to the APAC segment, which resulted in a decrease of $8.4 million (sales to this customer increased by $47.0 million in the APAC segment, as noted below).
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S5	Operating income for fiscal 2015 decreased $10.6 million from fiscal 2014 primarily due to continued investments in our new manufacturing facilities in Neenah and Guadalajara, and costs related to production process constraints in a focus factory for our defense/security/aerospace sector, partially offset by the increase in net sales.
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S6	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the AMER segment increased $175.4 million, or 16.5 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to increased net sales of $154.8 million to a key networking/communications customer resulting from a new product ramp.
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S7	Increased end-market demand and new product ramps on several of our larger customers across all four sectors drove further increased sales for fiscal 2014.
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S8	Partially offsetting these increases was a $115.8 million decrease in net sales from the disengagement of Juniper.
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S9	Operating income for fiscal 2014 increased $8.3 million from fiscal 2013 primarily due to the increase in net sales.
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S10	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the APAC segment increased $153.4 million , or 13.5 percent , as compared to fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P30_S11	Net sales increased in all market sectors with the most significant increase in the networking/communications sector, including a combined $62.8 million increase for three customers as a result of increased end-market demand and an aggregate $23.9 million increase related to program ramps for two customers.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	healthcare/life sciences sector increased by $47.0 million.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	Operating income increased $24.7 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 , primarily as a result of the increase in net sales as fixed manufacturing expense and S A for the segment were relatively stable in fiscal 2015 as compared to 2014.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the APAC segment decreased $13.8 million, or 1.2 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to a $166.8 million decrease in net sales resulting from the disengagement of Juniper.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in net sales of $82.9 million to one of our larger networking/communications customers as a result of new product ramps and an increase in net sales of $61.8 million to two of our larger healthcare/life sciences customers.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S4	Operating income increased $19.2 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of favorable changes in customer mix and supply chain productivity.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S5	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the EMEA segment increased $24.4 million , or 21.1 percent , as compared to fiscal 2014 , primarily due to a combined increase of $18.7 million from three new customers, a $7.3 million increase to a networking/communications customer due to improved end-market demand and new product ramps, and increased end-market demand for several other customers.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S6	This was partially offset by a $7.2 million decrease as a result of end of life products along with the effects of decreased end-market demand for several other customers.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S7	Operating loss decreased $3.8 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in net sales and improved profitability for engineering related services.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S8	Net sales for fiscal 2014 in the EMEA segment decreased $6.6 million, or 5.4 percent, as compared to fiscal 2013, due primarily to the disengagement of two customers.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S9	Operating loss increased $8.8 million in the current year as compared to the prior year due to increased fixed manufacturing expenses in both Oradea and the U.K., resulting from increased depreciation and personnel expenses associated with facility investments.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S10	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents were $357.1 million as of October 3, 2015 as compared to $346.6 million as of September 27, 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S11	Cash generated from operations and stock option exercises in fiscal 2015 were substantially offset by cash used for capital expenditures, primarily related to facility investments, purchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program, and capital lease payments.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S12	As of October 3, 2015 , 86.2 percent of our cash and cash equivalents balances were held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S13	Certain foreign countries impose taxes and overall penalties on transfers of cash; however, our intent is to permanently reinvest funds held in these countries.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S14	If this cash were remitted to the U.S., additional tax obligations may result that would reduce the amount of cash ultimately available to us in the U.S.
785786_15_ITEM7_P31_S15	Currently, we believe that cash held in the U.S., together with cash available under U.S. credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities, will be sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.
785786_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The following table provides a summary of cash flows for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , excluding the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (in millions):
785786_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $76.6 million for fiscal 2015 , as compared to $88.4 million for fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The decrease was primarily attributable to a significant increase in accounts payable for fiscal 2014 (discussed in the paragraph below) and an increase in net sales to customers with longer payment terms, which resulted in higher accounts receivable balances at the end of fiscal 2015.
785786_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	This was partially offset by improvement in cash flows used for inventory as fiscal 2014 had a significant inventory increase due to the timing of inventory build to support forecasted sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, coupled with an increase in customer deposits and improved earnings.
785786_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $88.4 million for fiscal 2014 , as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $207.6 million for fiscal 2013 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P33_S4	The decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales, which resulted in higher inventory and accounts receivable balances at the end of fiscal 2014.
785786_15_ITEM7_P33_S5	Additionally, increases in forecasted net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2014 also resulted in higher inventory and accounts payable balances at the end of fiscal 2014.
785786_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table provides a summary of cash cycle days for the periods indicated (in days):
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	We calculate days in accounts receivable as accounts receivable for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	We calculate days in inventory, accounts payable, and cash deposits as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	We calculate annualized cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits.
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	Days in accounts receivable for the three months ended October 3, 2015 increased nine days compared to the three months ended September 27, 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S4	The increase is primarily attributable to increased net sales to customers with longer payment terms.
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S5	Days in inventory for the three months ended October 3, 2015 increased five days compared to the three months ended September 27, 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S6	The increase is primarily due to inventory procurements to fulfill anticipated fiscal 2016 customer demand, which was initially higher than the comparable fiscal 2015 demand at the end of fiscal 2014.
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S7	This forecast was subsequently reduced, due to the end market softening.
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S8	Days in accounts payable for the three months ended October 3, 2015 was consistent compared to the three months ended September 27, 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S9	Days in cash deposits for the three months ended October 3, 2015 increased four days compared to the three months ended September 27, 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S10	The increase was primarily attributable to three significant customer deposits received in fiscal 2015.
785786_15_ITEM7_P35_S11	As of October 3, 2015 annualized cash cycle days increased ten days compared to September 27, 2014 due to the factors discussed above.
785786_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	We define FCF as cash flow provided by (or used in) operations less capital expenditures, was $41.5 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $23.1 million for fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase of $18.4 million was primarily attributable to the reduction in capital expenditures described below, partially offset by a reduction in cash provided by operating activities, as discussed above.
785786_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures, including FCF, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance.
785786_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	In particular, we provide FCF because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions.
785786_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	We view FCF as an important financial metric as it demonstrates our ability to generate cash and allows us to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.
785786_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure which should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
785786_15_ITEM7_P37_S4	The following table provides a reconciliation of FCF to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP (in millions):
785786_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Cash flows used in investing activities were $34.7 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $62.6 million for fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	The reduction was due to a $30.2 million decrease in capital expenditures primarily related to our facility investment for Guadalajara during fiscal 2014.
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal 2014 decreased to $62.6 million from $107.2 million in fiscal 2013 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	The reduction was due to a $42.8 million decrease in capital expenditures.
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	This decrease was primarily attributable to a facility investment at one location (Guadalajara) during fiscal 2014, relative to facility investments at three locations during fiscal 2013 (Xiamen, China; Oradea, Romania; and Neenah, Wisconsin).
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	We utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal 2015 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	We currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 will be approximately $35 million to $40 million.
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S5	Cash flows used in financing activities were $26.2 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $21.0 million for fiscal 2014 .
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S6	The increase was primarily attributable to reduced proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2015.
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S7	Cash flows used in financing activities were $21.0 million for fiscal 2014 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $57.4 million for fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S8	The decrease was primarily attributable to lower common stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2014 relative to fiscal 2013, as well as term loan repayments in fiscal 2013.
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S9	The decrease was further enhanced by the effect of higher stock option exercise activity in fiscal 2014 relative to fiscal 2013 due to more favorable market conditions during fiscal 2014.
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S10	On August 20, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock during fiscal 2016.
785786_15_ITEM7_P39_S11	The Company expects to complete this program on a relatively consistent basis during fiscal 2016.
785786_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	On August 13, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock during fiscal 2015.
785786_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	During fiscal 2015, the Company repurchased 745,227 shares under this program for $30.0 million , at an average price of $40.26 per share.
785786_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	On August 19, 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock during fiscal 2014.
785786_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	During fiscal 2014, the Company repurchased 733,447 shares under this program for $30.0 million , at an average price of $40.90 per share.
785786_15_ITEM7_P40_S5	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company has a $235.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a termination date of May 15, 2019 (the "Credit Facility").
785786_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	In October 2015, subsequent to fiscal 2015 year end, $30.0 million of an accordion feature thereunder was exercised, increasing the maximum commitment under the Credit Facility to $265.0 million .
785786_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	The Credit Facility may potentially be increased by an additional $70.0 million to $335.0 million , generally by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders subject to certain customary conditions.
785786_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	During fiscal 2015, the highest daily borrowing was $207.0 million , the average daily borrowings were $147.8 million , and the Company borrowed and repaid $483.0 million of revolving borrowings under the Credit Facility.
785786_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Facility, at the Company's option, bear interest at a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the Company's leverage ratio as defined in the related credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement").
785786_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	Rates would increase upon negative changes in specified Company financial metrics and would decrease to no less than LIBOR plus 1.0% or base rate plus 0.0% upon reduction in the current total leverage ratio.
785786_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	As of October 3, 2015, the borrowing rate under the Credit Agreement was LIBOR plus 1.125% (or 1.329%).
785786_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	As of October 3, 2015, the $75.0 million of outstanding debt under the Credit Facility is effectively at a fixed interest rate as a result of a $75.0 million notional amount of interest rate swap contracts discussed in Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	The Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused revolver credit commitment based on the Company's leverage ratio; the fee was 0.175% as of October 3, 2015.
785786_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	The financial covenants (as defined under the Credit Agreement) require, among other covenants, that the Company maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
785786_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	As of October 3, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit Agreement.
785786_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	In fiscal 2011, Plexus entered into a note purchase agreement (the "Note Purchase Agreement") related to the $175.0 million in principal amount of the Company's 5.20% Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2018 (the "Notes").
785786_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The Note Purchase Agreement contains certain financial covenants, which include a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth test, all as defined in the agreements.
785786_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	As of October 3, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants relating to the Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement.
785786_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the repurchase of shares provided that no event of default (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases.
785786_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	currently anticipate paying them in the future.
785786_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	However, we evaluate from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases above those already authorized, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, potential borrowings under the Credit Facility, and our leasing capabilities, should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months.
785786_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing.
785786_15_ITEM7_P47_S4	Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources.
785786_15_ITEM7_P47_S5	However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms.
785786_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings.
785786_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	Information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 3, 2015 (dollars in millions):
785786_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	1) Includes amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.
785786_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	As of October 3, 2015 , the outstanding balance was $75.0 million .
785786_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	The amounts listed above include interest; see Note 4 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	2) Includes $175.0 million in principal amount of Notes.
785786_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	The amounts listed above include interest; see Note 4 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	3) As of October 3, 2015 , purchase obligations consist of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business.
785786_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	4) As of October 3, 2015 , other long-term obligations on the balance sheet included deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers, as well as other key employees, and an asset retirement obligation.
785786_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	We have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately $2.4 million , as of October 3, 2015 , related to unrecognized income tax benefits.
785786_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Company cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to these obligations.
785786_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	5) As of October 3, 2015 , other long-term obligations not on the balance sheet consisted of guarantees and a commitment for salary continuation and certain benefits in the event employment of one executive officer of the Company is terminated without cause.
785786_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	Excluded from the amounts disclosed are certain bonus and incentive compensation amounts, which would be paid on a prorated basis in the year of termination.
785786_15_ITEM7_P52_S4	6) Includes future minimum payments under the base lease agreement in Guadalajara, Mexico.
785786_15_ITEM7_P52_S5	Excludes $20.3 million of future minimum payments under renewal options from 2025 through 2034.
785786_15_ITEM7_P52_S6	See Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	During fiscal 2015 , there were no material changes to these policies.
785786_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	Our more critical accounting estimates are described below: Revenue Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled.
785786_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling, if applicable.
785786_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with durations of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740.
785786_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
785786_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_15_ITEM7_P58_S3	The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
785786_15_ITEM7_P58_S4	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_15_ITEM7_P58_S5	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
785786_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	We used the modified prospective application, under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income beginning with the first period that we adopted the FASB regulation and continuing to be expensed thereafter.
785786_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value stock options and the Monte Carlo valuation model to value performance stock units.
785786_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	See Note 9, "Benefit Plans," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Foreign Currency Risk We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
785786_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Based on the Company s overall currency exposure, as of October 3, 2015 , a 10.0 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We have financial instruments, including cash equivalents, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions and have entered into interest rate swaps related to borrowings under our Credit Facility.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	For more information, refer to Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Interest rate swap agreements are subject to the further risk that the counterparties to these agreements may fail to comply with their obligations thereunder.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	To achieve this, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of highly rated securities, money market funds and certificates of deposit, and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P7_S2	As of October 3, 2015 , our only material interest rate risk is associated with our Credit Facility, which had an outstanding balance of $75 million.
785786_15_ITEM7A_P7_S3	As of the end of fiscal 2015, through the use of interest rate swaps, as described above, we fixed the basis on which we pay interest with a $75 million notional amount of interest rate swap contracts, and the borrowings under the Notes are based on a fixed interest rate, thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk.

785786_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Plexus Corp.:
785786_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries at October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 3, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
785786_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
785786_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 3, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
785786_15_ITEM8_P2_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
785786_15_ITEM8_P2_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
785786_15_ITEM8_P2_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
785786_15_ITEM8_P2_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
785786_15_ITEM8_P2_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
785786_15_ITEM8_P2_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
785786_15_ITEM8_P2_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
785786_15_ITEM8_P2_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
785786_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
785786_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
785786_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
785786_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

785786_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
785786_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business: Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together Plexus or the Company, ) participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ( EMS ) industry.
785786_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	Plexus provides integrated product conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and sustaining solutions to customers in the Networking/Communications, Healthcare/Life Sciences, Industrial/Commercial and Defense/Security/Aerospace market sectors.
785786_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	Plexus is headquartered in Neenah, Wisconsin and has operations in the Americas ( AMER ), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA ) and Asia-Pacific ( APAC ) regions.
785786_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation Principles and Basis of Presentation:
785786_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include the accounts of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries.
785786_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
785786_15_ITEM8_P11_S2	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
785786_15_ITEM8_P11_S3	The Company s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
785786_15_ITEM8_P11_S4	The Company also uses a 4-4-5 weekly accounting system for the interim periods in each quarter.
785786_15_ITEM8_P11_S5	Each quarter, therefore, ends on a Saturday at the end of the 4-4-5 period.
785786_15_ITEM8_P11_S6	Periodically, an additional week must be added to the fiscal year to re-align with the Saturday closest to September 30.
785786_15_ITEM8_P11_S7	Fiscal 2015 included 53 weeks, and fiscal 2014 and 2013 each included 52 weeks; the first quarter of fiscal 2015 included 14 weeks and all other fiscal quarters presented included 13 weeks.
785786_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company s reportable segments consist of AMER, APAC and EMEA.
785786_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	Refer to Note 11, "Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers," for further details on reportable segments.
785786_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents include short-term highly liquid investments and are classified as Level 1 in the fair level hierarchy described below.
785786_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	As of October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 , cash and cash equivalents were the following (in thousands):
785786_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
785786_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
785786_15_ITEM8_P14_S2	Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment.
785786_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond the Company s control.
785786_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory.
785786_15_ITEM8_P15_S2	Any actions taken by the Company s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.
785786_15_ITEM8_P15_S3	In certain instances, in accordance with contractual terms, the Company receives customer deposits to offset obsolete and excess inventory risks.
785786_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
785786_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	Estimated useful lives for major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
785786_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Certain facilities and equipment held under capital leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities.
785786_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	Amortization of assets held under capital leases is included in depreciation expense (see Note 3, "Property, Plant and Equipment") and the financing component of the lease payments is classified as interest expense.
785786_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
785786_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company capitalizes significant costs incurred in the acquisition or development of software for internal use.
785786_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	This includes costs of the software, consulting services and compensation costs for employees directly involved in developing internal use computer software.
785786_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups may not be recoverable through estimated future undiscounted cash flows.
785786_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a charge against current operations.
785786_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_15_ITEM8_P19_S3	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.
785786_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.
785786_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured products based on management s analysis of historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling.
785786_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as program costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_15_ITEM8_P24_S3	Net sales from engineering design and development services were less than 5.0 percent of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
785786_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740").
785786_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
785786_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_15_ITEM8_P26_S2	The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes that would become payable upon the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
785786_15_ITEM8_P26_S3	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_15_ITEM8_P26_S4	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.
785786_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Foreign Currency Translation: The Company translates assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the relevant balance sheet date and net sales, expenses and cash flows at the average exchange rates during the respective periods.
785786_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	Adjustments resulting from translation of the financial statements are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
785786_15_ITEM8_P27_S2	Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved and remeasurement adjustments for foreign operations where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency are included in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as a component of miscellaneous income (expense).
785786_15_ITEM8_P27_S3	Exchange gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions were $1.3 million , $(0.1) million , and $(1.2) million for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
785786_15_ITEM8_P27_S4	These amounts include the amount of gain (loss) recognized in income during each fiscal year due to non-designated forward currency exchange contracts the Company entered into during each respective year.
785786_15_ITEM8_P27_S5	Refer to Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," for further details on derivatives.
785786_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Derivatives: All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.
785786_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company periodically enters into forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
785786_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability (a non-designated hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge), or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.
785786_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
785786_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a non-designated hedge are recorded in earnings as are the gains or losses related to the hedged asset or liability.
785786_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within shareholders equity, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
785786_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	Changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within shareholders equity.
785786_15_ITEM8_P32_S2	The Company's interest rate swaps and certain forward currency exchange contracts are treated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, $(11.2) million , $1.6 million and $(2.7) million were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
785786_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Grants from Government Authorities: Grants from governments are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant funds will be received and the Company will comply with all attached conditions to the grant.
785786_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are recorded as an offset to the carrying value of the related assets at the time of capitalization.
785786_15_ITEM8_P33_S2	Government grants relating to other costs incurred are recognized as an offset to those related costs, for which the grants are intended to compensate for, at the time they are recognized.
785786_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Earnings Per Share: The computation of basic earnings per common share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and net income.
785786_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	The computation of diluted earnings per common share reflects additional dilution from share-based awards, excluding any with an antidilutive effect.
785786_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Stock-based Compensation: The Company measures all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, at fair value and expenses them in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	Comprehensive (Loss) Income: The Company follows the established standards for reporting comprehensive (loss) income, which is defined as the changes in equity of an enterprise except those resulting from shareholder transactions.
785786_15_ITEM8_P35_S2	Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income consists of the following as of October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 (in thousands):
785786_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Refer to Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," for further explanation regarding the change in fair value of derivative instruments, net of tax adjustments, that is recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
785786_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
785786_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
785786_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The Company holds financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, certain deferred compensation assets held under trust arrangements, accounts payable, debt, and derivatives.
785786_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and capital lease obligations as reported in the consolidated financial statements approximate fair value.
785786_15_ITEM8_P38_S2	Derivatives and certain deferred compensation assets held under a trust and a rabbi trust arrangement are recorded at fair value.
785786_15_ITEM8_P38_S3	Accounts receivable are reflected at net realizable value based on anticipated losses due to potentially uncollectible balances.
785786_15_ITEM8_P38_S4	Anticipated losses are based on management s analysis of historical losses and changes in customers credit status.
785786_15_ITEM8_P38_S5	The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was $250.2 million and $247.5 million as of October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 , respectively.
785786_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company uses quoted market prices when available or discounted cash flows to calculate fair value.
785786_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described below.
785786_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
785786_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
785786_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.
785786_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	The input levels are: Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
785786_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
785786_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.
785786_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Business and Credit Concentrations: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and derivative instruments, specifically related to counterparties.
785786_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	In accordance with the Company s investment policy, the Company s cash, cash equivalents and derivative instruments were placed with recognized financial institutions.
785786_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company s investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure in any one issue and the maturity date of the investment securities that typically comprise investment grade short-term debt instruments.
785786_15_ITEM8_P44_S3	The Company, at times, requires cash deposits for services performed.
785786_15_ITEM8_P44_S4	The Company also closely monitors extensions of credit.
785786_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of inventory measured using first-in, first-out or average cost.
785786_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	The new standard replaces the current lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test.
785786_15_ITEM8_P45_S2	Under the guidance issued, market could be replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin.
785786_15_ITEM8_P45_S3	Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
785786_15_ITEM8_P45_S4	This guidance should be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
785786_15_ITEM8_P45_S5	The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact the new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an amendment that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
785786_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	Under the new guidance, the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs is not affected.
785786_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015.
785786_15_ITEM8_P46_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance for revenue recognition.
785786_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
785786_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance.
785786_15_ITEM8_P48_S2	This may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
785786_15_ITEM8_P48_S3	In July 2015 the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the standard.
785786_15_ITEM8_P48_S4	The new standard will become effective retrospectively for the Company for the fiscal first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted, but not before the original effective date (fiscal first quarter of 2018).
785786_15_ITEM8_P48_S5	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_15_ITEM8_P48_S6	In April 2014, the FASB issued final guidance that changes the criteria for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation.
785786_15_ITEM8_P48_S7	The revised guidance defines a discontinued operation as (1) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of by sale, disposed of other than by sale or is classified as held for sale that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results or (2) an acquired business or nonprofit activity that is classified as held for sale on the date of acquisition.
785786_15_ITEM8_P48_S8	The guidance does not change the presentation requirements for discontinued operations in the statement where net income is presented but does require the reclassification of assets and liabilities of a discontinued operation in the statement of financial position for all prior periods presented.
785786_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	The guidance is effective prospectively for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years, and for all businesses that, on acquisition, are classified as held for sale that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years.
785786_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in previously issued financial statements.
785786_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Inventories Inventories as of October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 consisted of the following (in thousands):
785786_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	In certain circumstances, per contractual terms, customer deposits are received by the Company to offset obsolete and excess inventory risks.
785786_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	The total amount of customer deposits related to inventory and included within current liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 was $64.3 million and $51.0 million , respectively.
785786_15_ITEM8_P51_S2	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment as of October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 consisted of the following (in thousands):
785786_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	Assets held under capital leases and included in property, plant and equipment as of October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 consisted of the following (in thousands):
785786_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	The building and improvements category in the above table includes a leased manufacturing facility in San Diego, California, which is no longer used by the Company and has been subleased.

785786_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
785786_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
785786_15_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
785786_15_ITEM9A_P3_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.
785786_15_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
785786_15_ITEM9A_P3_S5	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
785786_15_ITEM9A_P3_S6	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
785786_15_ITEM9A_P3_S7	Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have nonetheless reached the conclusion that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

785786_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, flexibility and fulfillment requirements, and complex regulatory requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs.

785786_16_ITEM1_P12_S6	In addition to manufacturing, turnkey service requires material procurement and warehousing and involves greater resource investments than consignment services.
785786_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Other than certain test equipment, manufacturing equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.

785786_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	Our disciplined approach and team structure enables significant project schedule flexibility via work-sharing across our organization.
785786_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Product design includes, but is not limited to, the following solutions:
785786_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	The commercialize phase carries significant influence with respect to converting ideas into viable products.
785786_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	Commercialization starts early in the design phase and extends through manufacturing transition, often in tandem with Design for Excellence ( DFX ).
785786_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	Our DFX solutions encompass a wide collection of specific design solutions including design for test, design for manufacturability/assembly and design for fabrication.
785786_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	The goal of DFX is to facilitate an efficient transition from engineering to manufacturing.
785786_16_ITEM1_P21_S4	Commercialization also includes prototyping, new product introduction, design for supply chain, test development and transition management.
785786_16_ITEM1_P21_S5	We believe our commercialization solutions provide significant value by accelerating speed-to-market, reducing change activity and providing customers with a robust and manufacturable product.
785786_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Plexus applies an optimized manufacturing approach, not a one-size-fits-all model.
785786_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our scalable manufacturing solutions create flexibility for our customers through tailored supply chain solutions.
785786_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	Our focus-factory model provides a dedicated team designed to drive success that places the customer at the center of operations.
785786_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Plexus focuses exclusively on mid-to-low volume, higher-complexity programs that range from lower-level assemblies to finished electro-mechanical products.
785786_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our manufactured products typically fall into one of the following categories in our assembly spectrum:
785786_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	System and mechatronic integration products may run larger in size than other assemblies; the products range from kiosks to finished healthcare devices and life sciences equipment to other complex electro-mechanical assemblies.
785786_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	These products often combine other integrated solutions we provide and may require unique facility configurations or supply chain solutions.
785786_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Plexus offers fulfillment and logistics solutions to our customers in the forms of Direct Order Fulfillment ( DOF ), Build to Order ( BTO ) and Configure to Order ( CTO ).
785786_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	Plexus receives DOF orders from our customers that provide the final specifications and configurations required by their end customers.
785786_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	Through BTO and CTO, Plexus delivers the product directly to the end customer.
785786_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	The DOF process relies on Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) systems integrating the overall supply chain, from parts procurement through manufacturing and logistics.
785786_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	Plexus sustains our customers' products by providing a range of Aftermarket Services, including complex repair, refurbishment and product support for products the Company manufactures.
785786_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	In addition, we also provide customized solutions for products we did not manufacture.
785786_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	All Plexus manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to a baseline Quality Management System standard per ISO9001:2008, and currently are transitioning to the ISO9001:2015 version.
785786_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	We have capabilities to assemble finished medical devices meeting FDA Quality Systems Regulation requirements and similar regulatory requirements in other countries.
785786_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	We have additional certifications and/or registrations held by certain facilities in the following regions:
785786_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Customers and Market Sectors Served Our customers range from large multinational companies to smaller emerging technology companies.
785786_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	During fiscal 2016, we served approximately 140 customers.
785786_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	We offer advanced design and production capabilities, allowing our customers to concentrate on their core competencies.
785786_16_ITEM1_P30_S3	Plexus helps accelerate our customers' time to market, reduce their investment in engineering and manufacturing capacity, and optimize total product cost.
785786_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	General Electric Company ( GE ), Micron Technology, Inc. ( Micron ) and ARRIS Group, Inc. ( Arris ) accounted for 11.1% , 10.4% , and 10.1% respectively, of our net sales during fiscal 2016 .
785786_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	Arris and GE accounted for 12.6% and 10.6% , respectively, of our net sales in fiscal 2015 , and 12.5% and 11.2% , respectively, of our net sales in fiscal 2014 .
785786_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	Other than Arris and GE, and Micron in fiscal 2016, no other customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our net sales in the last three fiscal years.
785786_16_ITEM1_P31_S3	Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays, modifications and transitions.
785786_16_ITEM1_P31_S4	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers.
785786_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Customers' forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions.
785786_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations.
785786_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	The loss of any major customer could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.
785786_16_ITEM1_P32_S3	In addition, as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector.
785786_16_ITEM1_P32_S4	Many of our large customers contract with us through multiple independent divisions, subsidiaries, production facilities or locations.
785786_16_ITEM1_P32_S5	We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others.
785786_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for the indicated fiscal years is shown in the following table:
785786_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Plexus offers a uniform array of services for customers in each market sector and we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources to particular market sectors, nor internally track our costs and resources per market sector.
785786_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Materials and Suppliers We typically purchase raw materials, including PCBs and electronic components, from manufacturers and distributors.
785786_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	Under certain circumstances, we will purchase components from brokers, customers or competitors.
785786_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	The key electronic components we purchase include: specialized components (such as application-specific integrated circuits), semiconductors, interconnect products, electronic subassemblies (including memory modules, power supply modules and cable and wire harnesses), inductors, resistors and capacitors.
785786_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	We also purchase non-electronic, typically custom engineered, components used in manufacturing and higher-level assembly.
785786_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	These components include molded/formed plastics, sheet metal fabrications, aluminum extrusions, robotics, motors, vision sensors, motion/actuation, fluidics, displays, die castings and various other hardware and fastener components.
785786_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	These components are sourced from both Plexus preferred suppliers and customer directed suppliers.
785786_16_ITEM1_P36_S3	Components range from standard to highly customized and vary widely in terms of market availability and price.
785786_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	Component shortages and subsequent allocations by our suppliers are an inherent risk to the electronics industry, and have particularly been an issue for us and the industry from time to time.
785786_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	We discuss the causes of these shortages more fully in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A herein.
785786_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	We actively manage our business to minimize our exposure to material and component shortages.
785786_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Plexus global supply chain management organization attempts to create strong supplier alliances and ensure a steady flow of components and products at competitive prices.
785786_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	We strive to achieve these goals through advanced supply chain solutions we develop in partnership with our customers, risk management tools and global expediting processes.
785786_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Plexus can often influence the selection of new product components throughout the design phase of the Product Realization Value Stream.
785786_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Competition Plexus operates in a highly competitive market, with a goal to be best-in-class at meeting the unique needs of our customers.
785786_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	We provide flexible solutions, timely order fulfillment, and strong engineering, testing and production capabilities.
785786_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	A number of competitors may provide electronics manufacturing and engineering services similar to Plexus.
785786_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	Others may be more established in certain industry sectors, or have greater financial, manufacturing or marketing resources.
785786_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	Smaller competitors compete mainly in specific sectors and within limited geographic areas.
785786_16_ITEM1_P42_S3	Plexus occasionally competes with in-house capabilities of current and potential customers.
785786_16_ITEM1_P42_S4	Plexus maintains awareness and knowledge of our competitors' capabilities, in order to remain highly competitive within the broad scope of the EMS industry.
785786_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	We own various service marks that we use in our business, which are registered in the trademark offices of the United States and other countries.
785786_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	Although we own certain patents, they are not currently material to our business.
785786_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	We do not have any material copyrights.
785786_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our integrated ERP, warehouse management and shop floor control systems serve all of our manufacturing sites, providing a core set of consistent, global business applications.
785786_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	This consistency augments our other management information systems, allowing us to standardize our ability to translate data from multiple production facilities into operational and financial information.
785786_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	The related software licenses are of a general commercial character on terms customary for these types of agreements.
785786_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Environmental Compliance We are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to air emission standards and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process.
785786_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state and foreign environmental laws and do not anticipate any significant expenditures in maintaining our compliance; however, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
785786_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Social Responsibility Plexus is committed to social responsibility throughout our global business operations.
785786_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our commitment to social responsibility extends to human rights, labor practices, the environment, worker health and safety, fair operating practices and the Company s social impact in the communities where we operate.
785786_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	We consider a variety of standards for socially responsible practices, including local and federal legal requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate, the International Organization for Standardization s Guidance on Social Responsibility (ISO 26000) and standards established by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (the "EICC").
785786_16_ITEM1_P47_S3	Plexus is a member of the EICC.
785786_16_ITEM1_P47_S4	Information about our corporate social responsibility efforts is available on our website at www.plexus.com/about-us/social-responsibility.
785786_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Employees We make a considerable effort to maintain a highly-qualified and engaged work force.
785786_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	We have been able to offer enhanced career opportunities to many of our employees.
785786_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our human resources department identifies career objectives and monitors specific skill development opportunities for employees with potential for advancement.
785786_16_ITEM1_P48_S3	We invest at all levels of the organization to ensure that employees are well trained and qualified for their positions.
785786_16_ITEM1_P48_S4	We have a policy of involvement and consultation with employees at every facility and strive for continuous improvement at all levels.
785786_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	We employ approximately 14,000 full-time employees.
785786_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	Given the quick response times required by our customers, we seek to maintain flexibility to scale our operations as necessary to maximize efficiency.
785786_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	To do so we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees.
785786_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	Approximately 230 and 650 of our employees are covered by union agreements in the United Kingdom and Mexico, respectively.
785786_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year, although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years.
785786_16_ITEM1_P49_S5	Our employees in China, Germany, Malaysia, Romania and the United States are not covered by union agreements.
785786_16_ITEM1_P49_S6	We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities, and we believe that our employee relationships are generally positive and stable.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions and world events.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose any of these customers or if there are challenges in those market sectors, our net sales and operating results could decline significantly.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ten largest customers accounted for 58.8% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2016 , and 56.1% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	During the fiscal years ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 , there were three and two customers, respectively, that each represented 10.0% or more of our net sales.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our major customers may vary from period to period, and our major customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all, particularly given the volatile nature of certain programs.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We have experienced from time to time, and in the future may experience, significant customer or program disengagements and the end of life of significant programs.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Especially given our discrete number of customers, significant reductions in net sales to any of our major customers, the loss of major customers or our failure to make appropriate choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business and results of operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S7	In addition, we focus our sales efforts on customers in only a few market sectors.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Economic, business or regulatory conditions that affect the sector, or the Company s failure to choose appropriate sectors, can particularly impact Plexus.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S10	For instance, sales in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector are substantially affected by trends in the healthcare industry, such as government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the financial health of, and pending changes in the structure of, the U.S. health care sector generally, including as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Affordable Care Act").
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Further, potential reductions in U.S. government agency spending, including those due to budget cuts or other political developments or issues, could affect opportunities in all of our market sectors.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Any weakness in our customers' end markets could affect our business and results of operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S13	We rely on timely and regular payments from our customers; therefore, deterioration in the payment experience with or credit quality of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P2_S14	The inability or failure of our major customers to meet their obligations to us or their bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	From time to time, our customers, including formerly major customers, have been affected by merger and acquisition activity.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	While these transactions may present Plexus with opportunities to capture new business, they also create the risk that these customers will partially reduce their purchases or completely disengage from us as a result of transitioning such business to Plexus' competitors or deciding to manufacture the products internally.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Plexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and currency risks.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We have operations in many countries; operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate represent a majority of our net sales and operating income, with a particular concentration in Malaysia.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, a significant amount of our cash balances are currently held outside of the U.S., with a particular concentration in Malaysia.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	These international aspects of our operations, which are likely to increase over time, subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results:
785786_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	potential disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access cash amounts held outside of the U.S.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	regulatory requirements and potential changes to those requirements.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We continue to monitor our risk associated with foreign currency and have entered into limited forward contracts to address this risk.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As our international operations expand, our failure to appropriately address foreign currency transactions or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, developments affecting particular countries can adversely affect our ability to access cash or other assets held in such countries.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A significant portion of our operations currently occurs in, and cash balances are held in, the APAC region, particularly in Malaysia.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The concentration of our operations, assets and profitability in that region exposes us to adverse developments, economic, political or otherwise, in those countries.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties, tariffs or taxes, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	For example, our facility in Mexico operates under the Mexican Maquiladora ("IMMEX") program.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our customers do not make long-term commitments and may cancel or change their production requirements.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Companies in our industry must respond quickly to the requirements of their customers in both design and production.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Customers also cancel requirements, change engineering or other service requirements, change production quantities, delay production or revise their forecasts for a number of reasons that are beyond our control.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	The success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our working capital levels.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred from time to time and may continue to occur in the future.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers requirements, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital management, facility and capacity requirements, personnel needs and other resource requirements.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The short-term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate their future requirements.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Because certain of our operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our operating results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Moreover, because our margins vary across customers and specific programs, a reduction in demand with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Rapid increases in customer requirements may stress personnel and other capacity resources.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We may not have sufficient resources at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program, which could result in a loss of business from such customers.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We have a complex business model, and our failure to properly manage or execute on that model, as well as an inability to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise, could adversely affect our operations, financial results and reputation.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our business model focuses on products and services in the mid-to-lower-volume, higher-complexity segment of our industry.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our customers products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility, in some cases necessitating optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solutions across an integrated global platform.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The products we manufacture are also typically complex, heavily regulated, and require complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, we offer Aftermarket Services to our customers, which add to the complexity of our business model.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Our business model requires a great degree of attention, flexibility and resources.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	These resources include working capital, management and technical personnel, and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse manufacturing, regulatory and service requirements for multiple programs of varying sizes simultaneously, including in multiple locations and geographies.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We also depend on securing and ramping new customers and programs and on transitioning production for new customers and programs, which creates added complexities related to managing the start-up risks of such projects, especially for companies that did not previously outsource such activities.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The complexity of our service model, which encompasses a broad range of services including conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and Aftermarket Services, often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations as well as commitments from us to our customers.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If we fail to meet those obligations, it could result in claims against us or adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If we fail to effectively manage or execute our business model, we may lose customer confidence and our reputation may suffer.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The Company s reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to maintain or expand business opportunities could be impaired and our financial results could suffer on a going-forward basis.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Many of the markets for our manufacturing, engineering, aftermarket and other services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process developments.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our internal processes are also subject to these factors.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The continued success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to:
785786_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will maintain or develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The emergence of new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, we may have to acquire new design, assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment, and the offering of new or additional services to our customers, may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	to maintain our personnel and other resources during times of fluctuating demand, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our products and services are for end markets that require technologically advanced products.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Factors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve could adversely affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	the potential failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Even if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business relationships with them and our production for, or services offered to, them, can affect our production cycles, inventory management and results of operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs, or the provision of new services, could affect our operations and financial results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new programs or types of services (including expansion of our Aftermarket Services capabilities) for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to opportunities.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We must initially determine whether it would be in our interests from a business perspective to pursue a particular potential new customer, program or service, including evaluating the customer s, program s or service s fit with our value proposition as well as its potential end-market success.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If we make the decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the anticipated costs, risks and rewards.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The failure to make prudent engagement decisions or to establish appropriate terms of engagement could adversely affect our profitability and margins.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	service s anticipated revenue; these factors can sometimes extend for a significant period.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Some new programs or services require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and competencies.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We may not meet customer expectations, which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver conforming product or services on a timely basis.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market acceptance, regulatory approvals or economic conditions.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute on a new program s or service s requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In recent years, our revenue growth has been more heavily dependent on ramping new program wins as compared to end-market growth of mature programs.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The management of resources in connection with the establishment of new or recent programs and customer relationships, as well as program transfers between facilities and geographies, and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross and operating margins and level of working capital.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life-cycle of new programs, which typically lack a track record of order volume and timing as well as production efficiencies in the early stages.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We typically manage multiple new programs at any given time; therefore, we are exposed to these factors in varying magnitudes.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, if any of these programs or customer relationships were terminated, our operating results could be negatively impacted, particularly in the short-term.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations and geographies.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We conduct these transfers on a regular basis to meet customer needs, seek long-term efficiencies or respond to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Although we try to minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between our facilities and geographies, there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P22_S7	While these factors tend to affect new, recent or transferred programs, they can also impact more mature, or maturing programs and customer relationships, especially programs where end-market demand can be somewhat volatile.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Changes in tax laws, potential tax disputes, negative or unforeseen tax consequences or further developments affecting our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company s effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic mix of earnings across the jurisdictions where we operate.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Changes in tax laws or tax rates in those jurisdictions could have a material impact on our operating results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The Company s effective tax rate may also be impacted by tax holidays and other various tax credits granted by local taxing authorities.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	All incentives, including a tax holiday granted to our Malaysian subsidiary, are subject to certain terms and conditions.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	While we expect to comply with these conditions, we would experience adverse tax consequences if we are found to not be in compliance or if the terms and conditions of the tax holiday are unfavorably altered by the local taxing authorities.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company s taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon the local taxing authority s acceptance of our operational and intercompany transfer pricing practices as being at arm s length.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Due to inconsistencies among jurisdictions in the application of the arm s length standard, the Company s transfer pricing methods may be challenged and, if not upheld, could increase our income tax expense.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Risks associated with transfer pricing adjustments are further highlighted by the global initiative from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) called the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ( BEPS ) project.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The BEPS project is challenging longstanding international tax norms regarding the taxation of profits from cross-border business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Given the scope of the Company's international operations and the fluid and uncertain nature of how the BEPS project might ultimately lead to future legislation, it is difficult to assess how any changes in tax laws would impact the Company s income tax expense.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income by jurisdiction.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in each of our jurisdictions may require the creation of an additional valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction to adjust to customers needs and market demands.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, as well as fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these decisions, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Expansion and consolidation, including the transfer of operations to larger facilities or acquisitions, can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In fiscal 2016, we ceased volume manufacturing at a facility in Livingston, Scotland and closed our Fremont, California facility, moving customer programs from those sites to other Plexus facilities.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	If we are unable to effectively manage our recent or future expansions and consolidations, or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, we may expand our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Other risks of current or future expansions, acquisitions and consolidations include:
785786_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the expansion.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entail short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	When we make decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring charges, as we did in fiscal 2016 related to the actions discussed above and in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 in connection with the replacement of facilities in the U.S. and Mexico.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, to meet our customers needs, particularly when the production requirements of certain products are site-specific, or to achieve increased efficiencies, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Since customers needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We may also encounter situations where our lack of a physical presence in certain locations may limit or foreclose opportunities.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P34_S6	An inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, may adversely affect our business and reputation.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P34_S7	As a global company with a complex business model, we are heavily dependent on our information systems to support our customers requirements and to successfully manage our business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to system and data security, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our information systems, like those of other companies, are susceptible to malicious damage, intrusions and outages due to, among other events, viruses, cyber threats, industrial espionage (internal or external), hacking, break-ins and similar events, other breaches of security, natural disasters, power loss or telecommunications failures.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency, redundancy and recovery processes, as well as by purchasing insurance; however, these measures may be inadequate.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Any operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of our or our customers financial, product or other confidential information, result in adverse regulatory or other legal actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Brexit and related negative developments in the European Union could adversely affect our business and financial results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P35_S5	In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union, which resulted in significant currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility late in fiscal 2016.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P35_S6	The British government is expected to commence negotiations related to the terms of Brexit.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P35_S7	Given the lack of comparable precedent, the implications of Brexit, or how such implications might affect the Company, are unclear at this time.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Brexit could, among other impacts, disrupt trade and the movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other countries, disrupt the stability of the European Union generally, as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	These and other potential implications could adversely affect the Company s business and financial results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In the Brexit referendum, Scotland voted to remain in the European Union, while England and Wales voted to exit.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The disparity may renew the Scottish independence movement.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Political issues and a potential breakup of the United Kingdom could create legal and economic uncertainty in the region and have a material adverse effect on the Company, which has operations in Scotland.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations and industry standards; a failure to comply with current and future regulations and standards could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We are subject to extensive government regulation and industry standards (as well as customer-specific standards) relating to the products we design and manufacture as well as how we conduct our business, including regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support and many other facets of our operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	such regulations or standards could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As a publicly-held company, we are subject to increasingly stringent laws, regulations and other requirements, including those affecting, among other areas, our accounting, internal controls, data protection, corporate governance practices, securities disclosures and reporting.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly aggressive in adopting and enforcing anti-corruption laws.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, among others, apply to us and our operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Affordable Care Act significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the U.S. and is expected to impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is subject to statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety, including Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulations and similar regulations in other countries.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Failure to comply with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of devices, or total or partial suspension of production.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We also design and manufacture products for customers in the defense, security and aerospace industries.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Companies that design and manufacture products for these industries face significant regulation by the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Commerce, Federal Aviation Authority, and other governmental agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries, and also under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, whenever we pursue business in new sectors and subsectors, or our customers pursue new technologies or markets, we need to navigate the potentially heavy regulatory and legislative burdens of such sectors, technologies or markets.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	For example, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, as well as the financial health of health care providers, and pending changes in how health care in the U.S. is structured, including as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in this sector as well as impact our margins.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Our customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards, including many of the industry-specific regulations discussed above.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Our customers' failure to comply could affect their businesses, which in turn would affect our sales to them.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	In addition, if our customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs for these customers and create inefficiencies in our business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S5	A failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, and third party certification requirements or standards, including those related to social responsibility, could adversely affect our business and reputation.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S6	In addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own social responsibility, conflict minerals, quality or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S7	Such policies or standards may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third party organizations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S8	The Company is a member of the EICC.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S9	The EICC is a non-profit coalition of electronics companies and establishes standards for its members in responsible and ethical practices in the areas of labor, environmental compliance, employee health and safety, ethics and social responsibility.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S10	Our compliance with these policies, standards and third party certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P45_S11	In addition, our adoption of these standards could adversely affect our cost competiveness, ability to provide customers with required service levels and ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	There may be problems with the products we design or manufacture that could result in liability claims against us, reduced demand for our services and damage to our reputation.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The products that we design or manufacture may be subject to liability or claims in the event that defects are discovered or alleged.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We design and manufacture products to our customers specifications, many of which are highly complex, and produce products for industries, such as health care, defense and aerospace, that tend to have higher risk profiles.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the design or manufacturing of these products, including as a result of business continuity issues.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Whether or not we are responsible, problems in the products we manufacture, whether real or alleged, whether caused by faulty customer specifications, the design or manufacturing processes or a component defect, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S4	If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S5	In addition, such problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S6	These potential claims may include damages for the recall of a product or injury to person or property.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S7	Even if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S8	While we seek to insure against many of these risks, insurance coverage may be inadequate, not cost effective or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products or issues.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S9	We occasionally incur costs defending claims, and any such disputes could adversely affect our business relationships.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S10	Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S11	Our design and manufacturing services and the products offered by our customers involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S12	In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S13	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S14	In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S15	We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S16	Infringement by our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and disrupt our production.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S17	Additionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S18	Such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products, and could affect our customer relationships more broadly.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P47_S19	Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and components upon which we rely.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Increased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We compete against numerous providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of designing and manufacturing products internally and may choose to design or manufacture products themselves rather than outsource such activities.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Consolidations and other changes in our industry may result in a changing competitive landscape.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	be better positioned to compete on price for their services.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or otherwise become increasingly competitive.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or loss of market share.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Most of our services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts or orders.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P51_S2	A customer s cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Engineering changes by a customer may result in obsolete materials or components.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory and require customers to reimburse us for these items, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or be able to collect on these obligations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Excess or obsolete inventory, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P52_S4	These managed inventory programs result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to the risk of enforcing those obligations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P52_S6	We may experience raw material and component shortages and price fluctuations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P52_S7	We generally do not have long-term supply agreements.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P52_S8	We have experienced, and in the future may experience, raw material and component shortages due to supplier capacity constraints or their failure to deliver.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P52_S9	We also could experience disruptions in energy supplies.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P52_S10	Such constraints can also be caused by world events, such as government policies, terrorism, armed conflict, natural disasters, economic recession and other localized events.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used in the assembly process and, in some cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular raw material or component.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Such suppliers may encounter quality problems, labor disputes, financial difficulties or business continuity issues that could preclude them from delivering raw materials or components timely or at all.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Supply shortages and delays in deliveries of raw materials or components have in some cases resulted in delayed production of assemblies, which have increased our inventory levels and adversely affected our operating results in certain periods.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S3	An inability to obtain sufficient inventory on a timely basis could also harm relationships with our customers.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S4	In addition, raw materials and components that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Certain materials provided to us may be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S6	The need to obtain replacement materials and parts may negatively affect our manufacturing operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S7	The inadvertent use of any such parts or products may also give rise to liability claims.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S8	Raw material and component supply shortages and delays in deliveries can also result in increased pricing.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S9	While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in raw material or component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S10	Conversely, as a result of our pricing strategies and practices, raw material and component price reductions have contributed positively to our operating results in the past.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S11	Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S12	We depend on our workforce, including certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel or other personnel disruptions, including the inability to hire and retain sufficient personnel, may harm our business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S13	Our success depends in large part on the continued services of our key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, particularly highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of products.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S14	The competition for these individuals is significant, and the loss of key employees could harm our business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S15	From time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, promotions, transitions, disability, death and other terminations of service that affect our executive officers and other key employees.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S16	For example, in September 2016, our Chief Executive Officer retired and was succeeded by our former Chief Operating Officer pursuant to a previously announced succession plan, and in October 2016, we appointed a new Chief Operating Officer.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S17	Transitions or other changes in responsibilities among officers and key employees, particularly those that are unplanned, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, which could have an effect on our results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S18	We also depend on good relationships with our workforce generally.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P53_S19	Any disruption in our relationships with our personnel, including as a result of potential union organizing activities, work actions or other labor issues, could substantially affect our operations and results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In addition, when we expand operations in either existing areas or new locations, including internationally, we need to attract and retain the services of sufficient qualified personnel to conduct those operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	If we fail to retain and maintain sufficient qualified personnel, the operations at those locations, and consequently our financial results, could be adversely affected.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	In new or existing facilities we may be subject to local labor practices or union activities, wage pressure and changing wage requirements, increasing health care costs, differing employment laws and regulations in various countries, local competition for employees, restrictions on labor mobility as well as high turnover, and other issues affecting our workforce, all of which could affect operations at particular locations, which also could have adverse effects on our operational results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	As noted above, our adoption of certain third-party standards could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Natural disasters, breaches of security and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis and floods.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	For example, in late 2016, we suffered losses, primarily inventory-related, at our facility in Xiamen, China as a result of a typhoon.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	All facilities are subject to other natural or man-made disasters such as those related to global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism or war, breaches of security, theft or espionage, and failures of utilities.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If such an event was to occur, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P56_S4	If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and thus negatively affect our relationships and financial results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P56_S6	Although we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to physical security, we remain at risk of unauthorized access to our facilities and the possible unauthorized use or theft of inventory, information or other physical assets.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P56_S7	If unauthorized persons gain physical access to our facilities, or our physical assets or information are stolen or used in an unauthorized manner (whether through outside theft or industrial espionage), we could be subject to, among other consequences, negative publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, loss of government contracts, litigation by affected parties or other future financial obligations related to the loss, misuse or theft of our or our customers' data, inventory or physical assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We may fail to secure or maintain necessary additional financing or capital.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We cannot be certain that our existing credit facilities will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	In addition, if we do not comply with the covenants under our credit agreement, our ability to borrow under that facility would be adversely affected.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S3	In addition, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit agreement and our interest rate swap agreements, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations, either due to instability in the global financial markets or otherwise.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S5	In fiscal 2016, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase its capacity by $35 million to $300 million, with the potential to increase capacity to $500 million with the approval of the lenders.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S6	In addition, we also have a receivables factoring program.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S7	Many of our borrowings are at variable interest rates and therefore our interest expense is subject to increase if rates, including LIBOR, increase.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S8	We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining new facilities, or through a combination of these methods.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S9	We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S10	If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders ownership interests; we may not be able to offer our securities on attractive or acceptable terms in the event of volatility or weakness in our stock price.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P57_S11	Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any current or future financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions, as well as strategic arrangements, and may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or recognize the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We have previously grown, in part, through acquisitions and strategic arrangements.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	If we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions or similar transactions, this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	These risks include: Operating risks, such as:
785786_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	the loss of key employees of acquired businesses.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	the unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Changes in financial accounting standards may significantly effect our financial condition or the way we conduct business.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P62_S3	From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P62_S4	For example, significant changes to revenue recognition rules have been enacted and under current proposals will begin to apply to us in fiscal 2019.
785786_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Changes to accounting rules or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators may have a material effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business.
785786_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facilities comprise an integrated network of engineering and manufacturing centers with our corporate headquarters located in Neenah, Wisconsin.
785786_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own or lease active facilities with approximately 3.3 million square feet of capacity.
785786_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	This includes approximately 1.5 million square feet in AMER, approximately 1.4 million square feet in APAC and approximately 0.4 million square feet in EMEA.
785786_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	Our facilities as of October 1, 2016 , are described in the following table:
785786_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) The facilities in Penang, Malaysia; Xiamen, China; and Buffalo Grove, Illinois include more than one building.
785786_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	(2) As previously announced, construction of a new Neenah Design Center, located across the street from Plexus Global Headquarters, is expected to be completed in fiscal 2017.
785786_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	During the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, the current Neenah Design Center was sold and subsequently leased through the completion of construction of the new building.
785786_16_ITEM2_P1_S3	In August 2016, Plexus closed the Fremont, California facility and transitioned customer programs to other facilities.
785786_16_ITEM2_P1_S4	The facility in Fremont, California is subleased and is no longer used in operations.
785786_16_ITEM2_P1_S5	The lease on this facility expires in fiscal 2020.
785786_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is party to certain lawsuits and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
785786_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management does not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
785786_16_ITEM4_P0_S0	Executive Officers See Part III, Item 10, "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance," of this Form 10-K for information regarding the Company's executive officers.

785786_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	We have not paid any cash dividends in the past.
785786_16_ITEM5_P2_S2	We currently anticipate that in the foreseeable future the majority of earnings will be retained to finance the development of our business and our authorized share repurchases.
785786_16_ITEM5_P2_S3	However, the Company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include additional share repurchases, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_16_ITEM5_P2_S4	See also Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources, for a discussion of the Company s intentions regarding dividends, and loan covenants which could restrict dividend payments.
785786_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table provides the specified information about the repurchases of shares by the Company during the three months ended October 1, 2016 :
785786_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	(1) On August 20, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock during fiscal 2016.
785786_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	The Company repurchased 760,903 shares under this program for $30.0 million at an average price of $39.43 per share.
785786_16_ITEM5_P4_S2	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_16_ITEM5_P4_S3	On June 6, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a multi-year stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150.0 million of its common stock beginning in fiscal 2017.
785786_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) During fiscal 2016, the Company recorded $7.0 million in restructuring and other charges and $5.2 million in selling and administrative expenses, which are included in operating income.
785786_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	The $7.0 million was largely related to the Company's closure of its manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, and the partial closure of its Livingston, Scotland facility.
785786_16_ITEM6_P0_S2	The $5.2 million was related to accelerated stock-based compensation expense recorded pursuant to the previously announced retirement agreement with the Company's former Chief Executive Officer.
785786_16_ITEM6_P0_S3	During fiscal 2015 and 2014 the Company recorded $1.7 million and $11.3 million, respectively, of restructuring and other charges, largely related to the Company's consolidation of its manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin, as well as its relocation of manufacturing operations from Juarez, Mexico to Guadalajara, Mexico.
785786_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	No. 2015-17, which requires all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to be classified as non-current and ASU No. 2015-03, which requires unamortized debt issuance costs to be presented as a contra liability.
785786_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	The adoptions resulted in decreased total assets of $10.6 million, $7.1 million, $3.5 million and $5.0 million for fiscal 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
785786_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	Refer to New Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 - Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_16_ITEM6_P4_S0	(3) The Company defines return on invested capital ("ROIC"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as tax-effected operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period.
785786_16_ITEM6_P4_S1	For a reconciliation of ROIC and Economic Return to our financial statements that were prepared in accordance with GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K. (4) In fiscal 2012, the Company established a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets resulting in an additional tax provision of approximately $20.6 million ($22.8 million provision, offset by $2.2 million recorded to other comprehensive income) and a decrease in diluted earnings per share of $0.64.
785786_16_ITEM6_P4_S2	Return on invested capital excludes the $20.6 million net deferred tax asset reduction.
785786_16_ITEM6_P4_S3	An additional $1.3 million of valuation allowance established for fiscal 2012 relates to operating losses in Germany and Romania, making the total valuation allowance for that year $24.1 million.

785786_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Performance Summary.
785786_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions, except per share data):
785786_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2016 decreased $98.3 million , or 3.7% , as compared to fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	The net sales decrease was primarily the result of a $247.4 million decrease in net sales in the Networking/Communications sector, which was partially offset by increased net sales of $88.7 million, $30.3 million and $30.1 million in the Industrial/Commercial, Defense/Security/Aerospace and Healthcare/Life Sciences sectors, respectively.
785786_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2015 increased $276.0 million, or 11.6%, as compared to fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	The net sales increase was primarily the result of increases across all market sectors.
785786_16_ITEM7_P4_S4	The most significant net sales increases were from the Industrial/Commercial and Networking/Communications sectors, which increased by $102.0 million and $82.0 million, respectively.
785786_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our net sales by market sector for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in millions):
785786_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector increased $30.1 million , or 4.0% , as compared to fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	The increase was primarily due to a $41.9 million increase in net sales due to the ramp of various new programs for several existing customers, $26.4 million from the ramp of production for three new customers and a net increase in end-market demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	Partially offsetting the increases were decreases in net sales of $20.3 million due to three customers bringing the manufacturing process for four programs in house, $7.0 million due to two customer disengagements and $5.5 million due to a product disengagement with a customer.
785786_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector increased $52.9 million, or 7.6%, as compared to fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P6_S4	The increase was primarily due to $39.6 million of new program ramps for one customer, increased end-market demand and new program ramps across several other customers in this sector.
785786_16_ITEM7_P6_S5	The increase was partially offset by a program loss for one customer, which resulted in a decrease of $14.6 million, and decreased net sales to several other customers as a result of program ramp downs and decreased end-market demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the Industrial/Commercial sector increased $88.7 million , or 12.9% , as compared to fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	The increase was primarily due to ramps of production for a major customer, which resulted in increased net sales of $221.2 million.
785786_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	Partially offsetting the increase were decreases of $42.7 million related to the previously announced disengagement of a customer, $30.2 million that resulted from two customers revising their business models as a result of decreased end-market demand and $12.4 million due to pilot programs for three customers not transitioning into the production stage.
785786_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	The remaining decrease was due to decreased customer end-market demand, due in part to the downturn in the oil and gas markets.
785786_16_ITEM7_P7_S4	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the Industrial/Commercial sector increased $102.0 million, or 17.5%, as compared to fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P7_S5	The increase was primarily due to a $45.6 million increase in net sales to a new customer in fiscal 2015, a $36.8 million increase related to new programs with existing customers, a $24.4 million increase related to new customers secured in fiscal 2014 that ramped in fiscal 2015, and several other customers with increased end-market demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P7_S6	These increases were partially offset by a $22.1 million decrease due to the disengagement of a customer as a result of the inability to reach contractual terms, and several other customers with decreased end-market demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the Networking/Communications sector decreased $247.4 million , or 29.3% , as compared to fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	The reduction in net sales was primarily driven by a $90.7 million decrease in net sales due to a previously announced program disengagement, a $75.8 million decrease in net sales to another customer that resulted from decreased end-market demand for one of its products and a $29.2 million decrease due to the disengagement of a customer.
785786_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	Overall decreased end-market demand drove the remaining reduction in net sales during the year.
785786_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	Partially offsetting the decreases was a $10.2 million increase in net sales due to the ramp of production of new programs for two existing customers.
785786_16_ITEM7_P8_S4	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the Networking/Communications sector increased $82.0 million, or 10.8%, as compared to fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P8_S5	The change was primarily the result of a $50.1 million increase in net sales to a key customer as a result of increased end-market demand, a $36.1 million increase in net sales from one of our largest customers as a result of new product ramps and expansion of its end-market demand, and a $16.0 million increase related to a new customer.
785786_16_ITEM7_P8_S6	Additionally, five customers' net sales increased $37.5 million, in aggregate, primarily as a result of increased end-market demand as well as new program ramps.
785786_16_ITEM7_P8_S7	These increases were partially offset by a $19.8 million decrease due to a customer that experienced softening in its end-market demand, a $10.6 million decrease related to a customer disengagement and several other customers with decreased end-market demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the Defense/Security/Aerospace sector increased $30.3 million , or 8.1% , as compared to fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The improvement was primarily attributable to increased net sales of $43.2 million that resulted from the ramp of production of new programs for several existing customers.
785786_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6.9 million due to program disengagements with two customers as well as a net decrease in customer end-market demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the Defense/Security/Aerospace sector increased $39.2 million, or 11.7%, as compared to fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase was primarily driven by new program ramps and increased end-market demand spread among multiple customers.
785786_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	As a percentage of consolidated net sales, net sales attributable to customers representing 10% or more of consolidated net sales as well as the percentage of net sales attributable to our ten largest customers for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , were as follows:
785786_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Cost of sales for fiscal 2016 decreased $86.1 million , or 3.6% , as compared to fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, labor costs, and overhead.
785786_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	During fiscal 2016 and 2015 , approximately 90.0% of the total cost of sales was variable in nature and fluctuated with sales volumes.
785786_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Of this amount, approximately 88.0% of these costs were related to material and component costs.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	As a result of using a cost-plus markup pricing arrangement with our customers, changes in costs typically result in corresponding changes in price, which generally results in an immaterial impact on gross profit.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Therefore, as expected, the decrease in cost of sales of 3.6% as compared to fiscal 2015 was generally in line with the 3.7% decrease in net sales.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Cost of sales decreased slightly less than the decrease in net sales primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in cost of sales that resulted from losses sustained from a typhoon that impacted the Company's manufacturing facilities in Xiamen, China during the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	Cost of sales for fiscal 2015 increased $262.1 million , or 12.2% , as compared to fiscal 2014 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	The increase in cost of sales of 12.2% was generally in line with the 11.6% increase in net sales.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S5	The increase in cost of sales as compared to the net sales increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to increased salary and wages expense in a Defense/Security/Aerospace focus factory resulting from additional direct and fixed labor resources in our cost structure to improve quality and delivery for some of our customers.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S6	Direct labor costs increased by $1.8 million in fiscal 2015 due in large part to the employee mix shifting from temporary to permanent labor resources.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S7	In fiscal 2015, we also incurred an additional $1.7 million in consulting fees to bring temporary, experienced quality inspectors in to enhance our manufacturing processes.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S8	Finally, an additional $4.5 million of fixed labor resources were added throughout fiscal 2015 to provide support for manufacturing and quality control for the more complex assemblies and processes in the sector.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S9	Gross profit for fiscal 2016 decreased $12.2 million , or 5.1% , as compared to fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S10	Gross margin decreased 10 basis points as compared to fiscal 2015.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S11	The primary driver of the decreases in gross profit and gross margin as compared to fiscal 2015 was the decrease in net sales and the $2.9 million increase in cost of sales due to the typhoon-related losses previously discussed.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S12	Gross profit for fiscal 2015 increased $14.0 million, or 6.2%, as compared to fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S13	Gross profit increased $28.4 million primarily as a result of increased sales.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S14	This was partially offset by a $14.4 million increase in fixed costs primarily in the AMER region as a result of continued investments in our then-new manufacturing facilities in Neenah, Wisconsin and Guadalajara, Mexico and costs incurred related to production process constraints in a Defense/Security/Aerospace focus factory.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S15	Gross margin decreased to 9.0% from 9.5%.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S16	The largest driver of the decrease in gross margin percentage from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was a lower net parts contribution margin and lower labor contribution margin due to increased labor expenses previously discussed.
785786_16_ITEM7_P13_S17	These decreases were partially offset by lower fixed costs as a percentage of net sales that resulted primarily from better leveraged fixed costs.
785786_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Operating income for fiscal 2016 decreased $16.0 million as compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of the decrease in gross profit previously discussed and a $5.3 million increase in restructuring and other charges, partially offset by a $1.5 million reduction in selling and administrative expenses ("S A").
785786_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Restructuring and other charges were higher in fiscal 2016 largely due to the closure of our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California and the partial closure of our Livingston, Scotland facility to align with reduced end-market demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	The reduction in S A resulted from a $6.4 million decrease in variable compensation expense, which was partially offset by a $5.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to $5.2 million of accelerated stock-based compensation expense related to modifications of awards held by the Company's former President and Chief Executive Officer in connection with his retirement.
785786_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	Operating margin decreased to 3.9% in fiscal 2016 from 4.3% in fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Operating income for fiscal 2015 increased $14.8 million as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of the increase in gross profit previously discussed and a $9.6 million decrease in restructuring and other charges, which were higher in fiscal 2014 because they largely related to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin, and the relocation of manufacturing operations from Juarez, Mexico to Guadalajara.
785786_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	This was partially offset by an $8.7 million increase in S A primarily due to increased variable compensation expense, higher compensation expense due to increased headcount and an increase in professional services expense.
785786_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	Operating margin increased to 4.3% for fiscal 2015 from 4.2% for fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	Other expense for fiscal 2016 increased $2.9 million as compared to fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P15_S4	The increase in other expense for fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of a $3.0 million increase in foreign exchange losses that resulted from foreign exchange volatility.
785786_16_ITEM7_P15_S5	Other expense for fiscal 2015 increased $1.9 million as compared to fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P15_S6	The increase in other expense for fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of a $1.7 million increase in interest expense due to higher average borrowings, a $0.8 million increase in miscellaneous expense due to fiscal 2014 having benefited from a favorable non-recurring accrual related to the termination of an agreement for additional land in Hangzhou, China, and an additional $1.4 million increase in other miscellaneous expenses.
785786_16_ITEM7_P15_S7	This was partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in foreign exchange gains and a $0.6 million increase in interest income due to an increase of cash and cash equivalents.
785786_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Income tax expense and effective annual income tax rates for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Income tax expense for fiscal 2016 was $11.0 million compared to $12.0 million for fiscal 2015 and $6.1 million for fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	The Company's annual effective tax rates vary from the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0% primarily as a result of the mix of earnings from U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and a tax holiday granted to a subsidiary located in the APAC region where the Company derives a significant portion of its earnings.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of the overall decrease in income before taxes in jurisdictions where the Company does not pay taxes.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings and tax benefits of $3.8 million primarily due to the lapse of statute of limitations related to certain U.S. tax examinations during fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S4	During fiscal 2016, the Company repatriated $100.0 million of current year foreign earnings from the APAC region to the U.S., which had no income statement impact due to U.S. net operating losses, the use of U.S. tax credits and the reversal of the related valuation allowance.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S5	The repatriation does not impact the permanently reinvested assertions made by the Company regarding prior period foreign earnings as the remittance was distributed exclusively from current year foreign earnings.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S6	The Company does not have a history of repatriating foreign earnings by way of a taxable dividend and considers the fiscal 2016 remittance to be an isolated occurrence.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S7	The Company does not anticipate a similar repatriation in the foreseeable future.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S8	The Company has been granted a tax holiday for a foreign subsidiary operating in the APAC region.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S9	This tax holiday will expire on December 31, 2024, and is subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S10	The Company benefited from a second tax holiday within the APAC region until December 31, 2013, when it expired under the terms of the Company's agreement with the local taxing authority.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S11	In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, these holidays resulted in tax reductions of approximately $27.1 million ($0.81 per basic share), $29.9 million ($0.89 per basic share), and $24.1 million ($0.71 per basic share), respectively.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S12	See also Note 6, "Income Taxes," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's tax rate.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S13	The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 is expected to be approximately 9.0% to 11.0%.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S14	Net income for fiscal 2016 decreased $17.9 million , or 19.0% , to $76.4 million from fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S15	Net income decreased primarily as a result of decreased gross profit, increased restructuring and other charges and increased foreign exchange losses, partially offset by decreases in S A and income tax expense, as discussed previously.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S16	Net income for fiscal 2015 increased $7.1 million, or 8.2%, to $94.3 million from fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P17_S17	Net income increased primarily as a result of increased gross profit and lower restructuring and other charges, partially offset by increases in S A, interest expense and income tax expense, as discussed previously.
785786_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Diluted earnings per share decreased to $2.24 in fiscal 2016 from $2.74 in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of decreased net income.
785786_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	This was partially offset by the positive impact of fewer weighted average outstanding shares in fiscal 2016 due to our common stock repurchase program.
785786_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	See Note 13, "Shareholders' Equity," in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's stock repurchase programs.
785786_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.74 for fiscal 2015 from $2.52 for fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of increased net income.
785786_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Further improvement was attributable to the positive impact of fewer weighted average outstanding shares in fiscal 2015 due to our common stock repurchase program.
785786_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Return on Invested Capital ( ROIC ) and Economic Return.
785786_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	We use a financial model that is aligned with our business strategy and includes a ROIC goal of 500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ), which we refer to as Economic Return, and a 4.7% to 5.0% operating margin target.
785786_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	Our primary focus is on our Economic Return goal of 5.0%, which is designed to create shareholder value and generate sufficient cash to self-fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of 12.0%.
785786_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	ROIC and Economic Return are non-GAAP financial measures.
785786_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC and Economic Return, are used for internal management goals and decision making because such measures provide management and investors additional insight into financial performance.
785786_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	In particular, we provide ROIC and Economic Return because we believe they offer insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view ROIC and Economic Return as important measures in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital requirements.
785786_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	We also use a derivative measure of ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation.
785786_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	We define ROIC as tax-effected operating income before restructuring and other special items divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period for the fiscal year.
785786_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents.
785786_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way.
785786_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	ROIC and other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
785786_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually.
785786_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Our WACC was 11.0% for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders.
785786_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	ROIC was 13.8% , 14.0% , and 15.2% for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and was calculated excluding special items of $15.1 million for fiscal 2016 related to accelerated stock-based compensation expense due to the retirement of our former President and Chief Executive Officer, typhoon-related losses and restructuring and other charges.
785786_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	Fiscal 2015 and 2014 ROIC was calculated excluding $1.7 million and $11.3 million of restructuring and other charges, respectively.
785786_16_ITEM7_P24_S5	Fiscal 2016 ROIC of 13.8% reflects an Economic Return of 2.8%, based on our weighted average cost of capital of 11.0%.
785786_16_ITEM7_P24_S6	For a reconciliation of ROIC, Economic Return and adjusted operating income (tax effected) to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
785786_16_ITEM7_P24_S7	Refer to the table below, which includes the calculation of ROIC and Economic Return (dollars in millions) for the indicated periods:
785786_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	REPORTABLE SEGMENTS A further discussion of our fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 financial performance by reportable segment is presented below (in millions):
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the AMER segment decreased $60.2 million , or 4.3% , as compared to fiscal 2015 , primarily due to decreased net sales of $75.8 million with a customer that resulted from decreased end-market demand for one of its products, $42.7 million due to a previously announced customer disengagement and $29.2 million due to the disengagement of a customer.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The remaining reduction in net sales resulted from decreases of: $17.4 million due to two customers bringing the manufacturing process of three programs in house; $12.4 million due to pilot programs for three customers not transitioning into the production stage; $5.5 million due to a product disengagement with one customer; and a net overall decrease in customer end-market demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	Partially offsetting these decreases were increased net sales of $187.3 million due to the ramp of production for a major customer, $59.8 million from the ramp of various new programs for several existing customers and $10.4 million due to the ramp of production for a new customer.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	Operating income for fiscal 2016 decreased $3.7 million, or 5.4%, as compared to fiscal 2015, driven primarily by decreased net sales.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S4	The impact of the net sales decrease was partially offset by a positive change in customer mix due in part to decreased net sales to lower margin customers that resulted from two customer disengagements.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S5	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the AMER segment increased $150.8 million, or 12.2%, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to a then-new Industrial/Commercial sector customer that ramped during fiscal 2015, which contributed $45.6 million in sales, and a $37.2 million increase in net sales from a customer in the Networking/Communications sector as a result of new product ramps and expansion of its end-market demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S6	The remainder of the increase was a result of increased end-market demand and new product ramps for several of our larger customers across the Industrial/Commercial and Healthcare/Life Sciences sectors.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S7	These increases were partially offset by the disengagement of a customer due to the inability to reach contractual terms, which resulted in a $22.1 million decrease.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S8	There was also a $19.8 million decrease due to a customer that experienced softening in its end-market demand, a $14.6 million decrease due to the loss of a customer program, and softening end-market demand for several customers, particularly in the Networking/Communications sector.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S9	During fiscal 2015, production of a Healthcare/Life Sciences customer was transferred from the AMER segment to the APAC segment, which resulted in a decrease of $8.4 million (sales to this customer increased by $47.0 million in the APAC segment, as noted below).
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S10	Operating income for fiscal 2015 decreased $10.6 million from fiscal 2014 primarily due to continued investments in our new manufacturing facilities in Neenah and Guadalajara and costs related to production process constraints in a focus factory for our Defense/Security/Aerospace sector, partially offset by the impact of the increase in net sales.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S11	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the APAC segment decreased $124.0 million , or 9.6% , as compared to fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S12	The reduction in net sales was primarily driven by a $90.7 million decrease in net sales due to a previously announced program disengagement.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S13	Net sales also declined by $30.2 million due to two customers revising their business models as a result of decreased end-market demand and $7.0 million due to two customer disengagements.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S14	The remaining decrease in net sales was due to a net decrease in customer end-market demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S15	These decreases were partially offset by increased net sales of $76.5 million from the ramp of new programs for three existing customers and $19.4 million from the ramp of production for two new customers.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S16	Operating income decreased $4.7 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 , primarily as a result of the decrease in net sales.
785786_16_ITEM7_P26_S17	The impact of the decrease in net sales was partially offset by a positive shift in net sales mix, partially due to a previously announced program disengagement, and a $4.7 million decrease in fixed manufacturing expenses due to cost saving initiatives.
785786_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the APAC segment increased $153.4 million, or 13.5%, as compared to fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Net sales increased in all market sectors with the most significant increase in the Networking/Communications sector, including a combined $62.8 million increase for three customers as a result of increased end-market demand and an aggregate $23.9 million increase related to program ramps for two customers.
785786_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	In addition, net sales to one of our largest customers in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector increased by $47.0 million.
785786_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	Operating income increased $24.7 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in net sales as fixed manufacturing expenses and S A for the segment were relatively stable in fiscal 2015 as compared to 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P27_S4	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the EMEA segment increased $30.1 million , or 21.5% , as compared to fiscal 2015 , primarily due to a $30.3 million increase in net sales due to the ramp of production of various new programs with several existing customers and $5.0 million from the ramp of production for a new customer.
785786_16_ITEM7_P27_S5	This was partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease as a result of a customer bringing the manufacturing of a program in house.
785786_16_ITEM7_P27_S6	The remaining decrease in net sales was due to a net decrease in customer end-market demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P27_S7	Operating loss decreased $4.4 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the impact of the net sales increase, while fixed costs remained relatively flat.
785786_16_ITEM7_P27_S8	Net sales for fiscal 2015 in the EMEA segment increased $24.4 million, or 21.1%, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to a combined increase of $18.7 million from three new customers, a $7.3 million increase to a Networking/Communications customer due to improved end-market demand and new product ramps, and increased end-market demand for several other customers.
785786_16_ITEM7_P27_S9	This was partially offset by a $7.2 million decrease as a result of end of life products along with the effects of decreased end-market demand for several other customers.
785786_16_ITEM7_P27_S10	Operating loss decreased $3.8 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in net sales and improved profitability for engineering-related services.
785786_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents were $433.0 million as of October 1, 2016 as compared to $357.1 million as of October 3, 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	As of October 1, 2016 , 95.7% of our cash and cash equivalents balances were held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries.
785786_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Certain foreign countries impose taxes and overall penalties on transfers of cash.
785786_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	While our intent has been to permanently reinvest the funds held in these countries, from time to time we review and evaluate that strategy, particularly as the percentage of our cash balance held outside the U.S. has increased.
785786_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	During fiscal 2016, the Company repatriated $100.0 million of current year foreign earnings from the APAC region to the U.S., which had no income statement impact due to U.S. net operating losses, the use of U.S. tax credits and the reversal of the related valuation allowance.
785786_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	The repatriation does not impact the permanently reinvested assertions made by the Company regarding prior period foreign earnings as the remittance was distributed exclusively from current year foreign earnings.
785786_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	The Company does not have a history of repatriating foreign earnings by way of a taxable dividend and considers the fiscal 2016 remittance to be an isolated occurrence.
785786_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	The Company does not anticipate a similar repatriation in the foreseeable future.
785786_16_ITEM7_P30_S4	Currently, we believe that cash held in the U.S., together with cash available under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.
785786_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	The following table provides a summary of cash flows for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , excluding the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (in millions):
785786_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $127.7 million for fiscal 2016 , as compared to $76.6 million for fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The improvement was primarily due to increased working capital requirements in fiscal 2015 due to the increase in net sales.
785786_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	This was partially offset by the larger increase in cash flows received for customer deposits in fiscal 2015 (discussed below) and the decrease in earnings in fiscal 2016.
785786_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $76.6 million for fiscal 2015 , as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $88.4 million for fiscal 2014 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P32_S4	The decrease was primarily attributable to a significant increase in accounts payable for fiscal 2014 and an increase in net sales to customers with longer payment terms, which resulted in higher accounts receivable balances at the end of fiscal 2015.
785786_16_ITEM7_P32_S5	This was partially offset by improvement in cash flows used for inventory as fiscal 2014 had a significant inventory increase due to the timing of our inventory build to support forecasted sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, coupled with an increase in customer deposits and improved earnings in fiscal 2015.
785786_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following table provides a summary of cash cycle days for the periods indicated (in days):
785786_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	We calculate days in accounts receivable as accounts receivable for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	We calculate days in inventory, accounts payable, and cash deposits as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	We calculate annualized cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits.
785786_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	Days in accounts receivable for the three months ended October 1, 2016 increased five days compared to the three months ended October 3, 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P34_S4	The increase is primarily attributable to increased net sales to customers with longer payment terms and the timing of payments.
785786_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Days in inventory for the three months ended October 1, 2016 increased two days compared to the three months ended October 3, 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	The increase is primarily driven by the decrease in annualized cost of sales due primarily to the decrease in net sales and relatively flat inventory levels as a result of demand reductions late in the fourth quarter, which did not allow inventory to decrease by year end in line with the net sales decrease.
785786_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	Days in accounts payable for the three months ended October 1, 2016 increased one day compared to the three months ended October 3, 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	The increase is primarily driven by the decrease in annualized cost of sales due primarily to the decrease in net sales and the timing of purchases.
785786_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	Days in cash deposits for the three months ended October 1, 2016 increased one day compared to the three months ended October 3, 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P35_S5	The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in customer deposits primarily due to a deposit received from one customer to offset on-hand inventory.
785786_16_ITEM7_P35_S6	As of October 1, 2016 annualized cash cycle days increased five days compared to October 3, 2015 due to the factors discussed above.
785786_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	We define free cash flow ( FCF ), a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash flow provided by operations less capital expenditures.
785786_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	FCF was $96.6 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $41.5 million for fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	The increase of $55.1 million was primarily attributable to the increase in cash provided by operating activities described above and the reduction in capital expenditures.
785786_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Non-GAAP financial measures, including FCF, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight to investors into ongoing financial performance.
785786_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	In particular, we provide FCF because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions.
785786_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	We view FCF as an important financial metric as it demonstrates our ability to generate cash and can allow us to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.
785786_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
785786_16_ITEM7_P37_S4	A reconciliation of FCF to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP follows (in millions):
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Cash flows used in investing activities were $26.5 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $34.7 million for fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	The reduction was due to a $4.0 million decrease in capital expenditures and a $4.2 million increase in proceeds received from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily related to the sale of our engineering facility in Neenah, Wisconsin.
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	Cash flows used in investing activities were $34.7 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $62.6 million for fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	The reduction was due to a $30.2 million decrease in capital expenditures primarily related to our facility investment for Guadalajara during fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S4	We utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal 2016 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S5	We currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 will be approximately $50 million to $60 million.
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S6	Cash flows used in financing activities were $21.3 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $26.2 million for fiscal 2015 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S7	The decrease was primarily attributable to the $5.0 million increase in proceeds received from increased stock option exercise activity during fiscal 2016.
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S8	Cash flows used in financing activities were $26.2 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $21.0 million for fiscal 2014.
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S9	The increase was primarily attributable to reduced proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2015.
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S10	On June 6, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a multi-year stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150.0 million of its common stock beginning in fiscal 2017.
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S11	We will repurchase shares subject to market conditions.
785786_16_ITEM7_P38_S12	On August 20, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock during fiscal 2016.
785786_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	program for $30.0 million , at an average price of $39.43 per share, during fiscal 2016 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	On August 13, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock during fiscal 2015.
785786_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	During fiscal 2015, the Company repurchased 745,227 shares under this program for $30.0 million , at an average price of $40.26 per share.
785786_16_ITEM7_P39_S4	These shares were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	On July 5, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") related to its senior unsecured credit facility (the "Credit Facility").
785786_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The amendment increased the maximum commitment under the Credit Facility from $265 million to $300 million, provides a potential additional $200 million increase in borrowing capacity to $500 million with the approval of the lenders, and extended the termination date of the facility from May 15, 2019, to July 5, 2021.
785786_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	Consistent with the terms of the Credit Facility prior to its amendment, borrowings under the Credit Facility as amended bear interest, at the Company s option, at a eurocurrency or base rate plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin based on the Company s then-current leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
785786_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	As of October 1, 2016 , the borrowing rate under the Credit Agreement was LIBOR plus 1.125% (or 1.648% ).
785786_16_ITEM7_P40_S4	The Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused revolver credit commitment based on the Company's leverage ratio; the fee was 0.175% as of October 1, 2016 .
785786_16_ITEM7_P40_S5	During fiscal 2016, the highest daily borrowing was $232.0 million , the average daily borrowings were $188.6 million , and the Company borrowed and repaid $625.0 million of revolving borrowings under the Credit Facility.
785786_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	The financial covenants (as defined under the Credit Agreement) require, among other covenants, that the Company maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
785786_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	As of October 1, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit Agreement.
785786_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	In fiscal 2011, Plexus issued $175.0 million in principal amount of 5.20% Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2018 (the "Notes").
785786_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	The related Note Purchase Agreement contains certain financial covenants, which include a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth test, all as defined in the agreement.
785786_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	As of October 1, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all such covenants relating to the Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement.
785786_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the repurchase of shares provided that no event of default (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases.
785786_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	We have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not currently anticipate paying them in the future.
785786_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	However, we evaluate from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases above those already authorized, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	On October 4, 2016, the Company entered into a Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement (the RPA ) with The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., New York Branch (the Purchaser ).
785786_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	Pursuant to the RPA, the Company, Plexus Malaysia and one or more additional Plexus subsidiaries that may be designed in the future (each, a Seller ) may sell to the Purchaser up to an aggregate of $100.0 million in accounts receivable owed to such Sellers by specified customers.
785786_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	In exchange, the Purchaser pays a purchase price for each purchased receivable equal to the net face value of the receivable less an agreed upon discount.
785786_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	The facility represented by the RPA is non-committed, meaning that the Company and each other Seller acknowledge that they have not paid a commitment or comparable fee to the Purchaser, and that the Purchaser does not have a continuing obligation to purchase any receivable from any Seller.
785786_16_ITEM7_P44_S4	The Purchaser will pay an agreed-upon servicing fee to each Seller with respect to each purchased receivable sold by such Seller, consistent with common market practices.
785786_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	The RPA contains representations, warranties, covenants, and termination events that are customary for factoring transactions of this type.
785786_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents, potential borrowings under the Credit Facility, and our leasing capabilities, should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months.
785786_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing.
785786_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources.
785786_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms.
785786_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings.
785786_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	Information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 1, 2016 (dollars in millions):
785786_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	1) Includes amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.
785786_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	As of October 1, 2016 , the outstanding balance was $75.0 million .
785786_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	The amounts listed above include interest; see Note 4 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	2) Includes $175.0 million in principal amount of Notes.
785786_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	The amounts listed above include interest; see Note 4 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	3) As of October 1, 2016 , purchase obligations consist primarily of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business.
785786_16_ITEM7_P49_S3	4) As of October 1, 2016 , other long-term obligations on the balance sheet included deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers, as well as other key employees, and an asset retirement obligation.
785786_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	We have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately $2.8 million , as of October 1, 2016 , related to unrecognized income tax benefits.
785786_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	The Company cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to these obligations.
785786_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	5) As of October 1, 2016 , other long-term obligations not on the balance sheet consisted of guarantees and a commitment for salary continuation and certain benefits in the event employment of one executive officer of the Company is terminated without cause.
785786_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	Excluded from the amounts disclosed are certain bonus and incentive compensation amounts, which would be paid on a prorated basis in the year of termination.
785786_16_ITEM7_P50_S4	6) Includes future minimum payments under the base lease agreement in Guadalajara, Mexico.
785786_16_ITEM7_P50_S5	Excludes $20.3 million of future minimum payments under renewal options from 2025 through 2034.
785786_16_ITEM7_P50_S6	See Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	During fiscal 2016 , there were no material changes to these policies.
785786_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Our more critical accounting estimates are described below: Revenue Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled.
785786_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling, if applicable.
785786_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with durations of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740.
785786_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
785786_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
785786_16_ITEM7_P57_S4	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_16_ITEM7_P57_S5	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
785786_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	We used the modified prospective application, under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income beginning with the first period that we adopted the FASB regulation and continuing to be expensed thereafter.
785786_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value stock options and the Monte Carlo valuation model to value performance stock units.
785786_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	See Note 9, "Benefit Plans," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Foreign Currency Risk We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the indicated fiscal years were as follows:
785786_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Based on the Company s overall currency exposure, as of October 1, 2016 , a 10.0 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have financial instruments, including cash equivalents, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions and have entered into interest rate swaps related to borrowings under our Credit Facility.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	For more information, refer to Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Interest rate swap agreements are subject to the further risk that the counterparties to these agreements may fail to comply with their obligations thereunder.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	To achieve this, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of highly rated securities, money market funds and certificates of deposit, and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P6_S2	As of October 1, 2016 , our only material interest rate risk is associated with our Credit Facility, which had an outstanding balance of $75 million.
785786_16_ITEM7A_P6_S3	As of the end of fiscal 2016, through the use of interest rate swaps, as described above, we fixed the basis on which we pay interest with a $75 million notional amount of interest rate swap contracts, and the borrowings under the Notes are based on a fixed interest rate, thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk.
785786_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	NOTE: All other financial statement schedules are omitted because they are not applicable or the required information is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto.
785786_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Plexus Corp.:
785786_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries at October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 1, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
785786_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
785786_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
785786_16_ITEM8_P2_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
785786_16_ITEM8_P2_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
785786_16_ITEM8_P2_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
785786_16_ITEM8_P2_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
785786_16_ITEM8_P2_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
785786_16_ITEM8_P2_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
785786_16_ITEM8_P2_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
785786_16_ITEM8_P2_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
785786_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred taxes in 2016.
785786_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
785786_16_ITEM8_P4_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
785786_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
785786_16_ITEM8_P5_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

785786_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
785786_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
785786_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
785786_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business: Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together Plexus or the Company, ) participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ( EMS ) industry.
785786_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	Plexus provides integrated product conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and sustaining solutions to customers in the Healthcare/Life Sciences, Industrial/Commercial, Networking/Communications and Defense/Security/Aerospace market sectors.
785786_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	Plexus is headquartered in Neenah, Wisconsin and has operations in the Americas ( AMER ), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA ) and Asia-Pacific ( APAC ) regions.
785786_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation Principles and Basis of Presentation:
785786_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include the accounts of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries.
785786_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
785786_16_ITEM8_P12_S2	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
785786_16_ITEM8_P12_S3	The Company s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.

785786_16_ITEM8_P14_S2	Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment.
785786_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond the Company s control.
785786_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory.
785786_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	Any actions taken by the Company s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.
785786_16_ITEM8_P15_S3	In certain instances, in accordance with contractual terms, the Company receives customer deposits to offset obsolete and excess inventory risks.
785786_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
785786_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Certain facilities and equipment held under capital leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities.
785786_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	Amortization of assets held under capital leases is included in depreciation expense (see Note 3, "Property, Plant and Equipment") and the financing component of the lease payments is classified as interest expense.
785786_16_ITEM8_P17_S2	Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
785786_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company capitalizes significant costs incurred in the acquisition or development of software for internal use.

785786_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups may not be recoverable through estimated future undiscounted cash flows.
785786_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a charge against current operations.
785786_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_16_ITEM8_P19_S3	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.
785786_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.
785786_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured products based on management s analysis of historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand.
785786_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling.
785786_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as program costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_16_ITEM8_P24_S3	Net sales from engineering design and development services were less than 5.0% of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .

785786_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes that would become payable upon the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
785786_16_ITEM8_P26_S3	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_16_ITEM8_P26_S4	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.
785786_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Foreign Currency Translation: The Company translates assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the relevant balance sheet date and net sales, expenses and cash flows at the average exchange rates during the respective periods.
785786_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Adjustments resulting from translation of the financial statements are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
785786_16_ITEM8_P27_S2	Exchange gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions were $(1.7) million , $1.3 million , and $(0.1) million for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

785786_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company periodically enters into forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
785786_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability (a non-designated hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge), or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.
785786_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
785786_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a non-designated hedge are recorded in earnings as are the gains or losses related to the hedged asset or liability.
785786_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
785786_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity.
785786_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	currency exchange contracts are treated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, $9.0 million , $(11.2) million and $1.6 million was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
785786_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Grants from Government Authorities: Grants from governments are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant funds will be received and the Company will comply with all attached conditions to the grant.
785786_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are recorded as an offset to the carrying value of the related assets at the time of capitalization.
785786_16_ITEM8_P33_S2	Government grants relating to other costs incurred are recognized as an offset to those related costs, for which the grants are intended to compensate for, at the time they are recognized.
785786_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Earnings Per Share: The computation of basic earnings per common share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and net income.
785786_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	The computation of diluted earnings per common share reflects additional dilution from share-based awards, excluding any with an antidilutive effect.
785786_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Stock-based Compensation: The Company measures all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, at fair value and expenses them in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.

785786_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Refer to Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," for further explanation regarding the change in fair value of derivative instruments, net of tax adjustments, that is recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
785786_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
785786_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
785786_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The Company holds financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, certain deferred compensation assets held under trust arrangements, accounts payable, debt, and derivatives.
785786_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and capital lease obligations as reported in the consolidated financial statements approximate fair value.
785786_16_ITEM8_P38_S2	Derivatives and certain deferred compensation assets held under a trust and a rabbi trust arrangement are recorded at fair value.
785786_16_ITEM8_P38_S3	Accounts receivable are reflected at net realizable value based on anticipated losses due to potentially uncollectible balances.
785786_16_ITEM8_P38_S4	Anticipated losses are based on management s analysis of historical losses and changes in customers credit status.
785786_16_ITEM8_P38_S5	The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was $251.4 million and $250.2 million as of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 , respectively.
785786_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company uses quoted market prices when available or discounted cash flows to calculate fair value.
785786_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described below.
785786_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
785786_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
785786_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.
785786_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	The input levels are: Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
785786_16_ITEM8_P42_S2	Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
785786_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.
785786_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Business and Credit Concentrations: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and derivative instruments, specifically related to counterparties.
785786_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	In accordance with the Company s investment policy, the Company s cash, cash equivalents and derivative instruments were placed with recognized financial institutions.
785786_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company s investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure in any one issue and the maturity date of the investment securities that typically comprise investment grade short-term debt instruments.
785786_16_ITEM8_P44_S3	The Company, at times, requires cash deposits for services performed.
785786_16_ITEM8_P44_S4	The Company also closely monitors extensions of credit.
785786_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements: In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.
785786_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid-in capital pools.
785786_16_ITEM8_P45_S2	The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting.
785786_16_ITEM8_P45_S3	In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis.
785786_16_ITEM8_P45_S4	The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
785786_16_ITEM8_P45_S5	The adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_16_ITEM8_P45_S6	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that primarily requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets but record expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting.
785786_16_ITEM8_P45_S7	For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases.
785786_16_ITEM8_P45_S8	The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
785786_16_ITEM8_P45_S9	The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of the new standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements and the timing of adoption.
785786_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes.
785786_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet, as opposed to being presented as current and non-current.
785786_16_ITEM8_P46_S2	This guidance is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
785786_16_ITEM8_P46_S3	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company elected to early adopt the guidance retrospectively.
785786_16_ITEM8_P46_S4	The adoption resulted in a reclassification of $10.7 million of current deferred income tax assets and $9.7 million of non-current deferred income tax liabilities to non-current deferred income tax assets in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of October 3, 2015.
785786_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued an amendment that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
785786_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Under the new guidance, the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs is not affected.
785786_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015.
785786_16_ITEM8_P47_S3	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company elected to early adopt the guidance retrospectively.
785786_16_ITEM8_P47_S4	The adoption resulted in a reclassification of $1.0 million of deferred financing costs from other non-current assets to long-term debt and capital lease obligations, net of current portion in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of October 3, 2015.
785786_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance for revenue recognition.
785786_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
785786_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance.
785786_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	This may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
785786_16_ITEM8_P49_S3	In July 2015 the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the standard.
785786_16_ITEM8_P49_S4	The new standard will become effective retrospectively for the Company for the fiscal first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted, but not before the original effective date (fiscal first quarter of 2018).
785786_16_ITEM8_P49_S5	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_16_ITEM8_P49_S6	The Company has determined that no other recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, or will not apply to its operations.

785786_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	Since the Company believes that it will exercise both renewal options, the lease is being accounted for using a 20 year lease term.
785786_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company capitalized the building shell in Guadalajara as a non-cash financing obligation of approximately $8.0 million , which will be increased by interest expense and land rent expense, and reduced by contractual payments.

785786_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company may from time to time be obligated to indemnify its customers or its customers customers against damages or liabilities arising out of the Company s negligence, misconduct, breach of contract, or infringement of third party intellectual property rights.
785786_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	Certain agreements have extended broader indemnification, and while most agreements have contractual limits, some do not.
785786_16_ITEM8_P113_S2	However, the Company generally does not provide for such indemnities and seeks indemnification from its customers for damages or liabilities arising out of the Company s adherence to customers specifications or designs or use of materials furnished, or directed to be used, by its customers.
785786_16_ITEM8_P113_S3	The Company does not believe its obligations under such indemnities are material.
785786_16_ITEM8_P113_S4	In the normal course of business, the Company also provides its customers a limited warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products manufactured by the Company.
785786_16_ITEM8_P113_S5	Such warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects in the Company s workmanship and meet mutually agreed-upon specifications for periods generally ranging from 12 months to 24 months.
785786_16_ITEM8_P113_S6	If a product fails to comply with the Company s limited warranty, the Company s obligation is generally limited to correcting, at its expense, any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product.
785786_16_ITEM8_P113_S7	The Company s warranty generally excludes defects resulting from faulty customer-supplied components, design defects or damage caused by any party or cause other than the Company.
785786_16_ITEM8_P113_S8	The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized and establishes additional reserves for specifically identified product issues.
785786_16_ITEM8_P113_S9	The primary factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the value and the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims.
785786_16_ITEM8_P113_S10	As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

785786_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") have reviewed and evaluated, with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date ).
785786_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on such evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, (a) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, and (b) in assuring that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
785786_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management of the Company, including its CEO and CFO, has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2016 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) (2013).
785786_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on its assessment and those criteria, management has reached the conclusion that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective at the reasonable assurance level.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2016 , as stated in its report included herein.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P3_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P3_S5	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P3_S6	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
785786_16_ITEM9A_P3_S7	Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have nonetheless reached the conclusion that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

785786_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Plexus has partnerships with over 140 customers in the Healthcare and Life Sciences, Industrial and Commercial, Communications, and Aerospace and Defense (formerly known as Defense, Security and Aerospace) market sectors.
785786_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	We leverage our expertise to understand the unique needs of our customers' markets and have aligned our processes to provide flexibility, create efficiency and deliver superior quality.
785786_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our customers have stringent quality, reliability and regulatory requirements, requiring exceptional production and supply chain agility.
785786_17_ITEM1_P4_S3	Their products require complex configuration management, direct order fulfillment (to end customers), global logistics management and aftermarket services.
785786_17_ITEM1_P4_S4	To service the complexities that our customers' products demand, we utilize our full suite of solutions offerings to support our customers products from concept to end of life.
785786_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	Plexus is passionate about being the leading EMS company in the world at servicing mid-to-low volume, higher complexity customer programs, characterized by unique flexibility, technology, quality and regulatory requirements.
785786_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	To deliver on our strategy, we align our operations, processes, workforce and financial metrics to create:
785786_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Execution driven by a collaborative, customer centric culture that continuously evaluates and optimizes our business processes to strive to create shareholder value.
785786_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	We operate flexible manufacturing facilities and design our processes to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations.
785786_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	One or more uniquely configured "focus factories," supported by a tailored supply chain and logistics solution, are designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness needed to support customer fulfillment requirements.
785786_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	We accomplish our go-to-market strategy through the four market sectors we serve.
785786_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	Each sector has a market sector vice president and a business development and customer management leader who together oversee and provide leadership to teams that include business development directors, customer directors or managers, supply chain and manufacturing subject matter experts, and market sector analysts.
785786_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	These teams maintain expertise related to each market sector and execute sector strategies aligned to that market s unique quality and regulatory requirements.
785786_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our market sector teams help define Plexus' strategy for growth with a particular emphasis on expanding the value-added solutions we offer customers.
785786_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our sales and marketing efforts focus on targeting new customers and expanding business with existing customers.
785786_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	We believe our ability to provide a full range of product realization services gives us a business advantage.
785786_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our financial model aligns with our business strategy.
785786_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; for fiscal 2017 our WACC was 10.5%.
785786_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe economic profit is a fundamental driver of shareholder value.
785786_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Plexus measures economic profit by taking the difference between ROIC and WACC and multiplying it by invested capital.
785786_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	By exercising discipline to generate a ROIC in excess of our WACC, with focus on economic profit, our goal is to ensure that we create value for our shareholders.
785786_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	For more information regarding ROIC and Economic Return, which are non-GAAP financial measures, refer to "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Results of Operations - Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Economic Return" in Part II, Item 7.
785786_17_ITEM1_P11_S4	For a reconciliation of ROIC and Economic Return to our financial statements that were prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP"), see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
785786_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, flexibility and fulfillment requirements, and complex regulatory requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs for us.
785786_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	The cost variance from our competitors is especially evident relative to those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics).
785786_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with many other technology pioneering start-ups or emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities.
785786_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	As a result of serving market sectors that rely on advanced electronics technology, our business is influenced by critical technological trends such as the level and rate of development of wired and wireless telecommunications infrastructure, communications data and data bandwidth growth, and internet usage.
785786_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	In addition to prime technology advancements, key government and policy trends impact our business, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s ("FDA") approval of new medical devices, defense procurement practices, and other government and regulatory processes.
785786_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	Plexus may benefit from increasing outsourcing trends.
785786_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	We provide most of our optimized solutions on a turnkey basis, and we procure some or all materials required for product assembly.
785786_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	We provide select services on a consignment basis, meaning the customer supplies the necessary materials and Plexus provides the labor and other services required for product assembly.
785786_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	In addition to manufacturing, turnkey service requires material procurement and warehousing and involves greater resource investments than consignment services.
785786_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Other than certain test equipment, manufacturing equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
785786_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Established in 1979 as a Wisconsin corporation, we have over 16,000 employees, including approximately 3,200 engineers and technologists dedicated to product development and design, test equipment development and design, and manufacturing process development and control, all of whom operate from 22 active facilities, totaling approximately 3.5 million square feet.
785786_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Plexus' facilities are strategically located to support the global supply chain, engineering, manufacturing, and Aftermarket Service needs of customers in our targeted market sectors.
785786_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Plexus maintains a website at www.plexus.com.
785786_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	As soon as is reasonably practical, after we electronically file or furnish all reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we provide online copies, free of charge.

785786_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	Using the same tools and processes throughout our eight Design Centers worldwide, we leverage the latest technology and state-of-the-art design automation methodologies to provide comprehensive new product development and value engineering solutions.
785786_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Supply Chain Solutions - Delivering an optimal supply chain solution is more than simply getting a product where it needs to be on time.
785786_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our supply chain experts engage in all of Plexus integrated solutions, working closely with our engineers to identify opportunities for supply chain optimization early in the design stage.
785786_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	At Plexus, we take pride in managing the full supply chain to minimize cost, mitigate risk and provide a flexible, scalable solution for our customers.

785786_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	We help our customers manage and extend the lifecycle of their products through an optimized level of service.
785786_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	With services such as depot repair, service parts logistics management, order management, distribution and warehousing, and recycling, we are committed to protecting the success of each customer's product.
785786_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Regulatory Requirements All Plexus manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to a baseline Quality Management System standard per ISO9001:2015.
785786_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	We have capabilities to assemble finished medical devices meeting FDA Quality Systems Regulation requirements and similar regulatory requirements in other countries.
785786_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have additional certifications and/or registrations held by certain facilities in the following regions:
785786_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Customers and Market Sectors Served Our customers range from large multinational companies to smaller emerging technology companies.
785786_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	During fiscal 2017, we served approximately 140 customers.
785786_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	We offer advanced design and production capabilities, allowing our customers to concentrate on their core competencies.
785786_17_ITEM1_P27_S3	Plexus helps accelerate our customers' time to market, reduce their investment in engineering and manufacturing capacity, and optimize total product cost.
785786_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	General Electric Company ("GE") accounted for 12.2% of our net sales during fiscal 2017 .
785786_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	GE, Micron Technology, Inc. ("Micron") and ARRIS Group, Inc. ("Arris") accounted for 11.1% , 10.4% , and 10.1% , respectively, of our net sales in fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	Arris and GE accounted for 12.6% and 10.6% respectively, of our net sales in fiscal 2015 .
785786_17_ITEM1_P28_S3	No other customers accounted for 10.0% or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years.
785786_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays, modifications and transitions.
785786_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers.
785786_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Customers' forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions.
785786_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations.
785786_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	significant negative impact on our financial results.
785786_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	In addition, as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector.
785786_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	Many of our large customers contract with us through multiple independent divisions, subsidiaries, production facilities or locations.
785786_17_ITEM1_P31_S3	We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others.
785786_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for the indicated fiscal years is shown in the following table:
785786_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	Although our current business development focus is based on our targeted market sectors, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources geographically (see Note 11 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments).
785786_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	Plexus offers a uniform array of services for customers in each market sector and we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources to particular market sectors, nor internally track our costs and resources per market sector.
785786_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Materials and Suppliers We typically purchase raw materials, including PCBs and electronic components, from manufacturers and distributors.
785786_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	Under certain circumstances, we will purchase components from brokers, customers or competitors.
785786_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	The key electronic components we purchase include: specialized components (such as application-specific integrated circuits), semiconductors, interconnect products, electronic subassemblies (including memory modules, power supply modules and cable and wire harnesses), inductors, resistors and capacitors.
785786_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	We also purchase non-electronic, typically custom engineered, components used in manufacturing and higher-level assembly.
785786_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	These components include molded/formed plastics, sheet metal fabrications, aluminum extrusions, robotics, motors, vision sensors, motion/actuation, fluidics, displays, die castings and various other hardware and fastener components.
785786_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	These components are sourced from both Plexus preferred suppliers and customer directed suppliers.
785786_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	Components range from standard to highly customized and vary widely in terms of market availability and price.
785786_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Component shortages and subsequent allocations by our suppliers are an inherent risk to the electronics industry, and have particularly been an issue for us and the industry from time to time.
785786_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	We discuss the causes of these shortages more fully in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein.
785786_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	We actively manage our business to minimize our exposure to material and component shortages.
785786_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Plexus' global supply chain management organization attempts to create strong supplier alliances and ensure a steady flow of components and products at competitive prices.
785786_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	We strive to achieve these goals through advanced supply chain solutions we develop in partnership with our customers, risk management tools and global expediting processes.
785786_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Plexus can often influence the selection of new product components when engaged to provide design and development solutions.
785786_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Competition Plexus operates in a highly competitive market, with a goal to be best-in-class at meeting the unique needs of our customers.
785786_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	We provide flexible solutions, timely order fulfillment, strong engineering, testing and production capabilities, and aftermarket services.
785786_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	A number of competitors may provide electronics manufacturing and engineering services similar to Plexus.
785786_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	Others may be more established in certain industry sectors, or have greater financial, manufacturing or marketing resources.
785786_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	Smaller competitors compete mainly in specific sectors and within limited geographic areas.
785786_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	Plexus also competes with in-house capabilities of current and potential customers.
785786_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	Plexus maintains awareness and knowledge of our competitors' capabilities, in order to remain highly competitive within the broad scope of the EMS industry.
785786_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	We own various service marks that we use in our business, which are registered in the trademark offices of the United States and other countries.
785786_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	Although we own certain patents, they are not currently material to our business.
785786_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	We do not have any material copyrights.
785786_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our core solutions for manufacturing facilities include a single-instance Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system, as well as Product Data Management and Advanced Planning and Scheduling systems, along with consistent solutions for warehouse management and shop floor execution, that support our global operations.
785786_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	This consistency augments our other management information systems, allowing us to standardize our ability to translate data from multiple production facilities into operational and financial information required by the business.
785786_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	The related software licenses are of a general commercial character on terms customary for these types of agreements.
785786_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Enhancing cybersecurity is a priority and we have several initiatives underway that are intended to further advance our security posture.
785786_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Environmental Compliance We are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to air emission standards and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process.
785786_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state and foreign environmental laws and do not anticipate any significant expenditures in maintaining our compliance; however, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
785786_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Social Responsibility Plexus is committed to social responsibility throughout our global business operations.
785786_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our commitment to social responsibility extends to human rights, labor practices, the environment, worker health and safety, fair operating practices and the Company s social impact in the communities where we operate.
785786_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	We consider a variety of standards for socially responsible practices, including local and federal legal requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate, the International Organization for Standardization s "Guidance on Social Responsibility" (ISO 26000) and standards established by the Responsible Business Alliance (the "RBA") (formerly known as the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition).
785786_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	Plexus is a member of the RBA.
785786_17_ITEM1_P47_S4	Information about our corporate social responsibility efforts is available on our website at www.plexus.com.
785786_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Employees We make a considerable effort to maintain a highly-qualified and engaged work force.
785786_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	We have been able to offer enhanced career opportunities to many of our employees.
785786_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our human resources department identifies career objectives and monitors specific skill development opportunities for employees with potential for advancement.
785786_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	We invest at all levels of the organization to ensure that employees are well trained and qualified for their positions.
785786_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	We have a policy of involvement and consultation with employees at every facility and strive for continuous improvement at all levels.
785786_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Given the quick response times required by our customers, we seek to maintain flexibility to scale our operations as necessary to maximize efficiency.
785786_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	To do so we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees.
785786_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	Approximately 230 and 850 of our employees are covered by union agreements in the United Kingdom and Mexico, respectively.
785786_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year, although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years.
785786_17_ITEM1_P49_S4	Our employees in China, Germany, Malaysia, Romania and the United States are not covered by union agreements.
785786_17_ITEM1_P49_S5	We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities, and we believe that our employee relationships are generally positive and stable.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions and world events.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose a major customer or if there are challenges in those market sectors, our net sales and operating results could decline significantly.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ten largest customers accounted for 55.5% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 , and 58.8% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 , there were one and three customers, respectively, that each represented 10.0% or more of our net sales.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our major customers may vary from period to period, and our major customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all, particularly given the volatile nature of certain programs.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We have experienced from time to time, and in the future may experience, significant customer or program disengagements, adverse changes in customer supply chain strategies and the end of life of significant programs.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Especially given our discrete number of customers, significant reductions in net sales to any of our major customers, the loss of major customers or our failure to make appropriate choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business and results of operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S7	In addition, we focus our sales efforts on customers in only a few market sectors.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Economic, business or regulatory conditions that affect the sector, or the Company s failure to choose appropriate sectors, can particularly impact Plexus.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S10	For instance, sales in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector are substantially affected by trends in the healthcare industry, such as government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the financial health of, and changes in the structure of, the U.S. healthcare sector generally, including as a result of developments related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Affordable Care Act").
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Further, potential reductions in U.S. government agency spending, including those due to budget cuts or other political developments or issues, could affect opportunities in all of our market sectors.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Any weakness in our customers' end markets could affect our business and results of operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S13	We rely on timely and regular payments from our customers; therefore, deterioration in the payment experience with or credit quality of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P2_S14	The inability or failure of our major customers to meet their obligations to us or their bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	From time to time, our customers, including formerly major customers, have been affected by merger and acquisition activity.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	While these transactions may present Plexus with opportunities to capture new business, they also create the risk that these customers will partially reduce their purchases or completely disengage from us as a result of transitioning such business to Plexus' competitors or deciding to manufacture the products internally.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Plexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and currency risks.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We have operations in many countries; operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate represent a majority of our net sales and operating income, with a particular concentration in Malaysia.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, a significant amount of our cash balances are currently held outside of the U.S., also with a particular concentration in Malaysia.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	These international aspects of our operations, which are likely to increase over time, subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results:
785786_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	potential disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access cash amounts held outside of the U.S.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	regulatory requirements and potential changes to those requirements.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We continue to monitor our risk associated with foreign currency and have entered into limited forward contracts to address this risk.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	As our international operations expand, our failure to appropriately address foreign currency transactions or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, developments affecting particular countries can adversely affect our ability to access cash or other assets held in such countries.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	A significant portion of our operations currently occurs in, and cash balances are held in, the APAC region, particularly in Malaysia.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The concentration of our operations, assets and profitability in that region exposes us to adverse developments, economic, political or otherwise, in those countries.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties, tariffs or taxes, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	For example, our facility in Mexico operates under the Mexican Maquiladora ("IMMEX") program.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our customers do not make long-term commitments and may cancel or change their production requirements.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Companies in our industry must respond quickly to the requirements of their customers in both design and production.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Customers also cancel requirements, change engineering or other service requirements, change production quantities, delay production, or revise or fail to meet their forecasts for a number of reasons that are beyond our control.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	In addition, customers may also fail to meet their commitments to us or our expectations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	The success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our working capital levels.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred from time to time and may continue to occur in the future.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P10_S9	In addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers requirements, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital (including inventory) management, facility and capacity requirements, personnel needs and other resource requirements.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	ability to accurately estimate their future requirements.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Because certain of our operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our operating results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Moreover, because our margins vary across customers and specific programs, a reduction in demand with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Rapid increases in customer requirements may stress personnel and other capacity resources.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We may not have sufficient resources at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program, which could result in a loss of business from such customers.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We have a complex business model, and our failure to properly manage or execute on that model, as well as an inability to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise, could adversely affect our operations, financial results and reputation.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business model focuses on products and services in the mid-to-low-volume, higher-complexity segment of our industry.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our customers products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility, in some cases necessitating optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solutions across an integrated global platform.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The products we manufacture are also typically complex, heavily regulated, and require complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In addition, we offer Aftermarket Services to our customers, which add to the complexity of our business model.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our business model requires a great degree of attention, flexibility and resources.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	These resources include working capital, management and technical personnel, and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse manufacturing, regulatory and service requirements for multiple programs of varying sizes simultaneously, including in multiple locations and geographies.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P13_S6	We also depend on securing and ramping new customers and programs and on transitioning production for new customers and programs, which creates added complexities related to managing the start-up risks of such projects, especially for companies that did not previously outsource such activities.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The complexity of our service model, which encompasses a broad range of services including conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and Aftermarket Services, often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations as well as commitments from us to our customers.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we fail to meet those obligations, it could result in claims against us or adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If we fail to effectively manage or execute our business model, we may lose customer confidence and our reputation may suffer.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	The Company s reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to maintain or expand business opportunities could be impaired and our financial results could suffer on a going-forward basis.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Many of the markets for our manufacturing, engineering, aftermarket and other services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process developments.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our internal processes are also subject to these factors.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The continued success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to:
785786_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will maintain or develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The emergence of new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, we may have to acquire new design, assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment, and the offering of new or additional services to our customers, may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements, or to perform to their expectations or standards, as well as our need to maintain our personnel and other resources during times of fluctuating demand, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our products and services are for end markets that require technologically advanced products.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Factors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve could adversely affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	the potential failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Even if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business relationships with them and our production for, or services offered to, them, can affect our production cycles, inventory management and results of operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs, or the provision of new services, could affect our operations and financial results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new programs or types of services (including expansion of our Aftermarket Services capabilities) for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to opportunities.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We must initially determine whether it would be in our interests from a business perspective to pursue a particular potential new customer, program or service, including evaluating whether the customer, program or service fits with our value proposition as well as its potential end-market success.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If we make the decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the anticipated costs, risks and rewards.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	The failure to make prudent engagement decisions or to establish appropriate terms of engagement could adversely affect our profitability and margins.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Also, there are inherent risks associated with the timing and ultimate realization of anticipated revenue from a new program or service; these factors can sometimes extend for a significant period.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Some new programs or services require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and competencies.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We may not meet customer expectations, which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver conforming product or services on a timely basis.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market acceptance, regulatory approvals or economic conditions.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute on a new program s or service s requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In recent years, our revenue growth has been more heavily dependent on ramping new program wins as compared to end-market growth of mature programs.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The management of resources in connection with the establishment of new or recent programs and customer relationships, as well as program transfers between facilities and geographies, and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross and operating margins and level of working capital.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life-cycle of new programs, which typically lack a track record of order volume and timing as well as production efficiencies in the early stages.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We typically manage multiple new programs at any given time; therefore, we are exposed to these factors in varying magnitudes.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, if any of these programs or customer relationships were terminated, our operating results could be negatively impacted, particularly in the short-term.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations and geographies.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We conduct these transfers on a regular basis to meet customer needs, seek long-term efficiencies or respond to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Although we try to minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between our facilities and geographies, there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P22_S7	While these factors tend to affect new, recent or transferred programs, they can also impact more mature, or maturing programs and customer relationships, especially programs where end-market demand can be somewhat volatile.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction to adjust to customers needs and market demands.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, as well as fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these decisions, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Expansion and consolidation, including the transfer of operations to other facilities or due to acquisitions, can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we are unable to effectively manage our recent or future expansions and consolidations, or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, we may expand our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Other risks of current or future expansions, acquisitions and consolidations include:
785786_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the expansion.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entail short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	When we make decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring charges, as we did in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In addition, to meet our customers needs, particularly when the production requirements of certain products are site-specific, or to achieve increased efficiencies, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Since customers needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S7	We may also encounter situations where our lack of a physical presence in certain locations may limit or foreclose opportunities.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S8	An inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, may adversely affect our business and reputation.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S9	As a global company with a complex business model, we are heavily dependent on our information systems to support our customers requirements and to successfully manage our business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S10	In particular, we are currently in the process of evaluating the potential replacement of our ERP system.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P26_S11	Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to system and data security, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our information systems, like those of other companies, are susceptible to malicious damage, intrusions and outages due to, among other events, viruses, cyber threats, industrial espionage (internal or external), hacking, break-ins and similar events, other breaches of security, natural disasters, power loss or telecommunications failures.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency, redundancy and recovery processes, as well as by purchasing insurance; however, these measures may not be sufficient.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Moreover, we are subject to increasing expectations and data security requirements from our customers, including those related to Federal Acquisition Regulation compliance.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Any operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of our or our customers financial, product or other confidential information, result in adverse regulatory or other legal actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Changes in tax laws, potential tax disputes, negative or unforeseen tax consequences or further developments affecting our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The Company s effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic mix of earnings across the jurisdictions where we operate.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Changes in tax laws or tax rates in those jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, as a result of actions by the current U.S. presidential administration or Brexit, could have a material impact on our operating results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The Company s effective tax rate may also be impacted by tax holidays and other various tax credits granted by local taxing authorities.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	All incentives, including a tax holiday granted to our Malaysian subsidiary, are subject to certain terms and conditions.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	While we expect to comply with these conditions, we would experience adverse tax consequences if we are found to not be in compliance or if the terms and conditions of the tax holiday are unfavorably altered by the local taxing authorities.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Due to inconsistencies among jurisdictions in the application of the arm s length standard, the Company s transfer pricing methods may be challenged and, if not upheld, could increase our income tax expense.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Risks associated with transfer pricing adjustments are further highlighted by the global initiative from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") called the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ("BEPS") project.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The BEPS project is challenging longstanding international tax norms regarding the taxation of profits from cross-border business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Given the scope of the Company's international operations and the fluid and uncertain nature of how the BEPS project might ultimately lead to future legislation, it is difficult to assess how any changes in tax laws would impact the Company s income tax expense.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income by jurisdiction.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in each of our jurisdictions may require the creation of an additional valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Brexit and related negative developments in the European Union could adversely affect our business and financial results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The United Kingdom s pending exit from the European Union has resulted in currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The terms of Brexit are not yet known.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Given the lack of comparable precedent, the implications of Brexit, or how such implications might affect the Company, remain unclear at this time.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Brexit could, among other impacts, disrupt trade and the movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other countries, disrupt the stability of the European Union generally, as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	These and other potential implications could adversely affect the Company s business and financial results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In the Brexit referendum, Scotland voted to remain in the European Union, while England and Wales voted to exit.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The disparity has renewed the Scottish independence movement.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Scottish leaders have publicly stated that a second independence referendum will not be held until after the terms of the Brexit are clear; however, plans may change.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Political issues and a potential breakup of the United Kingdom could create legal and economic uncertainty in the region and have a material adverse effect on the Company, which has operations in Scotland.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	We and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations and industry standards; a failure to comply with current and future regulations and standards could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	practices, the market sectors we support and many other facets of our operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	A failure to comply with such regulations or standards could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Particularly as a publicly-held company, we are subject to increasingly stringent laws, regulations and other requirements, including those affecting, among other areas, our accounting, internal controls, data protection and privacy, corporate governance practices, securities disclosures and reporting.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly aggressive in adopting and enforcing anti-corruption laws.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and China s Criminal Law and Anti-Unfair Competition Law, among others, apply to us and our operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Changes in healthcare laws and regulations may significantly affect the provision of both healthcare services and benefits in the U.S. and may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business, such as the demand for products in our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is subject to statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety, including Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulations and similar regulations in other countries.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Failure to comply with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of devices, or total or partial suspension of production.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We also design, manufacture and service products for certain industries, including certain applications where the U.S. government is the end customer, that face significant regulation by the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Commerce, Federal Aviation Authority, and other governmental agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries, and also under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, whenever we pursue business in new sectors and subsectors, or our customers pursue new technologies or markets, we need to navigate the potentially heavy regulatory and legislative burdens of such sectors, technologies or markets.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	For example, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, as well as the financial health of healthcare providers, and changes in how healthcare in the U.S. is structured, and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in this sector as well as impact our margins.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards, including many of the industry-specific regulations discussed above.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Our customers' failure to comply could affect their businesses, which in turn would affect our sales to them.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P44_S4	In addition, if our customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs for these customers and create inefficiencies in our business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P44_S5	A failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, and third party certification requirements or standards, including those related to social responsibility, could adversely affect our business and reputation.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P44_S6	In addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own or third party quality standards, business policies, commercial terms, or other social responsibility policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P44_S7	Such policies or standards may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third party organizations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P44_S8	Our compliance with these heightened and/or additional policies, standards and third party certification requirements, and managing a supply chain in accordance therewith, could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P44_S9	In addition, our adoption of these standards could adversely affect our cost competiveness, ability to provide customers with required service levels and ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P44_S10	In certain circumstances, to meet the requirements or standards of our customers we may be obligated to select certain suppliers or make other sourcing choices, and we may bear responsibility for adverse outcomes even if these matters are as the result of third party actions or outside of our control.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	There may be problems with the products we design, manufacture or service that could result in liability claims against us, reduced demand for our services and damage to our reputation.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The products that we design, manufacture or service may be subject to liability or claims in the event that defects are discovered or alleged.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We design, manufacture and service products to our customers specifications, many of which are highly complex, and produce products for industries, such as healthcare, aerospace and defense, that tend to have higher risk profiles.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the design, manufacturing or servicing of these products, including as a result of business continuity issues.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Whether or not we are responsible, problems in the products we manufacture, whether real or alleged, whether caused by faulty customer specifications, the design or manufacturing processes, servicing, or a component defect, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S4	If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S5	In addition, such problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S6	These potential claims may include damages for the recall of a product or injury to person or property.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S7	Even if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S8	While we seek to insure against many of these risks, we may not have practical recourse against certain suppliers, and insurance coverage or supplier warranties may be inadequate, not cost effective or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products or issues.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S9	We occasionally incur costs defending claims, and any such disputes could adversely affect our business relationships.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S10	Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S11	Our services and the products offered by our customers involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S12	In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S13	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S14	In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S15	We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S16	Infringement by our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and disrupt our production.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S17	Additionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S18	Such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products, and could affect our customer relationships more broadly.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P46_S19	Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and components upon which we rely.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Increased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We compete against numerous providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of designing, manufacturing and servicing products internally and may choose to design, manufacture or service products (including products or product types that we currently design, manufacture or service for them) themselves rather than outsource such activities.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Consolidations and other changes in our industry may result in a changing competitive landscape.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	be better positioned to compete on price for their services.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or otherwise become increasingly competitive.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or loss of market share.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Most of our services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts or orders.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	A customer s cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Engineering changes by a customer may result in obsolete materials or components.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory and require customers to reimburse us for these items, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or be able to collect on these obligations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Excess or obsolete inventory, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S4	These managed inventory programs result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S5	In addition, our inventory may be held at a customer s facility or warehouse, or elsewhere in a location outside of our control, which may increase the risk of loss.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S6	Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to customers' credit risks as well as the risk of potential customer default and the need to enforce those obligations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S7	We may experience raw material and component shortages and price fluctuations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S8	We generally do not have long-term supply agreements.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S9	We have experienced, from time-to-time currently experience, and in the future may experience, raw material and component shortages due to supplier capacity constraints or their failure to deliver.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S10	We have also experienced increased lead times to procure certain types of components.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P52_S11	Such constraints can also be caused by world events, such as government policies, terrorism, armed conflict, natural disasters, economic recession and other localized events.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used in the assembly process and, in some cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular raw material or component.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Such suppliers may encounter quality problems, labor disputes, financial difficulties or business continuity issues that could preclude them from delivering raw materials or components timely or at all.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Supply shortages and delays in deliveries of raw materials or components have in some cases resulted in delayed production of assemblies, which have increased our inventory levels and adversely affected our operating results in certain periods.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	An inability to obtain sufficient inventory on a timely basis could also harm relationships with our customers.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S4	In addition, raw materials and components that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Certain materials provided to us may be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S6	The need to obtain replacement materials and parts may negatively affect our manufacturing operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S7	The inadvertent use of any such parts or products may also give rise to liability claims.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S8	Raw material and component supply shortages and delays in deliveries can also result in increased pricing.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S9	While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in raw material or component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S10	Conversely, as a result of our pricing strategies and practices, raw material and component price reductions have contributed positively to our operating results in the past.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S11	Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S12	We depend on our workforce, including certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel or other personnel disruptions, including the inability to hire and retain sufficient personnel, may harm our business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S13	Our success depends in large part on the continued services of our key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, particularly highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of products.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S14	The competition for these individuals is significant, and the loss of key employees could harm our business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P53_S15	From time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, promotions, transitions, disability, death and other terminations of service that affect our executive officers and other key employees, including those that are unexpected.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	unplanned or not executed effectively, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, which could have an effect on our results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We also depend on good relationships with our workforce generally.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Any disruption in our relationships with our personnel, including as a result of potential union organizing activities, work actions or other labor issues, could substantially affect our operations and results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In addition, when we expand operations in either existing areas or new locations, including internationally, we need to attract and retain the services of sufficient qualified personnel to conduct those operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P54_S4	If we fail to retain and maintain sufficient qualified personnel, the operations at those locations, and consequently our financial results, could be adversely affected.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P54_S5	In new or existing facilities we may be subject to local labor practices or union activities, wage pressure and changing wage requirements, increasing healthcare costs, differing employment laws and regulations in various countries, local competition for employees, restrictions on labor mobility as well as high turnover, and other issues affecting our workforce, all of which could affect operations at particular locations, which also could have adverse effects on our operational results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	As noted above, our adoption of certain third-party standards could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Natural disasters, breaches of security and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis and floods.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P55_S3	For example, in late 2016, we suffered losses, primarily inventory-related, at our facility in Xiamen, China as a result of a typhoon.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	All facilities are subject to other natural or man-made disasters such as those related to weather events or global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism or war, breaches of security, theft or espionage, and failures of utilities.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If such an event was to occur, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event, with the impact of the event potentially magnified in areas where we have multiple facilities.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P56_S4	If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and thus negatively affect our relationships and financial results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P56_S6	Although we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to physical security, we remain at risk of unauthorized access to our facilities and the possible unauthorized use or theft of inventory, information or other physical assets.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P56_S7	If unauthorized persons gain physical access to our facilities, or our physical assets or information are stolen, damaged or used in an unauthorized manner (whether through outside theft or industrial espionage), we could be subject to, among other consequences, negative publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, loss of government contracts, litigation by affected parties or other future financial obligations related to the loss, misuse or theft of our or our customers' data, inventory or physical assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We may fail to secure or maintain necessary additional financing or capital.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We cannot be certain that our existing credit facilities will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	In addition, if we do not comply with the covenants under our credit agreement, our ability to borrow under that facility would be adversely affected.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P57_S3	In addition, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit agreement and receivables factoring programs, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations, either due to instability in the global financial markets or otherwise.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P57_S5	We have the potential to increase capacity under our revolving credit facility from $300 million to $500 million with the approval of the lenders.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P57_S6	In addition, we also have receivables factoring programs.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P57_S7	Many of our borrowings are at variable interest rates and therefore our interest expense is subject to increase if rates, including LIBOR, increase.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P57_S8	We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining new facilities, or through a combination of these methods.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	term product or other debt financing, although we can provide no assurances of the availability of such financing on attractive, or any, terms.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	An inability to refinance the Notes or to secure other debt financing could create significant liquidity issues for us.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P58_S3	If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders ownership interests; we may not be able to offer our securities on attractive or acceptable terms in the event of volatility or weakness in our stock price.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any current or future financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P58_S5	We may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions, as well as strategic arrangements, and may not successfully integrate acquired operations or recognize the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P58_S6	We have previously grown, in part, through acquisitions and strategic arrangements.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P58_S7	If we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions, including the acquisition of operations divested by our customers, or similar transactions, this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P58_S8	These risks include: Operating risks, such as:
785786_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	the loss of key employees of acquired businesses.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	the unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Changes in financial accounting standards may significantly affect our financial condition or the way we conduct business.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P61_S3	From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P61_S4	For example, in 2014 the FASB issued new guidance that impacts revenue recognition criteria and is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P61_S5	The Company has determined that the new standard will result in a change to the timing of revenue recognition for a significant portion of the Company's revenue stream, whereby revenue will be recognized "over time" as production occurs as opposed to at a "point in time" upon physical delivery.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P61_S6	The new standard could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements upon initial adoption, primarily as the Company recognizes an increase in contract assets for unbilled receivables with a corresponding reduction in finished goods and work-in-process inventory.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P61_S7	New controls will be needed to comply with such changes and we may fail to adequately implement the needed changes.
785786_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Other changes to accounting rules or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators may also have a material effect on our reported financial results, on the way we conduct business or on our internal controls.
785786_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	(1) The facilities in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, Penang, Malaysia and Xiamen, China include more than one building.
785786_17_ITEM4_P0_S0	Executive Officers See Part III, Item 10, "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance," of this Form 10-K for information regarding the Company's executive officers.
785786_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market Price per Share The Company s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the Nasdaq Global Select Market tier (symbol: PLXS).
785786_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	The price information below represents high and low sale prices of our common stock for each quarterly period during fiscal 2017 and 2016 :
785786_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total return on Plexus common stock with the Nasdaq Stock Market Index for U.S. Companies and the Nasdaq Stock Market Index for Electronic Components Companies, both of which include Plexus.
785786_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	The values on the graph show the relative performance of an investment of $100 made on September 28, 2012, in Plexus common stock and in each of the indices as of the last business day of the respective fiscal year.
785786_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	Shareholders of Record; Dividends As of November 13, 2017, we had 447 shareholders of record.
785786_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	We have not paid any cash dividends in the past.
785786_17_ITEM5_P2_S2	We currently anticipate that in the foreseeable future the majority of earnings will be retained to finance the development of our business and our authorized share repurchases.
785786_17_ITEM5_P2_S3	However, the Company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include additional share repurchases, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_17_ITEM5_P2_S4	See also Part II, Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources," for a discussion of the Company s intentions regarding dividends, and loan covenants which could restrict dividend payments.
785786_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table provides the specified information about the repurchases of shares by the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2017 :
785786_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	(1) On June 6, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150.0 million of its common stock.
785786_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) During fiscal 2016, the Company recorded $7.0 million in restructuring and other charges and $5.2 million in selling and administrative expenses, which are included in operating income.
785786_17_ITEM6_P0_S1	The $7.0 million was largely related to the Company's closure of its manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, and the partial closure of its Livingston, Scotland facility.
785786_17_ITEM6_P0_S2	The $5.2 million was related to accelerated share-based compensation expense recorded pursuant to the retirement agreement with the Company's former Chief Executive Officer.
785786_17_ITEM6_P0_S3	During fiscal 2015 and 2014 the Company recorded $1.7 million and $11.3 million, respectively, of restructuring and other charges, largely related to the Company's consolidation of its manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin, as well as its relocation of manufacturing operations from Juarez, Mexico to Guadalajara, Mexico.
785786_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	(2) The Company defines return on invested capital ("ROIC"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as tax-effected operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period.
785786_17_ITEM6_P1_S1	For a reconciliation of ROIC and Economic Return to our financial statements that were prepared in accordance with GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K. (3) Fiscal 2015 included 53 weeks.
785786_17_ITEM6_P1_S2	All other periods presented included 52 weeks.

785786_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Performance Summary.
785786_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the indicated fiscal years (dollars in millions, except per share data):
785786_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Fiscal 2017 net sales decreased $27.9 million, or 1.1% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	Fiscal 2016 net sales decreased $98.3 million, or 3.7%, as compared to fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net sales are analyzed by management by geographic segment, which reflects the Company's reportable segments, and by market sector.
785786_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Management measures operational performance and allocates resources on a geographic segment basis.
785786_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company s global business development strategy is based on our targeted market sectors.
785786_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	A discussion of net sales by reportable segment is presented below (in millions):
785786_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2017 in the AMER segment decreased $162.4 million , or 12.2% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	The reduction in net sales was driven by overall decreased customer end-market demand as well as decreases of $38.7 million from customer disengagements, $25.5 million due to manufacturing transfers to our APAC and EMEA segments, $24.0 million due to a customer's decision to manufacture product internally, $16.4 million from end-of-life products and $5.8 million that resulted from a program disengagement.
785786_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Partially offsetting these decreases were net sales increases of $36.6 million from the ramp of new programs for existing customers and $11.0 million from the ramp of production for new customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the AMER segment decreased $60.2 million, or 4.3%, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to decreased net sales of $75.8 million with a customer that resulted from decreased customer end-market demand for one of its products and $71.9 million due to two customer disengagements.
785786_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	The remaining reduction in net sales resulted from decreases of $17.4 million due to two customers bringing the manufacturing of three programs in house, $12.4 million due to pilot programs for three customers not transitioning into the production stage and $5.5 million due to a product disengagement, as well as net overall decrease in customer end-market demand.
785786_17_ITEM7_P10_S5	Partially offsetting these decreases were increased net sales of $187.3 million due to the ramp of production for a major customer, $59.8 million from the ramp of various new programs for several existing customers and $10.4 million due to the ramp of production for a new customer.
785786_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2017 in the APAC segment increased $117.4 million , or 10.1% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	The increase in net sales was primarily due to a $115.6 million increase due to the ramp of new programs for existing customers, net increased customer end-market demand and $21.4 million due to manufacturing transfers from our AMER segment.
785786_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	These increases were partially offset by decreases of $50.3 million due to a program disengagement, $38.6 million due to a customer s partial divestiture of one of its businesses and $14.6 million that resulted from an end-of-life product.
785786_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the APAC segment decreased $124.0 million, or 9.6%, as compared to fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	The reduction in net sales was primarily driven by a $90.7 million decrease in net sales due to a program disengagement.
785786_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Net sales also declined by $30.2 million due to two customers revising their business models as a result of decreased end-market demand and $7.0 million due to two customer disengagements.
785786_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	The remaining decrease in net sales was due to a net decrease in customer end-market demand.
785786_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	These decreases were partially offset by increased net sales of $76.5 million from the ramp of new programs for three existing customers and $19.4 million from the ramp of production for two new customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2017 in the EMEA segment increased $22.4 million , or 13.1% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to a $34.6 million increase due to the ramp of new programs for existing customers and $4.1 million due to manufacturing transfers from our AMER segment.
785786_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	Partially offsetting the increases was net decreased customer end-market demand and a $3.2 million decrease from end-of-life products.
785786_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the EMEA segment increased $30.1 million, or 21.5%, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to a $30.3 million increase in net sales due to the ramp of production of various new programs with several existing customers and $5.0 million from the ramp of production for a new customer.
785786_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	This was partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease as a result of a customer bringing the manufacturing of a program in house.
785786_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	The remaining decrease in net sales was due to a net decrease in customer end-market demand.
785786_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our net sales by market sector for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions):
785786_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2017 in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector increased $78.5 million , or 10.1% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase was primarily driven by increases in net sales of $74.4 million due to the ramp of new programs for existing customers, net increased customer end-market demand and $7.0 million from the ramp of production for new customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	Partially offsetting the increases were decreases in net sales of $24.8 million due to a customer's decision to manufacture product internally and $2.1 million due to end-of-life products.
785786_17_ITEM7_P16_S3	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector increased $30.1 million, or 4.0%, as compared to fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P16_S4	The increase was primarily due to a $41.9 million increase in net sales due to the ramp of various new programs for several existing customers, $26.4 million from the ramp of production for three new customers and a net increase in end-market demand.
785786_17_ITEM7_P16_S5	Partially offsetting the increases were decreases in net sales of $20.3 million due to three customers bringing the manufacturing process for four programs in house, $7.0 million due to two customer disengagements and $5.5 million due to a product disengagement.
785786_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2017 in the Industrial/Commercial sector increased $14.1 million , or 1.8% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase was primarily driven by increases in net sales of $84.8 million due to the ramp of new programs for existing customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the Industrial/Commercial sector increased $88.7 million, or 12.9%, as compared to fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase was primarily due to ramps of production for a major customer, which resulted in increased net sales of $221.2 million.
785786_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	Partially offsetting the increase were decreases of $42.7 million related to the disengagement of a customer, $30.2 million that resulted from two customers revising their business models as a result of decreased end-market demand and $12.4 million due to pilot programs for three customers not transitioning into the production stage.
785786_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	The remaining decrease was due to decreased customer end-market demand, due in part to the downturn in the oil and gas markets.
785786_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2017 in the Communications sector decreased $119.4 million , or 20.0% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	The reduction in net sales was primarily driven by a $52.4 million decrease in net sales due to a program disengagement, overall net decreased end-market demand, a $20.3 million decrease that resulted from end-of-life products and a $16.9 million decrease due to customer disengagements.
785786_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	Partially offsetting the decreases was an $18.9 million increase in net sales due to the ramp of production of new products for existing customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the Communications sector decreased $247.4 million, or 29.3%, as compared to fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	The reduction in net sales was primarily driven by a $90.7 million decrease in net sales due to a program disengagement, a $75.8 million decrease in net sales to another customer that resulted from decreased end-market demand for one of its products and a $29.2 million decrease due to the disengagement of a customer.
785786_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	Overall decreased end-market demand drove the remaining reduction in net sales during fiscal 2016.
785786_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	Partially offsetting the decreases was a $10.2 million increase in net sales due to the ramp of production of new programs for two existing customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2017 in the Aerospace/Defense sector decreased $1.1 million , or 0.3% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Partially offsetting the decreases were a $10.7 million increase in net sales that resulted from the ramp of production for new customers and a $10.2 million increase due to the ramp of production of new products for existing customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2016 in the Aerospace/Defense sector increased $30.3 million, or 8.1%, as compared to fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	The improvement was primarily attributable to increased net sales of $43.2 million that resulted from the ramp of production of new programs for several existing customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P21_S4	These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6.9 million due to program disengagements with two customers as well as a net decrease in customer end-market demand.
785786_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	As a percentage of consolidated net sales, net sales attributable to customers representing 10% or more of consolidated net sales as well as the percentage of net sales attributable to our ten largest customers for the indicated fiscal years were as follows:
785786_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Cost of sales for fiscal 2017 decreased $56.4 million , or 2.4% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, labor costs and overhead.
785786_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 89.0%, 90.0% and 90.0%, respectively, of the total cost of sales was variable in nature and fluctuated with sales volumes.
785786_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Of these amounts, approximately 88.0% of these costs in each period were related to material and component costs.
785786_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	As a result of primarily using a cost-plus markup pricing arrangement with our customers, changes in costs typically result in corresponding changes in price, which generally results in an immaterial impact on gross profit.
785786_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	As compared to fiscal 2016, the percentage decrease in cost of sales in fiscal 2017 was greater than the 1.1% decrease in net sales primarily due to a positive shift in customer mix, on-going supply chain productivity initiatives and decreased inventory obsolescence expenses, which resulted primarily from $2.9 million of inventory losses sustained from a typhoon that impacted the Company's manufacturing facilities in Xiamen, China during fiscal 2016.
785786_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	Cost of sales for fiscal 2016 decreased $86.1 million, or 3.6%, as compared to fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	As expected, the decrease in cost of sales of 3.6% as compared to fiscal 2015 was generally in line with the 3.7% decrease in net sales.
785786_17_ITEM7_P25_S4	Cost of sales decreased slightly less than the decrease in net sales primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in cost of sales that resulted from the Xiamen typhoon during fiscal 2016.
785786_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Gross profit for fiscal 2017 increased $28.5 million , or 12.5% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	Gross margin increased 120 basis points as compared to fiscal 2016.
785786_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	The primary driver of the increases in gross profit and gross margin as compared to fiscal 2016 was the larger percentage decrease in cost of sales as compared to the decrease in net sales, driven by the factors previously discussed.
785786_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	Gross profit for fiscal 2016 decreased $12.2 million, or 5.1%, as compared to fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	Gross margin decreased 10 basis points as compared to fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P26_S5	The primary driver of the decreases in gross profit and gross margin as compared to fiscal 2015 was the decrease in net sales and the $2.9 million increase in cost of sales due to the typhoon-related losses previously discussed.
785786_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Operating income for fiscal 2017 increased $30.5 million as compared to fiscal 2016 as a result of the increase in gross profit and a $7.0 million decrease in restructuring and other charges, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in selling and administrative expenses ("S A").
785786_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2016 related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California and the partial closure of our Livingston, Scotland facility.
785786_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	The increase in S A in fiscal 2017 resulted from a $3.5 million increase in variable compensation expense as a result of improved ROIC and $2.0 million of increased salary and wage-related expenses, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in share-based compensation expense.
785786_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	While the level of fiscal 2017 share-based compensation expense benefited from the non-recurrence of $5.2 million of accelerated share-based compensation expense related to the retirement of the Company's former President and Chief Executive Officer in fiscal 2016, that effect was partially offset by a non-recurring $2.1 million equity grant in 2017 in connection with his appointment as Executive Chairman of the Board.
785786_17_ITEM7_P27_S4	Operating margin increased to 5.1% in fiscal 2017 from 3.9% in fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P27_S5	Operating income for fiscal 2016 decreased $16.0 million as compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of the decrease in gross profit and a $5.3 million increase in restructuring and other charges, as discussed above, partially offset by a $1.5 million reduction in S A.
785786_17_ITEM7_P27_S6	The reduction in S A in fiscal 2016 resulted from a $6.4 million decrease in variable compensation expense, partially offset by a $5.4 million increase in share-based compensation expense primarily due to $5.2 million of accelerated share-based compensation expense due to the retirement of the Company's former President and Chief Executive Officer, as discussed above.
785786_17_ITEM7_P27_S7	Operating margin decreased to 3.9% in fiscal 2016 from 4.3% in fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	A discussion of operating income (loss) by reportable segment is presented below (in millions):
785786_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Operating income decreased $23.0 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 , primarily as a result of the decrease in net sales and increased variable labor costs to support new program ramps.
785786_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	The impact of the decrease in net sales was partially offset by a positive shift in customer mix due in part to decreased net sales to lower margin customers that resulted from two customer disengagements.
785786_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Operating income for fiscal 2016 decreased $3.7 million as compared to fiscal 2015, driven primarily by decreased net sales.
785786_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The impact of the net sales decrease was partially offset by a positive change in customer mix due in part to decreased net sales to lower margin customers that resulted from two customer disengagements.
785786_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Operating income increased $44.6 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 , primarily as a result of the increase in net sales, a positive shift in customer mix, supply chain productivity initiatives and decreased inventory obsolescence expenses, which resulted primarily from the $2.9 million of losses sustained in fiscal 2016 from the Xiamen typhoon discussed above.
785786_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Operating income decreased $4.7 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of the decrease in net sales and the effects of the Xiamen typhoon.
785786_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	The impact of the decrease in net sales was partially offset by a positive shift in net sales mix, partially due to a program disengagement, and a $4.7 million decrease in fixed manufacturing expenses due to cost saving initiatives.
785786_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Operating loss increased $2.5 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased labor costs to support new program ramps, partially offset by the impact of the increase in net sales.
785786_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Operating loss decreased $4.4 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the impact of the net sales increase, while fixed costs remained relatively flat.
785786_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Other expense for fiscal 2017 decreased $4.0 million as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	The decrease in other expense for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange volatility, which resulted in a foreign exchange gain of $2.3 million during fiscal 2017 as compared to a $1.7 million loss during fiscal 2016.
785786_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	This was partially offset by $2.2 million of expense related to the Company's accounts receivable securitization facility.
785786_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing Activities" for additional detail on the Company's accounts receivable securitization facility.
785786_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Other expense for fiscal 2016 increased $2.9 million as compared to fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase in other expense for fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of a $3.0 million increase in foreign exchange losses that resulted from foreign exchange volatility.
785786_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Income tax expense and effective annual income tax rates for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Income tax expense for fiscal 2017 was $9.8 million compared to $11.0 million for fiscal 2016 and $12.0 million for fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	The Company's annual effective tax rates vary from the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0% primarily as a result of the mix of earnings from U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and a tax holiday granted to a subsidiary located in the APAC region where the Company derives a significant portion of its earnings.
785786_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	related to incremental deductible expenses in a jurisdiction where we pay income taxes.
785786_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of the overall decrease in income before taxes in jurisdictions where the Company does not pay taxes.
785786_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	The Company has been granted a tax holiday for a foreign subsidiary operating in the APAC region.
785786_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	This tax holiday will expire on December 31, 2024, and is subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply.
785786_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the holiday resulted in tax reductions of approximately $37.5 million ($1.11 per basic share, $1.08 per diluted share), $27.1 million ($0.81 per basic share, $0.79 per diluted share), and $29.9 million ($0.89 per basic share, $0.87 per diluted share), respectively.
785786_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	See also Note 6, "Income Taxes," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company s tax rate.
785786_17_ITEM7_P39_S6	The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 is expected to be approximately 8.0% to 10.0%.
785786_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Net income for fiscal 2017 increased $35.7 million, or 46.7%, from fiscal 2016 to $112.1 million .
785786_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Net income increased primarily as a result of increased gross profit, decreased restructuring and other charges and decreased foreign exchange losses, partially offset by increases in S A, as discussed previously.
785786_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Net income for fiscal 2016 decreased $17.9 million, or 19.0%, from fiscal 2015 to $76.4 million.
785786_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	Net income decreased primarily as a result of decreased gross profit, increased restructuring and other charges and increased foreign exchange losses, partially offset by decreases in S A and income tax expense, as discussed previously.
785786_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Diluted earnings per share increased to $3.24 in fiscal 2017 from $2.24 in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of increased net income.
785786_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Diluted earnings per share decreased to $2.24 in fiscal 2016 from $2.74 in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of decreased net income.
785786_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	This was partially offset by the positive impact of fewer weighted average outstanding shares in fiscal 2016 due to our common stock repurchase program.
785786_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Economic Return.
785786_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	We use a financial model that is aligned with our business strategy and includes a ROIC goal of 500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), which we refer to as "Economic Return," and a 4.7% to 5.0% operating margin target.
785786_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	Our primary focus is on our Economic Return goal of 5.0%, which is designed to create shareholder value and generate sufficient cash to self-fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of 12.0%.
785786_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	ROIC and Economic Return are non-GAAP financial measures.
785786_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC and Economic Return, are used for internal management goals and decision making because such measures provide management and investors additional insight into financial performance.
785786_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	In particular, we provide ROIC and Economic Return because we believe they offer insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view ROIC and Economic Return as important measures in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital requirements.
785786_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	We also use a derivative measure of ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation, and certain compensation incentives are based on Economic Return performance.
785786_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	We define ROIC as tax-effected operating income before restructuring and other special items divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period for the fiscal year.
785786_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents.
785786_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way.
785786_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	ROIC and other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
785786_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually.
785786_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Our WACC was 10.5% for fiscal year 2017 and 11.0% for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders.
785786_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	ROIC was 16.2% , 13.8% , and 14.0% for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
785786_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	Fiscal 2017 ROIC of 16.2% reflects an Economic Return of 5.7%, based on our weighted average cost of capital of 10.5%.
785786_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	For a reconciliation of ROIC, Economic Return and adjusted operating income (tax effected) to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
785786_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Refer to the table below, which includes the calculation of ROIC and Economic Return (dollars in millions) for the indicated periods:
785786_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $569.3 million as of September 30, 2017 , as compared to $433.0 million as of October 1, 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	As of September 30, 2017 , 95.8% of our cash balance was held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries.
785786_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	While our intent is to permanently reinvest the funds held in these countries, we regularly review and evaluate that strategy, particularly as the percentage of our cash balance held outside the U.S. has increased.
785786_17_ITEM7_P51_S3	For example, during fiscal 2016, the Company repatriated $100.0 million of that fiscal year's foreign earnings from the APAC region to the U.S., which had no income statement impact due to U.S. net operating losses, the use of U.S. tax credits and the reversal of the related valuation allowance.
785786_17_ITEM7_P51_S4	The Company does not have a history of repatriating foreign earnings by way of a taxable dividend and considers the fiscal 2016 remittance to be an isolated occurrence.
785786_17_ITEM7_P51_S5	Without tax reform, the Company does not anticipate a similar repatriation in the foreseeable future.
785786_17_ITEM7_P51_S6	Currently, we believe that cash held in the U.S., together with cash available under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.
785786_17_ITEM7_P51_S7	See below for the Company's plans related to the potential refinancing of $175.0 million in principal amount of its 5.20% Senior Notes due on June 15, 2018 (the "Notes").
785786_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	The following table provides a summary of cash flows for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , excluding the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (in millions):
785786_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $171.7 million for fiscal 2017 , as compared to $127.7 million for fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	The improvement was primarily due to the increase in net income and a $13.9 million change in working capital.
785786_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Working capital cash flows improved as compared to the prior year primarily due to a $90.7 million increase in accounts receivable cash flows, which resulted primarily from increased factoring activity and an $18.1 million increase in customer deposit cash flows driven by significant deposits received from two customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	Partially offsetting these working capital cash flow improvements was an $85.3 million increase in cash used for inventory driven by increased inventory levels to support the ramp of new customer programs and an $11.7 million increase in cash used for other current and noncurrent assets cash flows resulting from increases in prepaid arrangements.
785786_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $127.7 million for fiscal 2016 , as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $76.6 million for fiscal 2015 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P54_S3	The improvement was primarily due to increased working capital requirements in fiscal 2015 due to the increase in net sales.
785786_17_ITEM7_P54_S4	This was partially offset by the larger increase in cash flows received for customer deposits in fiscal 2015 and the decrease in earnings in fiscal 2016.
785786_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	The following table provides a summary of cash cycle days for the periods indicated (in days):
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	We calculate days in accounts receivable as accounts receivable for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	We calculate days in inventory, accounts payable, and cash deposits as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	We calculate annualized cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits.
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	As of September 30, 2017 , annualized cash cycle days decreased one day compared to October 1, 2016 due to the following factors: Days in accounts receivable for the three months ended September 30, 2017 decreased eight days compared to the three months ended October 1, 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S4	The decrease is primarily attributable to a $121.2 million increase in accounts receivable sold under factoring programs, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable that resulted from a shift in customer mix and an increase in payment terms with certain customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S5	Days in inventory for the three months ended September 30, 2017 increased twelve days compared to the three months ended October 1, 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S6	The increase is primarily driven by an increase in inventory levels as a result of experiencing longer lead times for certain components for new programs and to support new program ramps.
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S7	In order to maintain a high level of customer service, we are procuring components earlier, which has led to the increase in inventory.
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S8	Days in accounts payable for the three months ended September 30, 2017 increased two days compared to the three months ended October 1, 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S9	The increase is primarily driven by increased purchasing activity to support new program ramps.
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S10	Days in cash deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2017 increased three days compared to the three months ended October 1, 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P56_S11	The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in customer deposits primarily due to deposits received from two customers during the three months ended September 30, 2017 as we actively seek deposits to cover higher inventory balances.
785786_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	We define free cash flow ("FCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash flow provided by operations less capital expenditures.
785786_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	FCF was $133.2 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $96.6 million for fiscal 2016 , an increase of $36.6 million .
785786_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	Non-GAAP financial measures, including FCF, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight to investors into ongoing financial performance.
785786_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	In particular, we provide FCF because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions.
785786_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	We view FCF as an important financial metric as it demonstrates our ability to generate cash and can allow us to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.
785786_17_ITEM7_P57_S5	FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
785786_17_ITEM7_P57_S6	A reconciliation of FCF to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP follows (in millions):
785786_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Cash flows used in investing activities were $37.8 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $26.5 million for fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	proceeds received from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily related to the sale of our former engineering facility in Neenah, Wisconsin in fiscal 2016.
785786_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	Cash flows used in investing activities were $26.5 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $34.7 million for fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	The reduction was due to a $4.0 million decrease in capital expenditures and the $4.2 million increase in proceeds received from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
785786_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	We utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal 2017 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	We currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 will be approximately $80 million to $90 million.
785786_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Cash flows provided by financing activities were $1.3 million for fiscal 2017 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $21.3 million for fiscal 2016 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase was primarily attributable to a net $32.8 million increase in borrowings, which was partially offset by a $4.1 million increase in cash used to repurchase our shares under the stock repurchase program described below, a $3.5 million increase in payments related to tax withholding for share-based compensation and a $3.0 million decrease in proceeds received from stock option exercises.
785786_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Cash flows used in financing activities were $21.3 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $26.2 million for fiscal 2015.
785786_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	The decrease was primarily attributable to the $5.0 million increase in proceeds received from increased stock option exercise activity during fiscal 2016.
785786_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	On June 6, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a multi-year stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150.0 million of its common stock beginning in fiscal 2017, subject to market conditions and other considerations.
785786_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	During fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased 655,470 shares under this program for $34.1 million , at an average price of $52.08 per share.
785786_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	On August 20, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock during fiscal 2016.
785786_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	During fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased 760,903 shares under this program for $30.0 million , at an average price of $39.43 per share.
785786_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	All shares repurchased under the repurchase programs were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Company has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with a $300.0 million maximum commitment that expires on July 5, 2021.
785786_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	The Credit Facility may be further increased to $500.0 million, generally by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, subject to certain customary conditions.
785786_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company s option, at a eurocurrency or base rate plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin based on the Company s then-current leverage ratio (as defined in the related Credit Agreement).
785786_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	As of September 30, 2017 , the borrowing rate under the Credit Agreement was LIBOR plus 1.125% (or 2.358% ).
785786_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	The Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused revolver credit commitment based on the Company's leverage ratio; the fee was 0.175% as of September 30, 2017 .
785786_17_ITEM7_P67_S3	During fiscal 2017, the highest daily borrowing was $151.0 million ; the average daily borrowings were $106.7 million .
785786_17_ITEM7_P67_S4	The Company borrowed $331.0 million and repaid $298.0 million of revolving borrowings under the Credit Facility during fiscal 2017.
785786_17_ITEM7_P67_S5	As of the end of fiscal 2017, $108.0 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility.
785786_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	The financial covenants (as defined under the Credit Agreement) require, among other covenants, that the Company maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
785786_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	As of September 30, 2017 , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit Agreement.
785786_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	In fiscal 2011, Plexus issued $175.0 million in principal amount of the Notes.
785786_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	The related Note Purchase Agreement contains certain financial covenants, which include a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth test, all as defined in the agreement.
785786_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	As of September 30, 2017 , the Company was in compliance with all such covenants relating to the Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement.
785786_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	Assuming no U.S. tax reform within the next year, our intention is to refinance the Notes with a similar long-term product, although we can provide no assurances of the availability of such financing on attractive, or any, terms.
785786_17_ITEM7_P70_S3	If we are unable to refinance the Notes, the Company believes that it would still be able to fulfill its financial obligation with available cash and other sources of liquidity.
785786_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the repurchase of shares provided that no event of default (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases.
785786_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	currently anticipate paying them in the future.
785786_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	However, we evaluate from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases above those already authorized, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company has a Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement (the "BTMU RPA") with The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., New York Branch (the "BTMU Purchaser").
785786_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Pursuant to the BTMU RPA, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (each, a "Seller") may sell to the BTMU Purchaser accounts receivable owed to such Sellers by specified customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	In exchange, the BTMU Purchaser pays a purchase price for each purchased receivable equal to the net face value of the receivable less an agreed-upon discount.
785786_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	The BTMU RPA represents a non-committed facility.
785786_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	The BTMU Purchaser pays an agreed-upon servicing fee to each Seller with respect to each purchased receivable sold by such Seller, consistent with common market practices.
785786_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	The BTMU RPA contains representations, warranties, covenants, and termination events that are customary for factoring transactions of this type.
785786_17_ITEM7_P74_S3	The BTMU RPA was amended on October 19, 2017 to increase the maximum facility amount from $120.0 million to $160.0 million .
785786_17_ITEM7_P74_S4	The BTMU RPA is subject to expiration on October 3, 2018, but will be automatically extended each year unless any party gives no less than 10 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended.
785786_17_ITEM7_P74_S5	The Company also has a Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement (the "HSBC RPA") with HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Xiamen branch (the "HSBC Purchaser").
785786_17_ITEM7_P74_S6	Pursuant to the HSBC RPA, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (each, an "HSBC Seller") may sell to the HSBC Purchaser up to an aggregate of $60.0 million in accounts receivable owed to such HSBC Sellers by specified customers.
785786_17_ITEM7_P74_S7	The terms of the HSBC RPA are generally consistent with the terms of the BTMU RPA discussed above.
785786_17_ITEM7_P74_S8	The Company sold $418.0 million , $65.6 million and $93.1 million of trade accounts receivable under these programs during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in exchange for cash proceeds of $415.8 million , $65.0 million and $92.4 million , respectively.
785786_17_ITEM7_P74_S9	In all cases, the sale discount was recorded within "Miscellaneous expense" in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period of the sale.
785786_17_ITEM7_P74_S10	For further information regarding the receivable sale programs, see Note 14, "Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents, potential borrowings under the Credit Facility, potential refinancing of the Notes and our leasing capabilities, should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months, including the repayment of the Notes.
785786_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing.
785786_17_ITEM7_P75_S2	Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources.
785786_17_ITEM7_P75_S3	However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms.
785786_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS Our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings.
785786_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	Information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 30, 2017 (dollars in millions):
785786_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	1) Includes $175.0 million in principal amount of Notes and amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.
785786_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	As of September 30, 2017 , the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was $108.0 million .
785786_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	The amounts listed above include interest; see Note 4, "Debt, Capital Lease Obligations and Other Financing," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_17_ITEM7_P77_S3	2) As of September 30, 2017 , capital lease and other financing obligations consists of capital lease payments and interest as well as the non-cash financing obligation related to the failed sale-leaseback in Guadalajara, Mexico; see Note 4, "Debt, Capital Lease Obligations and Other Financing," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_17_ITEM7_P77_S4	3) As of September 30, 2017 , purchase obligations consist primarily of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business.
785786_17_ITEM7_P77_S5	4) As of September 30, 2017 , other long-term obligations on the balance sheet included deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers, as well as other key employees, and an asset retirement obligation.
785786_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	We have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately $3.1 million , as of September 30, 2017 , related to unrecognized income tax benefits.
785786_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	The Company cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to these obligations.
785786_17_ITEM7_P78_S2	5) As of September 30, 2017 , other long-term obligations not on the balance sheet consisted of guarantees and a commitment for salary continuation and certain benefits in the event employment of one executive officer of the Company is terminated without cause.
785786_17_ITEM7_P78_S3	Excluded from the amounts disclosed are certain bonus and incentive compensation amounts, which would be paid on a prorated basis in the year of termination.
785786_17_ITEM7_P78_S4	6) Includes future minimum lease payments under the 10-year base lease agreement in Guadalajara as well as two 5-year renewal options; see Note 4, "Debt, Capital Lease Obligations and Other Financing," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	During fiscal 2017 , there were no material changes to these policies.
785786_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Our more critical accounting estimates are described below: Revenue Recognition: Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.
785786_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling.
785786_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as program costs are incurred by utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
785786_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes that would become payable upon the repatriation of undistributed earnings.
785786_17_ITEM7_P85_S3	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_17_ITEM7_P85_S4	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.
785786_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Share-Based Compensation: Generally accepted accounting principles require all grants of share-based compensation to employees to be measured at fair value and expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value stock options and the Monte Carlo valuation model to value performance stock units.
785786_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	See Note 9, "Benefit Plans," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
785786_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
785786_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment.
785786_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond the Company s control.
785786_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory.
785786_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	Any actions taken by the Company s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.
785786_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups may not be recoverable through estimated future undiscounted cash flows.
785786_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a charge against current operations.
785786_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_17_ITEM7_P90_S3	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.
785786_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Accounts receivable are reflected at net realizable value based on anticipated losses due to potentially uncollectible balances.
785786_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	Anticipated losses are based on management s analysis of historical losses and changes in customers credit status.
785786_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	Warranties: The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized and establishes additional reserves for specifically identified product issues.
785786_17_ITEM7_P91_S3	The primary factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the value and the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims.
785786_17_ITEM7_P91_S4	As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
785786_17_ITEM7_P91_S5	See Note 12, "Guarantees," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
785786_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the indicated fiscal years were as follows:
785786_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Based on the Company s overall currency exposure, as of September 30, 2017 , a 10.0% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have financial instruments, including cash equivalents and debt, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	To achieve this, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of highly rated securities, money market funds and certificates of deposit, and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As of September 30, 2017 , our only material interest rate risk is associated with our Credit Facility.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company s option, at a eurocurrency or base rate plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin based on the Company s then-current leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
785786_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As of September 30, 2017 , the borrowing rate under the Credit Agreement was LIBOR plus 1.125% (or 2.358% ).
785786_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Borrowings under the Note Purchase Agreement are based on a fixed interest rate, thus mitigating much of our interest rate risk.
785786_17_ITEM7A_P5_S3	Based on the Company s overall interest rate exposure, as of September 30, 2017 , a 10.0% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
785786_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	NOTE: All other financial statement schedules are omitted because they are not applicable or the required information is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto.
785786_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Plexus Corp.:
785786_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
785786_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
785786_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
785786_17_ITEM8_P2_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
785786_17_ITEM8_P2_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
785786_17_ITEM8_P2_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
785786_17_ITEM8_P2_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
785786_17_ITEM8_P2_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
785786_17_ITEM8_P2_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
785786_17_ITEM8_P2_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
785786_17_ITEM8_P2_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
785786_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
785786_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
785786_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
785786_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
785786_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
785786_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
785786_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
785786_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
785786_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business: Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together "Plexus" or the "Company,") participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ("EMS") industry.
785786_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	Plexus has been partnering with companies to transform concepts into branded products and deliver them to customers in the Healthcare/Life Sciences, Industrial/Commercial, Communications and Aerospace/Defense market sectors.
785786_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	Plexus is headquartered in Neenah, Wisconsin and has operations in the Americas ("AMER"), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia-Pacific ("APAC") regions.
785786_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation Principles and Basis of Presentation:
785786_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include the accounts of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries.
785786_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
785786_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
785786_17_ITEM8_P12_S3	The Company s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
785786_17_ITEM8_P12_S4	The Company also uses a "4-4-5" weekly accounting system for the interim periods in each quarter.
785786_17_ITEM8_P12_S5	Each quarter, therefore, ends on a Saturday at the end of the 4-4-5 period.
785786_17_ITEM8_P12_S6	Periodically, an additional week must be added to the fiscal year to re-align with the Saturday closest to September 30.
785786_17_ITEM8_P12_S7	Fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 each included 52 weeks; fiscal 2015 included 53 weeks.
785786_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash: Cash equivalents include short-term highly liquid investments and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy described below.
785786_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	Restricted cash represents cash received from customers to settle invoices sold under accounts receivable purchase agreements that is contractually required to be set aside.
785786_17_ITEM8_P13_S2	The restrictions will lapse when the cash is remitted to the purchaser of the receivables.
785786_17_ITEM8_P13_S3	Restricted cash is also classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy described below.
785786_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	As of September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 , cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands):
785786_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
785786_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
785786_17_ITEM8_P15_S2	Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment.
785786_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond the Company s control.
785786_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory.
785786_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	Any actions taken by the Company s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.
785786_17_ITEM8_P16_S3	In certain instances, in accordance with contractual terms, the Company receives customer deposits to offset obsolete and excess inventory risks.
785786_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
785786_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Certain facilities and equipment held under capital leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities.
785786_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	Amortization of assets held under capital leases is included in depreciation expense (see Note 3, "Property, Plant and Equipment") and the financing component of the lease payments is classified as interest expense.
785786_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
785786_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company capitalizes significant costs incurred in the acquisition or development of software for internal use.
785786_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	This includes costs of the software, consulting services and compensation costs for employees directly involved in developing internal use computer software.
785786_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups may not be recoverable through estimated future undiscounted cash flows.
785786_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a charge against current operations.
785786_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_17_ITEM8_P20_S3	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.
785786_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.
785786_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling.
785786_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as program costs are incurred by utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	Net sales from engineering design and development services were less than 5.0% of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
785786_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
785786_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_17_ITEM8_P26_S2	The Company does not currently provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes that would become payable upon the repatriation of undistributed earnings.
785786_17_ITEM8_P26_S3	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_17_ITEM8_P26_S4	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.
785786_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Foreign Currency Translation Transactions: The Company translates assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the relevant balance sheet date and net sales, expenses and cash flows at the average exchange rates during the respective periods.
785786_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	Exchange gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions were $2.3 million , $(1.7) million , and $1.3 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
785786_17_ITEM8_P27_S2	These amounts include the amount of gain (loss) recognized in income during each fiscal year due to forward currency exchange contracts entered into to hedge recognized assets or liabilities ("non-designated hedges") the Company entered into during each respective year.
785786_17_ITEM8_P27_S3	Refer to Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," for further details on derivatives.
785786_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	Derivatives: All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheets at fair value.
785786_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company periodically enters into forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
785786_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a non-designated hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a "cash flow" hedge).
785786_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
785786_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	Changes in the fair value of non-designated derivatives are recorded in earnings as are the gains or losses related to the hedged asset or liability.
785786_17_ITEM8_P30_S3	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" within shareholders equity, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
785786_17_ITEM8_P30_S4	Certain forward currency exchange contracts are treated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, $2.4 million , $9.0 million and $(11.2) million was recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
785786_17_ITEM8_P30_S5	See Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," for further information.
785786_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Grants from Government Authorities: Grants from governments are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant funds will be received and the Company will comply with all attached conditions to the grant.
785786_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are recorded as an offset to the carrying value of the related assets at the time of capitalization.
785786_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	Government grants relating to other costs incurred are recognized as an offset to those related costs, for which the grants are intended to compensate for, at the time they are recognized.
785786_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Earnings Per Share: The computation of basic earnings per common share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and net income.
785786_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	The computation of diluted earnings per common share reflects additional dilution from share-based awards, excluding any with an antidilutive effect.
785786_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	See Note 7, "Earnings Per Share," for further information.
785786_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Share-based Compensation: The Company measures all grants of share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, at fair value and expenses them in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	See Note 9, "Benefit Plans," for further information.
785786_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss): The Company follows the established standards for reporting comprehensive income (loss), which is defined as the changes in equity of an enterprise except those resulting from shareholder transactions.
785786_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	Accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of the following as of September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 (in thousands):
785786_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
785786_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
785786_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The Company holds financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, certain deferred compensation assets held under trust arrangements, accounts payable, debt, derivatives, and capital lease obligations.
785786_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and capital lease obligations as reported in the consolidated financial statements approximate fair value.
785786_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	Derivatives and certain deferred compensation assets held under trust arrangements are recorded at fair value.
785786_17_ITEM8_P36_S3	Accounts receivable are reflected at net realizable value based on anticipated losses due to potentially uncollectible balances.
785786_17_ITEM8_P36_S4	Anticipated losses are based on management s analysis of historical losses and changes in customers credit status.
785786_17_ITEM8_P36_S5	The fair value of the Company s debt was $284.5 million and $251.4 million as of September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 , respectively.
785786_17_ITEM8_P36_S6	The carrying value of the Company's debt was $283.0 million and $250.0 million as of September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 , respectively.
785786_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company uses quoted market prices when available or discounted cash flows to calculate fair value.
785786_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described below.
785786_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
785786_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
785786_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.
785786_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	The input levels are: Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
785786_17_ITEM8_P40_S2	Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
785786_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.
785786_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Business and Credit Concentrations: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and derivative instruments, specifically related to counterparties.
785786_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	In accordance with the Company s investment policy, the Company s cash, cash equivalents and derivative instruments were placed with recognized financial institutions.
785786_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	The Company s investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure in any one issue and the maturity date of the investment securities that typically comprise investment grade short-term debt instruments.
785786_17_ITEM8_P42_S3	Concentrations of credit risk in accounts receivable resulting from sales to major customers are discussed in Note 11, "Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers".
785786_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company, at times, requires cash deposits for services performed.
785786_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	The Company also closely monitors extensions of credit.
785786_17_ITEM8_P43_S2	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-18 to address the classifications and presentation of changes in restricted cash in the statement of cash flows.
785786_17_ITEM8_P43_S3	The Company adopted this guidance retrospectively during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and, as a result, the Company has included restricted cash within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows; such amounts were not material.
785786_17_ITEM8_P43_S4	The retrospective adoption did not impact the prior period Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows since there was no restricted cash during any of the prior periods presented.
785786_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Amounts included in restricted cash represent cash received from customers to settle invoices sold under the trade accounts receivable sale programs that is contractually required to be set aside.
785786_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	The restrictions will lapse when the cash is remitted to the purchaser of the receivables.
785786_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.
785786_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid-in capital pools.
785786_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting.
785786_17_ITEM8_P45_S3	In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis.
785786_17_ITEM8_P45_S4	The Company adopted this guidance prospectively during the first fiscal quarter of 2017.
785786_17_ITEM8_P45_S5	Upon adoption, the Company recognized no net impact to its fiscal 2017 opening retained earnings balance as an incremental $4.9 million net operating loss carryforward related to tax deductions in excess of compensation expense for stock options was fully offset by an increase to the valuation allowance.
785786_17_ITEM8_P45_S6	The adoption did not have any other material impacts and will not materially impact the Company's future financial statements as long as the Company remains in a valuation allowance in the jurisdictions in which share-based compensation awards and options vest and are exercised, respectively.
785786_17_ITEM8_P45_S7	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted:
785786_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 related to the accounting for hedging activities.
785786_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	The pronouncement expands and refines hedge accounting, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
785786_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and early adoption is permitted.
785786_17_ITEM8_P46_S3	The Company is finalizing its assessment of the impact of the guidance, but does not believe it will have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16 related to the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
785786_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	The new standard eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs.
785786_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is permitted.
785786_17_ITEM8_P47_S3	This guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
785786_17_ITEM8_P47_S4	The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments, which clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows.
785786_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	The new standard addresses certain issues where diversity in practice was identified.
785786_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	It also amends existing guidance, which is principles based and often requires judgment to determine the appropriate classification of cash flows as operating, investing or financing activities and clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.
785786_17_ITEM8_P48_S3	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and will generally require retrospective adoption.
785786_17_ITEM8_P48_S4	The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
785786_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets but record expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting.
785786_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases.
785786_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
785786_17_ITEM8_P49_S3	The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of the new standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements and the timing of adoption.
785786_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize revenue relating to contracts with customers that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services ("Topic 606").
785786_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	Topic 606 also requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers and is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
785786_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company developed a comprehensive project plan that includes a global cross-functional team of representatives to conduct an assessment of Topic 606 and its potential impacts on the Company.
785786_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	The project plan includes analyzing the standard s impact on the Company s various revenue streams, comparing its historical accounting policies and practices to the requirements of the new standard, and identifying potential differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to its contracts.
785786_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Company is in the process of identifying and implementing appropriate changes to its current accounting policies, business processes, systems and controls to support revenue recognition and disclosures under Topic 606.
785786_17_ITEM8_P51_S3	As of September 30, 2017 , the Company has determined that the new standard will result in a change to the timing of revenue recognition for a significant portion of the Company's revenue, whereby revenue will be recognized "over time," as products are produced, as opposed to at a "point in time" upon physical delivery.
785786_17_ITEM8_P51_S4	The new standard could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements upon initial adoption, primarily as the Company recognizes an increase in contract assets for unbilled receivables with a corresponding reduction in finished goods and work-in-process inventory.
785786_17_ITEM8_P51_S5	The Company presently expects to adopt Topic 606 at the beginning of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective approach.
785786_17_ITEM8_P51_S6	The Company believes that no other recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, or apply to its operations.

785786_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in income before taxes in lower tax-rate jurisdictions and a tax benefit related to incremental deductible expenses in a jurisdiction where the Company pays income taxes.
785786_17_ITEM8_P76_S2	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is higher than that of fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of the overall decrease in income before taxes in jurisdictions where the Company does not pay taxes.

785786_17_ITEM8_P79_S5	The Company does not provide for taxes that would be payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted because the Company considers these earnings to be permanently reinvested.

785786_17_ITEM8_P90_S3	The expected options and SARs lives represent the period of time that the options and SARs granted are expected to be outstanding and were based on historical experience.
785786_17_ITEM8_P90_S4	The weighted average fair value per share of options and SARs granted for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were $15.66 , $12.82 and $14.55 , respectively.

785786_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company uses the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of PSUs at the date of grant.
785786_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	Vesting of all PSUs granted in fiscal 2016 and prior years is based on the relative TSR of Plexus stock as compared to the TSR of companies in the Russell 3000 Index during a three -year performance period.
785786_17_ITEM8_P94_S2	Beginning in fiscal 2017, 50% of the PSUs will vest based on relative TSR performance, with the other 50% vesting based on a three-point annual average of the Company's absolute economic return, each during a three -year performance period.
785786_17_ITEM8_P94_S3	The vesting and payout of awards will range between 0% and 200% of the shares granted based upon performance on the metrics during the performance period.
785786_17_ITEM8_P94_S4	Payout at target, 100% of the shares granted, will occur if the TSR of Plexus stock is at the 50 th percentile of companies in the Russell 3000 Index during the performance period and if a 2.5% average economic return is achieved over the three -year performance period.
785786_17_ITEM8_P94_S5	The number of shares that may be issued pursuant to PSUs ranges from zero to 0.4 million .

785786_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	The Company uses an internal management reporting system, which provides important financial data to evaluate performance and allocate the Company s resources on a regional basis.
785786_17_ITEM8_P100_S2	Net sales for the segments are attributed to the region in which the product is manufactured or the service is performed.
785786_17_ITEM8_P100_S3	The services provided, manufacturing processes used, class of customers serviced and order fulfillment processes used are similar and generally interchangeable across the segments.
785786_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	A segment s performance is evaluated based upon its operating income (loss).
785786_17_ITEM8_P101_S1	A segment s operating income (loss) includes its net sales less cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses, but excludes corporate and other expenses.
785786_17_ITEM8_P101_S2	Corporate and other expenses primarily represent corporate selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring and other charges, if any.
785786_17_ITEM8_P101_S3	Losses incurred from a typhoon that impacted the APAC segment in fiscal 2016 are excluded from the segment results and included within corporate and other expenses.
785786_17_ITEM8_P101_S4	These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments.
785786_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	Inter-segment transactions are generally recorded at amounts that approximate arm s length transactions.
785786_17_ITEM8_P102_S1	The accounting policies for the segments are the same as for the Company taken as a whole.

785786_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	Guarantees The Company offers certain indemnifications under its customer manufacturing agreements.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	In the normal course of business, the Company may from time to time be obligated to indemnify its customers or its customers customers against damages or liabilities arising out of the Company s negligence, misconduct, breach of contract, or infringement of third party intellectual property rights.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S1	Certain agreements have extended broader indemnification, and while most agreements have contractual limits, some do not.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S2	However, the Company generally does not provide for such indemnities and seeks indemnification from its customers for damages or liabilities arising out of the Company s adherence to customers specifications or designs or use of materials furnished, or directed to be used, by its customers.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S3	The Company does not believe its obligations under such indemnities are material.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S4	In the normal course of business, the Company also provides its customers a limited warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products manufactured by the Company.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S5	Such warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects in the Company s workmanship and meet mutually agreed-upon specifications for periods generally ranging from 12 months to 24 months.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S6	The Company s obligation is generally limited to correcting, at its expense, any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S7	The Company s warranty generally excludes defects resulting from faulty customer-supplied components, design defects or damage caused by any party or cause other than the Company.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S8	The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized and establishes additional reserves for specifically identified product issues.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S9	The primary factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the value and the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S10	As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
785786_17_ITEM8_P111_S11	Below is a table summarizing the activity related to the Company s limited warranty liability for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

785786_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	The BTMU Purchaser pays an agreed-upon servicing fee to each Seller with respect to each purchased receivable sold by such Seller, consistent with common market practices.
785786_17_ITEM8_P115_S2	The BTMU RPA contains representations, warranties, covenants, and termination events that are customary for factoring transactions of this type.
785786_17_ITEM8_P115_S3	The BTMU RPA was amended on October 19, 2017 to increase the maximum facility amount from $120.0 million to $160.0 million .

785786_17_ITEM8_P116_S1	Transfers of receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
785786_17_ITEM8_P116_S2	Proceeds from the transfer reflect the face value of the receivables less a discount.
785786_17_ITEM8_P116_S3	The sale discount is recorded within "Miscellaneous expense" in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period of the sale.

785786_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	(1) The annual total amounts may not equal the sum of the quarterly amounts due to rounding.
785786_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	Earnings per share is computed independently for each quarter.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") have reviewed and evaluated, with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this report.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on such evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of September 30, 2017 , the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, (a) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, and (b) in assuring that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
785786_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management of the Company, including its CEO and CFO, has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 , based on the criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") (2013).
785786_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on its assessment and those criteria, management has reached the conclusion that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 , as stated in its report included herein.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P3_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P3_S5	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P3_S6	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
785786_17_ITEM9A_P3_S7	Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have nonetheless reached the conclusion that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

785786_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	Plexus delivers comprehensive end-to-end solutions in the Americas ("AMER"), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia-Pacific ("APAC") regions for our customers.
785786_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	We specialize in working in industries with highly complex products and demanding regulatory requirements.
785786_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	Plexus has partnerships with approximately 140 customers in the Healthcare/Life Sciences, Industrial/Commercial, Communications, and Aerospace/Defense market sectors.
785786_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	We leverage our expertise to understand the unique needs of our customers' markets and have aligned our processes to provide flexibility, create efficiency and deliver superior quality.
785786_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our customers have stringent quality, reliability and regulatory requirements, requiring exceptional production and supply chain agility.
785786_18_ITEM1_P4_S3	Their products require complex configuration management, direct order fulfillment (to end customers), global logistics management and aftermarket services.
785786_18_ITEM1_P4_S4	To service the complexities that our customers' products demand, we utilize our full suite of solution offerings to support our customers products from concept to end of life.
785786_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	Plexus is passionate about being the leading EMS company in the world at servicing mid-to-low volume, higher complexity customer programs, characterized by unique flexibility, technology, quality and regulatory requirements.
785786_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	To deliver on our strategy, we align our operations, processes, workforce and financial metrics to create:
785786_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	Execution driven by a collaborative, customer centric culture that continuously evaluates and optimizes our business processes to strive to create shareholder value.
785786_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	We operate flexible manufacturing facilities and design our processes to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations.
785786_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	One or more uniquely configured "focus factories," supported by a tailored supply chain and logistics solution, are designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness needed to support customer fulfillment requirements.
785786_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	We accomplish our go-to-market strategy through the four market sectors we serve.
785786_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	Each sector has a market sector vice president and a business development and customer management leader who together oversee and provide leadership to teams that include business development directors, customer directors or managers, supply chain and manufacturing subject matter experts, and market sector analysts.
785786_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	These teams maintain expertise related to each market sector and execute sector strategies aligned to that market s unique quality and regulatory requirements.
785786_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our market sector teams help define Plexus' strategy for growth with a particular emphasis on expanding the value-added solutions we offer customers.
785786_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our sales and marketing efforts focus on targeting new customers and expanding business with existing customers.
785786_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	We believe our ability to provide a full range of product realization services gives us a business advantage.
785786_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our financial model aligns with our business strategy.
785786_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; for fiscal 2018, our WACC was 9.5%.
785786_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe economic profit is a fundamental driver of shareholder value.
785786_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	Plexus measures economic profit by taking the difference between ROIC and WACC and multiplying it by invested capital.
785786_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	By exercising discipline to generate a ROIC in excess of our WACC, with focus on economic profit, our goal is to ensure that we create value for our shareholders.
785786_18_ITEM1_P11_S3	For more information regarding ROIC and Economic Return, which are non-GAAP financial measures, refer to "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Results of Operations - Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Economic Return" in Part II, Item 7.
785786_18_ITEM1_P11_S4	For a reconciliation of ROIC and Economic Return to our financial statements that were prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP"), see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
785786_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, flexibility and fulfillment requirements, and complex regulatory requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs for us.
785786_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	The cost variance from our competitors is especially evident relative to those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics).
785786_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with many other technology pioneering start-ups or emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities.
785786_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	As a result of serving market sectors that rely on advanced electronics technology, our business is influenced by critical technological trends such as the level and rate of development of wired and wireless telecommunications infrastructure, communications data and data bandwidth growth, and internet usage.
785786_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	In addition to prime technology advancements, key government and policy trends impact our business, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s ("FDA") approval of new medical devices, defense procurement practices, and other government and regulatory processes.
785786_18_ITEM1_P13_S3	Plexus may benefit from increasing outsourcing trends.
785786_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	We provide most of our optimized solutions on a turnkey basis, and we procure some or all materials required for product assembly.
785786_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	We provide select services on a consignment basis, meaning the customer supplies the necessary materials and Plexus provides the labor and other services required for product assembly.
785786_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	In addition to manufacturing, turnkey service requires material procurement and warehousing and involves greater resource investments than consignment services.
785786_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Other than certain test equipment, manufacturing equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
785786_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Established in 1979 as a Wisconsin corporation, we have over 18,000 employees, including over 3,500 engineers and technologists dedicated to product development and design, test equipment development and design, and manufacturing process development and control, all of whom operate from 23 active facilities, totaling approximately 3.5 million square feet.
785786_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Plexus' facilities are strategically located to support the global supply chain, engineering, manufacturing, and Aftermarket Service needs of customers in our targeted market sectors.
785786_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Plexus maintains a website at www.plexus.com.
785786_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	As soon as is reasonably practical, after we electronically file or furnish all reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we provide online copies, free of charge.

785786_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Supply Chain Solutions - Delivering an optimal supply chain solution is more than simply getting a product where it needs to be on time.
785786_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our supply chain experts engage in all of Plexus integrated solutions, working closely with our engineers to identify opportunities for supply chain optimization early in the design stage.
785786_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	At Plexus, we take pride in managing the full supply chain to minimize cost, mitigate risk and provide a flexible, scalable solution for our customers.

785786_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Regulatory Requirements All Plexus manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to a baseline Quality Management System standard per ISO9001:2015.
785786_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	We have capabilities to assemble finished medical devices meeting FDA Quality Systems Regulation requirements and similar regulatory requirements in other countries.
785786_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have additional certifications and/or registrations held by certain facilities in the following regions:

785786_18_ITEM1_P28_S3	No other customers accounted for 10.0% or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years.
785786_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays, modifications and transitions.
785786_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers.
785786_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	Customers' forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions.
785786_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations.
785786_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	The loss of any major customer could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.
785786_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector.
785786_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	Many of our large customers contract with us through multiple independent divisions, subsidiaries, production facilities or locations.
785786_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others.
785786_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for the indicated fiscal years is shown in the following table:
785786_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Although our current business development focus is based on our targeted market sectors, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources geographically (see Note 11 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments).
785786_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	Plexus offers a uniform array of services for customers in each market sector and we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources to particular market sectors, nor internally track our costs and resources per market sector.
785786_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	Materials and Suppliers We typically purchase raw materials, including PCBs and electronic components, from manufacturers and distributors.
785786_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	Under certain circumstances, we will purchase components from brokers, customers or competitors.
785786_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	The key electronic components we purchase include: specialized components (such as application-specific integrated circuits), semiconductors, interconnect products, electronic subassemblies (including memory modules, power supply modules and cable and wire harnesses), inductors, resistors and capacitors.
785786_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	We also purchase non-electronic, typically custom engineered, components used in manufacturing and higher-level assembly.

785786_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	These components are sourced from both Plexus preferred suppliers and customer directed suppliers.
785786_18_ITEM1_P35_S3	Components range from standard to highly customized and vary widely in terms of market availability and price.
785786_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Component shortages and subsequent allocations by our suppliers are an inherent risk to the electronics industry, and have particularly been an issue for us and the industry from time to time, including during fiscal 2018.
785786_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	We discuss the causes of these shortages more fully in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein.
785786_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	We actively manage our business to minimize our exposure to material and component shortages.
785786_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Plexus' global supply chain management organization attempts to create strong supplier alliances and ensure a steady flow of components and products at competitive prices.
785786_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	We strive to achieve these goals through advanced supply chain solutions we develop in partnership with our customers, risk management tools and global expediting processes.
785786_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Plexus can often influence the selection of new product components when engaged to provide design and development solutions.
785786_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Competition Plexus operates in a highly competitive market, with a goal to be best-in-class at meeting the unique needs of our customers.
785786_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	We provide flexible solutions, timely order fulfillment, strong engineering, testing and production capabilities, and aftermarket services.
785786_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	A number of competitors may provide electronics manufacturing and engineering services similar to Plexus.
785786_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	Others may be more established in certain industry sectors, or have greater financial, manufacturing or marketing resources.
785786_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	Smaller competitors compete mainly in specific sectors and within limited geographic areas.
785786_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	Plexus also competes with in-house capabilities of current and potential customers.
785786_18_ITEM1_P41_S4	Plexus maintains awareness and knowledge of our competitors' capabilities, in order to remain highly competitive within the broad scope of the EMS industry.
785786_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	Although we own certain patents, they are not currently material to our business.
785786_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	We do not have any material copyrights.
785786_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our core solutions for manufacturing facilities include a single-instance Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system, as well as Product Data Management and Advanced Planning and Scheduling systems, along with consistent solutions for warehouse management and shop floor execution, that support our global operations.
785786_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	This consistency augments our other management information systems, allowing us to standardize our ability to translate data from multiple production facilities into operational and financial information required by the business.
785786_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	The related software licenses are of a general commercial character on terms customary for these types of agreements.
785786_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Enhancing cybersecurity continues to be a priority and we have several initiatives underway that are intended to further advance our security posture.
785786_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Environmental Compliance We are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to air emission standards and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process.
785786_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state and foreign environmental laws and do not anticipate any significant expenditures in maintaining our compliance; however, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
785786_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Social Responsibility Plexus is committed to social responsibility throughout our global business operations.
785786_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our commitment to social responsibility extends to human rights, labor practices, the environment, worker health and safety, fair operating practices and the Company s social impact in the communities where we operate.
785786_18_ITEM1_P47_S2	We consider a variety of standards for socially responsible practices, including local and federal legal requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate, the International Organization for Standardization s "Guidance on Social Responsibility" (ISO 26000) and standards established by the Responsible Business Alliance (the "RBA").
785786_18_ITEM1_P47_S3	Plexus is a member of the RBA.
785786_18_ITEM1_P47_S4	Information about our corporate social responsibility efforts is available on our website at www.plexus.com.
785786_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Employees We make a considerable effort to maintain a highly-qualified and engaged work force.
785786_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	We have been able to offer enhanced career opportunities to many of our employees.
785786_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our human resources department identifies career objectives and monitors specific skill development opportunities for employees with potential for advancement.
785786_18_ITEM1_P48_S3	We invest at all levels of the organization to ensure that employees are well trained and qualified for their positions.
785786_18_ITEM1_P48_S4	We have a policy of involvement and consultation with employees at every facility and strive for continuous improvement at all levels.
785786_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Given the quick response times required by our customers, we seek to maintain flexibility to scale our operations as necessary to maximize efficiency.
785786_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	To do so we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees.
785786_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	Approximately 300 and 1,000 of our employees are covered by union agreements in the United Kingdom and Mexico, respectively.
785786_18_ITEM1_P49_S3	These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year, although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years.
785786_18_ITEM1_P49_S4	Our employees in China, Germany, Malaysia, Romania and the United States are not covered by union agreements.
785786_18_ITEM1_P49_S5	We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities, and we believe that our employee relationships are generally positive and stable.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions and world events.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose a major customer or if there are challenges in those market sectors, our net sales and operating results could decline significantly.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Net sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our ten largest customers accounted for 57.2% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 , and 55.5% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 .
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	During each of the fiscal years ended September 29, 2018 , and September 30, 2017 , there was one customer that represented 10.0% or more of our net sales.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our major customers may vary from period to period, and our major customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all, particularly given the volatile nature of certain programs.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In any given period, a higher portion of our sales may be concentrated with customers or projects with relatively lower margins, which could adversely affect our results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S6	We have experienced from time to time, and in the future may experience, significant disengagements with customers or of programs, adverse changes in customer supply chain strategies and the end of life of significant programs.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Especially given our discrete number of customers, significant reductions in net sales to any of our major customers, the loss of major customers or our failure to make appropriate choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business and results of operations in such periods.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S8	In addition, we focus our sales efforts on customers in only a few market sectors.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Economic, business or regulatory conditions that affect the sector, or the Company s failure to choose appropriate sectors, can particularly impact Plexus.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S11	For instance, sales in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector are substantially affected by trends in the healthcare industry, such as government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the financial health of, and changes in the structure of, the U.S. healthcare sector generally.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Additionally, the semiconductor industry has historically been subject to significant cyclicality and volatility.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Further, potential reductions in U.S. government agency spending, including those due to budget cuts or other political developments or issues, could affect opportunities in all of our market sectors.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Any weakness in our customers' end markets could affect our business and results of operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We rely on timely and regular payments from our customers; therefore, deterioration in the payment experience with or credit quality of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	The inability or failure of our major customers to meet their obligations to us or their bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	From time to time, our customers, including formerly major customers, have been affected by merger, acquisition, divestiture and spin-off activity.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P3_S5	While these transactions may present Plexus with opportunities to capture new business, they also create the risk that these customers will partially reduce their purchases or completely disengage from us as a result of transitioning such business to Plexus' competitors or deciding to manufacture the products internally.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Plexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and currency risks.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We have operations in many countries; operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate represent a majority of our net sales and operating income, with a particular concentration in Malaysia.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, although we repatriated $431.2 million of cash during fiscal 2018, a significant amount of our cash balances remain held outside of the U.S., with a particular concentration in Malaysia and China.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	These international aspects of our operations, which are likely to increase over time, subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results:
785786_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	potential disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access cash amounts held outside of the U.S.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	regulatory requirements and potential changes to those requirements.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We continue to monitor our risk associated with foreign currency and have entered into limited forward contracts to address this risk.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	As our international operations continue to expand, our failure to appropriately address foreign currency transactions or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, developments affecting particular countries can adversely affect our ability to access cash or other assets held in such countries.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	A significant portion of our operations currently occurs in the APAC region, particularly in Malaysia.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Malaysian government is currently undergoing a period of transition, and while this may present new opportunities, changes in the Malaysian political climate could be challenging.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The concentration of our operations, assets and profitability in that region exposes us to adverse developments, economic, political or otherwise, in those countries.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to trade wars, changes in duties, tariffs or taxes, currency exchange rate fluctuations, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	NAFTA, including as a result of the USMCA or otherwise, could adversely affect our operations in Mexico.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Also, our current facilities in Mexico operate under the Mexican Maquiladora ("IMMEX") program.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Additionally, increasing tariffs and other trade protection measures between the U.S. and China may affect the cost of our products originating in China as well as the demand for our products manufactured in China in the event our customers reduce operations in China as a result of such tariffs or trade protection measures.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	These actions could also affect the cost and/or availability of components that we procure from suppliers in China.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The United Kingdom's pending exit from the European Union has resulted in currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The terms of Brexit are not yet known.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Given the lack of comparable precedent, the implications of Brexit, or how such implications might affect the Company (which also has operations in Scotland), remain unclear at this time.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Brexit could, among other impacts, disrupt trade and the movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other countries, disrupt the stability of the European Union generally, as well as create legal, political and global economic uncertainty.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These and other potential implications could adversely affect the Company's business and financial results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our customers do not make long-term commitments and may cancel or change their production requirements.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Companies in our industry must respond quickly to the requirements of their customers in both design and production.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Customers also cancel requirements, change engineering or other service requirements, change production quantities, delay production, or revise or fail to meet their forecasts for a number of reasons that are beyond our control, and customer expectations can change requiring us to take on additional commitments or risks.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	In addition, customers may also fail to meet their commitments to us or our expectations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	The success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our working capital levels.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred from time to time and may continue to occur in the future.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S8	In addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers' requirements, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital (including inventory) management, facility and capacity requirements, personnel needs and other resource requirements.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S9	The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate their future requirements.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Because certain of our operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our operating results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S11	The need for us to correctly anticipate component needs is amplified in times of shortages.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S12	The current environment of tight component supply can increase the difficulties and cost of anticipating changing demand.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Moreover, because our margins vary across customers and specific programs, a reduction in demand with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S14	Rapid increases in customer requirements may stress personnel and other capacity resources.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S15	We may not have sufficient resources, including personnel and components, at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program, which could result in a loss of business from such customers.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P14_S16	We have a complex business model, and our failure to properly manage or execute on that model, as well as an inability to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise, could adversely affect our operations, financial results and reputation.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our business model focuses on products and services in the mid-to-low-volume, higher-complexity segment of our industry.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our customers' products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility, in some cases necessitating optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing and supply chain solutions across an integrated global platform.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The products we manufacture are also typically complex, heavily regulated, and require complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, we offer Aftermarket Services to our customers, which add to the complexity of our business model.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our business model requires a great degree of attention, flexibility and resources.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P15_S5	These resources include working capital, management and technical personnel, and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse manufacturing, regulatory and service requirements for multiple programs of varying sizes simultaneously, including in multiple locations and geographies.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	production for new customers and programs, which creates added complexities related to managing the start-up risks of such projects, especially for companies that did not previously outsource such activities.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The complexity of our service model, which encompasses a broad range of services including conceptualization, design, commercialization, manufacturing, fulfillment and Aftermarket Services, often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations as well as commitments from us to our customers.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, customer expectations have also increased in recent years with respect to certain capabilities and commitments.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If we fail to meet those obligations or are otherwise are unable to execute on our commitments, it could result in claims against us or adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we fail to effectively manage or execute our business model, we may lose customer confidence and our reputation may suffer.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The Company's reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to maintain or expand business opportunities could be impaired and our financial results could suffer on a going-forward basis.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Many of the markets for our manufacturing, engineering, aftermarket and other services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process developments.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our internal processes are also subject to these factors.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The continued success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to:
785786_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will maintain or develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The emergence of new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, we may have to acquire new design, assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive, as well as offer new or additional services, all of which may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers' changing technological needs and requirements, or to perform to their expectations or standards, as well as our need to maintain our personnel and other resources during times of fluctuating demand, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We experience raw material and component shortages and price fluctuations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	We generally do not have long-term supply agreements.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P20_S6	We experience, and in the future will likely continue to experience, raw material and component shortages due to supplier capacity constraints, or their failure to deliver.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P20_S7	We also experience increased lead times to procure certain types of components.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Such constraints can also be caused by world events, such as government policies, tariffs, trade wars and trade protection measures, terrorism, armed conflict, natural disasters, economic recession, increased demand due to economic growth, preferential allocations and other localized events.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used in the assembly process and, in some cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular raw material or component.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Such suppliers may encounter quality problems, labor disputes, financial difficulties or business continuity issues that could preclude them from delivering raw materials or components timely or at all.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Supply shortages and delays in deliveries of raw materials or components have in some cases resulted in delayed production of assemblies, which have increased our inventory levels and adversely affected our operating results in certain periods.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Additionally, a delay in obtaining a particular component may result in other components for the related project being held for longer periods of time, increasing working capital and risking inventory obsolescence.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	An inability to obtain sufficient inventory on a timely basis could also harm relationships with our customers.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In addition, raw materials and components that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Certain materials provided to us may be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P21_S7	The need to obtain replacement materials and parts may negatively affect our manufacturing operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P21_S8	The inadvertent use of any such parts or products may also give rise to liability claims.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Raw material and component supply shortages and delays in deliveries, along with other factors such as tariffs and trade disputes, can also result in increased pricing.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in raw material or component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Conversely, as a result of our pricing strategies and practices, raw material and component price reductions have contributed positively to our operating results in the past.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Our services involve other inventory risk.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Most of our services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts or orders.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P22_S7	A customer's cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Engineering changes by a customer may result in obsolete materials or components.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory and require customers to reimburse us for these items, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or be able to collect on these obligations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In addition to increasing inventory in certain instances to support new program ramps, we may also increase inventory if we experience component shortages or longer lead times for certain components in order to maintain a high level of customer service.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In such situations, we may procure components earlier, which has led to an increase in inventory in the short term and may lead to increased, excess, or obsolete inventory in the future.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Excess or obsolete inventory, the need to acquire increasing amounts of inventory due to shortages, customer demand or otherwise, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	These managed inventory programs result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P23_S7	In addition, our inventory may be held at a customer's facility or warehouse, or elsewhere in a location outside of our control, which may increase the risk of loss.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to customers' credit risks as well as the risk of potential customer default and the need to enforce those obligations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our products and services are for end markets that require technologically advanced products.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Factors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve could adversely affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	the potential failure of our customers' products to gain widespread commercial acceptance.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Even if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business relationships with them and our production for, or services offered to, them, or to our supply chain for related components, can affect our production cycles, inventory management and results of operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs, or the provision of new services, could affect our operations and financial results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Our engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new programs or types of services for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to opportunities.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We must initially determine whether it would be in our interests from a business perspective to pursue a particular potential new customer, program or service, including evaluating whether the customer, program or service fits with our value proposition as well as its potential end-market success.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	If we make the decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the anticipated costs, risks and rewards.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P26_S5	The failure to make prudent engagement decisions or to establish appropriate terms of engagement could adversely affect our profitability and margins.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Also, there are inherent risks associated with the timing and ultimate realization of anticipated revenue from a new program or service; these factors can sometimes extend for a significant period.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Some new programs or services require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and competencies.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver conforming product or services on a timely basis.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market acceptance, regulatory approvals or economic conditions.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute on a new program's or service's requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	In recent years, ramping new program wins has been a key contributor to our revenue growth.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	The management of resources in connection with the establishment of new or recent programs and customer relationships, as well as program transfers between facilities and geographies, and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross and operating margins and level of working capital.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S6	These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life-cycle of new programs, which typically lack a track record of order volume and timing as well as production efficiencies in the early stages.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S7	We typically manage multiple new programs at any given time; therefore, we are exposed to these factors in varying magnitudes.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S8	In addition, if any of these programs or customer relationships were delayed or terminated, our operating results could be negatively impacted, particularly in the short-term.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S9	The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations and geographies.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S10	We conduct these transfers on a regular basis to meet customer needs, seek long-term efficiencies or respond to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S11	We may also be required to transfer projects between facilities due to trade measures impacting particular countries such as China.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S12	Although we try to recover costs from our customers and minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between our facilities and geographies, we may not be successful and there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P28_S13	While these factors tend to affect new, recent or transferred programs, they can also impact more mature, or maturing programs and customer relationships, especially programs where end-market demand can be somewhat volatile.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet changing customer and market requirements.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, as well as fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these decisions, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Expansion and consolidation, including the transfer of operations to new or other facilities or due to acquisitions, can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For example, we are in the process of bringing online additional facilities in Guadalajara, Mexico and Penang, Malaysia, which are expected to be completed in fiscal 2019 and are intended to supplement our footprint in those particular regions.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	If we are unable to effectively manage our recent or future expansions and consolidations, or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, we may expand our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Other risks of current or future expansions, acquisitions and consolidations include:
785786_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the expansion.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entail short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S4	When we make decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring costs.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S5	In addition, to meet our customers' needs, particularly when the production requirements of certain products are site-specific, to achieve increased efficiencies, or to address other factors affecting specific locations, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Since customers needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S7	We may also encounter situations where our lack of a physical presence in certain locations may limit or foreclose opportunities.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S8	An inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, may adversely affect our business and reputation.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S9	As a global company with a complex business model, we are heavily dependent on our information systems to support our customers' requirements and to successfully manage our business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S10	In particular, we are currently in the process of upgrading our most significant ERP system and evaluating the replacement of other systems.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P33_S11	Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to system and data security, cybersecurity, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our information systems, like those of other companies, are susceptible to malicious damage, intrusions and outages due to, among other events, viruses, cyber threats, industrial espionage (internal or external), hacking, break-ins and similar events, other breaches of security, natural disasters, power loss or telecommunications failures.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency, redundancy and recovery processes, as well as by purchasing insurance; however, these measures may not be sufficient.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Moreover, we are subject to increasing expectations and data security requirements from our customers, including those related to Federal Acquisition Regulation compliance.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Any operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of our or our customers' financial, product or other confidential information, result in adverse regulatory or other legal actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S. and elsewhere.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P34_S6	For example, the European Union recently adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR").
785786_18_ITEM1A_P34_S7	The GDPR imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws and regulations can be costly; any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P34_S9	Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, fines and penalties, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P34_S10	Changes in tax laws, potential tax disputes, negative or unforeseen tax consequences or further developments affecting our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Company's effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic mix of earnings across the jurisdictions where we operate.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Changes in tax laws or tax rates in those jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, as a result of actions by the U.S. (including additional guidance and interpretations related to U.S. Tax Reform) or other countries or Brexit, could continue to have a material impact on our operating results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Among other things, the Company will be affected by the global intangible low-taxed income provisions added by U.S. Tax Reform and related new tax legislation, interpretations and guidance.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P35_S3	The Company's effective tax rate may also be impacted by tax holidays and other various tax credits granted by local taxing authorities.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P35_S4	In addition, the implementation of U.S. Tax Reform has required the use of estimates, which may be refined in future periods.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	While we expect to comply with these conditions, we would experience adverse tax consequences if we are found to not be in compliance or if the terms and conditions of the tax holiday are unfavorably altered by the local taxing authorities.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Due to inconsistencies among jurisdictions in the application of the arm's length standard, the Company s transfer pricing methods may be challenged and, if not upheld, could increase our income tax expense.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Risks associated with transfer pricing adjustments are further highlighted by the global initiative from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") called the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ("BEPS") project.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The BEPS project is challenging longstanding international tax norms regarding the taxation of profits from cross-border business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Given the scope of the Company's international operations and the fluid and uncertain nature of how the BEPS project might ultimately lead to future legislation, it is difficult to assess how any changes in tax laws would impact the Company's income tax expense.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income by jurisdiction.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in each of our jurisdictions may require the creation of an additional valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations and industry standards; a failure to comply with current and future regulations and standards could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We are subject to extensive government regulation and industry standards (as well as customer-specific standards) relating to the products we design, manufacture and service as well as how we conduct our business, including regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support and many other facets of our operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	A failure to comply with such regulations or standards could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Particularly as a publicly-held company, we are subject to increasingly stringent laws, regulations and other requirements, including those affecting, among other areas, our accounting, internal controls, data protection and privacy, corporate governance practices, securities disclosures and reporting.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly aggressive in adopting and enforcing anti-corruption laws.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and China's Criminal Law and Anti-Unfair Competition Law, among others, apply to us and our operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Changes in healthcare laws and regulations may significantly affect the provision of both healthcare services and benefits in the U.S. and may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business, such as the demand for products in our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is subject to statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety, including Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulations and similar regulations in other countries.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Failure to comply with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of devices, or total or partial suspension of production.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We also design, manufacture and service products for certain industries, including certain applications where the U.S. government is the end customer, that face significant regulation by the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Commerce, Federal Aviation Authority, and other governmental agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries, and also under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, whenever we pursue business in new sectors and subsectors, or our customers pursue new technologies or markets, we need to navigate the potentially heavy regulatory and legislative burdens of such sectors, as well as standards of quality systems, technologies or markets.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	For example, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, as well as the financial health of healthcare providers, and changes in how healthcare in the U.S. is structured, and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in this sector as well as impact our margins.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Our customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards, including many of the industry-specific regulations discussed above.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Our customers' failure to comply could affect their businesses, which in turn would affect our sales to them.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S4	In addition, if our customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs for these customers and create inefficiencies in our business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S5	A failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, and third party certification requirements or standards, including those related to social responsibility, could adversely affect our business and reputation.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S6	In addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own or third party quality standards, business policies, commercial terms, or other social responsibility policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S7	Such policies or standards may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third party organizations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S8	Our compliance with these heightened and/or additional policies, standards and third party certification requirements, and managing a supply chain in accordance therewith, could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S9	In addition, our adoption of these standards could adversely affect our cost competiveness, ability to provide customers with required service levels and ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S10	In certain circumstances, to meet the requirements or standards of our customers we may be obligated to select certain suppliers or make other sourcing choices, and we may bear responsibility for adverse outcomes even if these matters are as the result of third party actions or outside of our control.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S11	Changes to financial accounting rules or standards, or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators, may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S12	We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S13	These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S14	From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S15	For example, in 2014 the FASB issued new guidance that impacts revenue recognition criteria and is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S16	The Company has determined that the new standard will result in a change to the timing of revenue recognition for a significant portion of the Company's revenue stream, whereby revenue will be recognized "over time" as production occurs as opposed to at a "point in time" upon physical delivery.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S17	The new standard will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements upon initial adoption, primarily as the Company recognizes an increase in contract assets for unbilled receivables with a corresponding reduction in finished goods and work-in-process inventory.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S18	See also "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted" within Note 1, "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies," in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impacts the new standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S19	The new standard is also expected to have an impact on the Company's ability to forecast financial results in the near term as it begins to implement the standard.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S20	New controls have been adopted and more may be needed to comply with such changes, and we may fail to adequately implement the needed changes.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P48_S21	There may be problems with the products we design, manufacture or service that could result in liability claims against us, reduced demand for our services and damage to our reputation.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The products that we design, manufacture or service may be subject to liability or claims in the event that defects are discovered or alleged.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We design, manufacture and service products to our customers' specifications, many of which are highly complex, and produce products for industries, such as healthcare, aerospace and defense, that have higher risk profiles.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the design, manufacturing or servicing of these products, including as a result of business continuity issues.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	manufacturing processes, servicing, or a component defect, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, such problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	These potential claims may include damages for the recall of a product or injury to person or property.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Even if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S5	While we seek to insure against many of these risks, we may not have practical recourse against certain suppliers, and insurance coverage or supplier warranties may be inadequate, not cost effective or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products or issues.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S6	We occasionally incur costs defending claims, and any such disputes could adversely affect our business relationships.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S7	Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S8	Our services and the products offered by our customers involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S9	In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S10	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S11	In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S12	We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S13	Infringement by our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and disrupt our production.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S14	Additionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S15	Such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products, and could affect our customer relationships more broadly.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P50_S16	Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and components upon which we rely.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Increased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We compete against numerous providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P51_S2	In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of designing, manufacturing and servicing products internally and may choose to design, manufacture or service products (including products or product types that we currently design, manufacture or service for them) themselves rather than outsource such activities.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Consolidations and other changes in our industry may result in a changing competitive landscape.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	be better positioned to compete on price for their services.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or otherwise become increasingly competitive.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or loss of market share.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	We depend on our workforce, including certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel or other personnel disruptions, including the inability to hire and retain sufficient personnel, may harm our business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Our success depends in large part on the continued services of our key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, particularly highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of products.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P53_S5	The competition for these individuals is significant, and the loss of key employees could harm our business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	From time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, promotions, transitions, disability, death and other terminations of service that affect our executive officers and other key employees, including those that are unexpected.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Transitions or other changes in responsibilities among officers and key employees, particularly those that are unanticipated, unplanned or not executed effectively, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, which could have an effect on our results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	We also depend on good relationships with our workforce generally.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Any disruption in our relationships with our personnel, including as a result of potential union organizing activities, work actions or other labor issues, could substantially affect our operations and results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P54_S4	In addition, when we expand operations in either existing areas or new locations, including internationally, we need to attract and retain the services of sufficient qualified personnel to conduct those operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P54_S5	If we fail to retain and maintain sufficient qualified personnel, the operations at those locations, and consequently our financial results, could be adversely affected.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P54_S6	In new or existing facilities we may be subject to local labor practices or union activities, wage pressure and changing wage requirements, increasing healthcare costs, differing employment laws and regulations in various countries, local competition for employees, restrictions on immigration, labor mobility as well as high turnover, and other issues affecting our workforce, all of which could affect operations at particular locations, which also could have adverse effects on our operational results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	As noted above, our adoption of certain third-party standards could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Natural disasters, breaches of security and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis and floods.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	All facilities are subject to other natural or man-made disasters such as those related to weather events or global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism or war, breaches of security, theft or espionage, workplace violence and failures of utilities.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P55_S4	If such an event was to occur, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event, with the impact of the event potentially magnified in areas where we have multiple facilities.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P55_S5	Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P55_S6	In addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P55_S7	If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P55_S8	Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and thus negatively affect our relationships and financial results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P55_S9	Although we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to physical security, we remain at risk of unauthorized access to our facilities and the possible unauthorized use or theft of inventory, information or other physical assets.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P55_S10	If unauthorized persons gain physical access to our facilities, or our physical assets or information are stolen, damaged or used in an unauthorized manner (whether through outside theft or industrial espionage), we could be subject to, among other consequences, negative publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, loss of government contracts, litigation by affected parties or other future financial obligations related to the loss, misuse or theft of our or our customers' data, inventory or physical assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We may fail to secure or maintain necessary additional financing or capital.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Although we have credit facilities, as described below, and successfully replaced our Senior Notes in fiscal 2018, we cannot be certain that our existing credit arrangements will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations and/or increased working capital needs.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, if we do not comply with the covenants under our credit agreement, our ability to borrow under that facility would be adversely affected.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In addition, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit agreement and receivables factoring programs, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations, either due to instability in the global financial markets or otherwise.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P56_S5	We have the potential to increase capacity under our revolving credit facility from $300 million to $500 million with the approval of the lenders.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P56_S6	In addition, we also have receivables factoring programs.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P56_S7	Many of our borrowings are at variable interest rates and therefore our interest expense is subject to increase if rates, including LIBOR, increase.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining new facilities, or through a combination of these methods.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders' ownership interests; we may not be able to offer our securities on attractive or acceptable terms in the event of volatility or weakness in our stock price.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any current or future financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P57_S4	We may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions, as well as strategic arrangements, and may not successfully integrate acquired operations or recognize the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our operating results.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P57_S5	We have previously grown, in part, through acquisitions and strategic arrangements, such as our fiscal 2018 acquisition of the assets of one of the business lines of Cascade Controls, Inc. ("Cascade"), a company that provides new product introduction services.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P57_S6	If we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions, including the acquisition of operations divested by our customers, or similar transactions, this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P57_S7	These risks include: Operating risks, such as:
785786_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	the loss of key employees of acquired businesses.
785786_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	the unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses.

785786_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 89.0%, 89.0% and 90.0%, respectively, of the total cost of sales was variable in nature and fluctuated with sales volumes.
785786_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	Of these amounts, approximately 88% of these costs in each of fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were related to material and component costs.
785786_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	As compared to fiscal 2017, the percentage increase in cost of sales in fiscal 2018 was slightly greater than the 13.7% increase in net sales primarily due to a negative shift in customer mix and the one-time employee bonus.
785786_18_ITEM7_P17_S4	During the three months ended March 31, 2018, due to our ability to access overseas cash as a result of Tax Reform (as defined below), a $13.5 million one-time bonus was approved and paid to full-time, non-executive employees ("one-time employee bonus"), of which $12.6 million impacted cost of sales.

785786_18_ITEM7_P17_S6	Cost of sales for fiscal 2017 decreased $56.4 million , or 2.4% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P17_S7	As compared to fiscal 2016, the percentage decrease in cost of sales in fiscal 2017 was greater than the 1.10% decrease in net sales primarily due to a positive shift in customer mix, then-ongoing supply chain productivity initiatives and decreased inventory obsolescence expenses, which resulted primarily from $2.9 million of inventory losses sustained from a typhoon that impacted the Company's manufacturing facilities in Xiamen, China during fiscal 2016 (the "typhoon-related losses").
785786_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Gross profit for fiscal 2018 increased $1.7 million , or 0.7% , as compared to fiscal 2017 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The primary driver of the increase in gross profit was the net sales increase.
785786_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Gross margin decreased 110 basis points as compared to fiscal 2017.
785786_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	decrease in gross margin as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by the larger percentage increase in cost of sales as compared to the increase in net sales, driven by the factors previously discussed.
785786_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Gross profit for fiscal 2017 increased $28.5 million , or 12.5% , as compared to fiscal 2016 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	Gross margin increased 120 basis points as compared to fiscal 2016.
785786_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	The primary driver of the increases in gross profit and gross margin as compared to fiscal 2017 was the larger percentage decrease in cost of sales as compared to the decrease in net sales, driven by the factors previously discussed.
785786_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Operating income for fiscal 2018 decreased $11.6 million as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of a $13.4 million increase in selling and administrative expenses ("S A"), partially offset by the $1.7 million increase in gross profit.
785786_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The increase in S A in fiscal 2018 primarily resulted from a $5.2 million increase in variable compensation expense and a $2.8 million increase in salary and wage-related expenses.
785786_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	Operating margin decreased to 4.1% in fiscal 2018 from 5.1% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the decrease in gross margin and increase in S A expenses, due to the factors discussed above.
785786_18_ITEM7_P20_S3	Operating income for fiscal 2017 increased $30.5 million as compared to fiscal 2016 as a result of the increase in gross profit and a $7.0 million decrease in restructuring costs, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in S A.

785786_18_ITEM7_P20_S4	The increase in S A in fiscal 2017 resulted from a $3.5 million increase in variable compensation expense as a result of improved ROIC and $2.0 million of increased salary and wage-related expenses, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in share-based compensation expense.
785786_18_ITEM7_P20_S5	While the level of fiscal 2017 share-based compensation expense benefited from the non-recurrence of $5.2 million of accelerated share-based compensation expense related to the retirement of the Company's former President and Chief Executive Officer in fiscal 2016, that effect was partially offset by a non-recurring $2.1 million equity grant in 2017 in connection with his appointment as Executive Chairman of the Board.
785786_18_ITEM7_P20_S6	Operating margin increased to 5.1% in fiscal 2017 from 3.9% in fiscal 2016.

785786_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Operating income decreased $3.3 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 , primarily as a result of increased costs to support new program ramps and a negative shift in customer mix, partially offset by the increase in net sales.
785786_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	Operating income for fiscal 2017 decreased $23.0 million as compared to fiscal 2016 , primarily as a result of the decrease in net sales and increased variable labor costs to support new program ramps.
785786_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	The impact of the decrease in net sales was partially offset by a positive shift in customer mix due in part to decreased net sales to lower margin customers that resulted from disengagements with two customers.
785786_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	Operating income increased $13.8 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 , primarily as a result of the increase in net sales, partially offset by a negative shift in customer mix and increased costs to support new program ramps.
785786_18_ITEM7_P21_S4	Operating income for fiscal 2017 increased $44.6 million as compared to fiscal 2016 , primarily as a result of the increase in net sales, a positive shift in customer mix, supply chain productivity initiatives and decreased inventory obsolescence expenses, which resulted primarily from the $2.9 million of losses sustained in fiscal 2016 from the Xiamen typhoon discussed above.
785786_18_ITEM7_P21_S5	Operating income increased $7.7 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by increased costs to support new program ramps.
785786_18_ITEM7_P21_S6	Operating loss for fiscal 2017 increased $2.5 million as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased labor costs to support new program ramps, partially offset by the impact of the increase in net sales.
785786_18_ITEM7_P21_S7	Other expense for fiscal 2018 increased $2.6 million as compared to fiscal 2017 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P21_S8	The increase in other expense for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in factoring fees related to our accounts receivable purchase program.

785786_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	The decrease in other expense was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange volatility, which resulted in a foreign exchange gain of $2.3 million during fiscal 2017 as compared to a $1.7 million loss during fiscal 2016.
785786_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	This was partially offset by $2.2 million of expense related to the Company's accounts receivable purchase program.
785786_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing Activities" for additional detail on the Company's accounts receivable purchase program.
785786_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Income tax expense and effective annual income tax rates for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , as well as information as to the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform") in fiscal 2018, were as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	(1) We believe the non-GAAP presentation of income tax expense and the effective annual tax rate excluding non-recurring tax items, consisting of those related to Tax Reform and the one-time employee bonus, provides additional insight over the change from the comparative reporting periods by isolating the significant, non-recurring impact of Tax Reform.
785786_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	In addition, the Company believes that its income tax expense, as adjusted, and effective tax rate, as adjusted, enhance the ability of investors to analyze the Company s operating performance and supplement, but do not replace, its income tax expense and effective tax rate calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
785786_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	On December 22, 2017, Tax Reform was enacted and made significant changes to U.S. corporate income tax, including transitioning the U.S. to a dividend exemption system and requiring a deemed dividend on historical undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate.
785786_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	Tax Reform also includes provisions that will impact us beginning in fiscal 2019, such as a U.S. tax on certain foreign low-taxed earnings and a limitation placed on the deductibility of domestic interest expense.
785786_18_ITEM7_P24_S4	The $94.6 million of tax expense recorded during fiscal 2018 includes $85.9 million related to the enactment of Tax Reform.
785786_18_ITEM7_P24_S5	The amount recorded due to Tax Reform incorporates regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state tax agencies, and includes the use of current year tax losses and net operating loss carry forwards.
785786_18_ITEM7_P24_S6	Also included in the fiscal 2018 income tax expense is a $3.6 million benefit for the valuation allowance released against the net deferred tax assets in the U.S. as we expect the U.S. to have future taxable income due to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provisions of Tax Reform.
785786_18_ITEM7_P24_S7	We consider the tax expense recorded for Tax Reform to be complete at this time.
785786_18_ITEM7_P24_S8	However, it is possible that additional legislation, regulations and/or guidance may be issued within the provisional reporting period that may result in additional adjustments to the tax expense recorded related to Tax Reform.
785786_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	As a result of Tax Reform, our blended U.S. statutory rate for fiscal 2018 is 24.5%.
785786_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	This results from a statutory tax rate of 35% for the first three months of fiscal 2018, and a statutory tax rate of 21% for the remainder of fiscal 2018.
785786_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our annual effective tax rate varies from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings as well as a tax holiday granted to a subsidiary located in the APAC segment where the Company derives a significant portion of our earnings.
785786_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	In addition, our effective tax rate has been impacted by the changes due to Tax Reform discussed above.
785786_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Our effective tax rate also may be impacted by disputes with taxing authorities, tax planning activities, adjustments to uncertain tax positions and changes in valuation allowances.
785786_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	The Company has been granted a tax holiday for a foreign subsidiary operating in the APAC segment.
785786_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	This tax holiday will expire on December 31, 2024, and is subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to continue to comply.
785786_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	per diluted share), $37.5 million ($1.11 per basic share, $1.08 per diluted share), and $27.1 million ($0.81 per basic share, $0.79 per diluted share), respectively.
785786_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	See also Note 6, "Income Taxes," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company s tax rate.
785786_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is expected to be approximately 13.0% to 15.0%.
785786_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	Net income for fiscal 2018 decreased $99.1 million , or 88.4% , from fiscal 2017 to $13.0 million .
785786_18_ITEM7_P27_S4	Net income decreased primarily as a result of the $84.8 million increase in income tax expense, which as noted above was substantially due to the impact of Tax Reform, and increases in S A, as discussed previously.
785786_18_ITEM7_P27_S5	Net income for fiscal 2017 increased $35.7 million , or 46.7% , from fiscal 2016 to $112.1 million .
785786_18_ITEM7_P27_S6	Net income increased primarily as a result of increased gross profit, decreased restructuring costs and decreased foreign exchange losses, partially offset by increases in S A, as discussed previously.
785786_18_ITEM7_P27_S7	Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , as well as information as to the effects of non-recurring events that occurred in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2016, as previously discussed and detailed below, were as follows (dollars in millions):
785786_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	(1) During fiscal 2016, $5.2 million of accelerated stock-based compensation expense was recorded in selling and administrative expenses related to a retirement agreement with the Company's former Chief Executive Officer.
785786_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	(2) We believe the non-GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share excluding non-recurring tax items, consisting of those related to Tax Reform and the one-time employee bonus, as well as the impacts of the typhoon-related losses, accelerated stock-based compensation expense and restructuring costs, provide additional insight over the change from the comparative reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring or unusual items.
785786_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	In addition, the Company believes that its diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, enhances the ability of investors to analyze the Company s operating performance and supplements, but does not replace, its diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
785786_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.38 in fiscal 2018 from $3.24 in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of decreased net income due to the factors discussed above.
785786_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	Diluted earnings per share increased to $3.24 in fiscal 2017 from $2.24 in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of increased net income.
785786_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Economic Return.
785786_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	We use a financial model that is aligned with our business strategy and includes a ROIC goal of 500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), which we refer to as "Economic Return," and a 4.7% to 5.0% operating margin target.
785786_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	Our primary focus is on our Economic Return goal of 5.0%, which is designed to create shareholder value and generate sufficient cash to self-fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of 12.0%.
785786_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	ROIC and Economic Return are non-GAAP financial measures.
785786_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC and Economic Return, are used for internal management goals and decision making because such measures provide management and investors additional insight into financial performance.
785786_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	In particular, we provide ROIC and Economic Return because we believe they offer insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view ROIC and Economic Return as important measures in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital requirements.
785786_18_ITEM7_P30_S3	We also use a derivative measure of ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation, and certain compensation incentives are based on Economic Return performance.
785786_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	We define ROIC as tax-effected operating income before restructuring and other special items divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period for the fiscal year.
785786_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents.
785786_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way.
785786_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
785786_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	We review our internal calculation of WACC annually.
785786_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Our WACC was 9.5% for fiscal year 2018 , 10.5% for fiscal year 2017 , and 11.0% for fiscal year 2016 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders.
785786_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	ROIC was 16.1% , 16.2% , and 13.8% for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
785786_18_ITEM7_P33_S4	Fiscal 2018 ROIC of 16.1% reflects an Economic Return of 6.6% , based on our weighted average cost of capital of 9.5% .
785786_18_ITEM7_P33_S5	For a reconciliation of ROIC, Economic Return and adjusted operating income (tax effected) to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.
785786_18_ITEM7_P33_S6	Refer to the table below, which includes the calculation of ROIC and Economic Return (dollars in millions) for the indicated periods:
785786_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $297.7 million as of September 29, 2018 , as compared to $569.3 million as of September 30, 2017 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	As of September 29, 2018 , 68.6% of our cash balance was held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries.
785786_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	With the enactment of Tax Reform, we believe that our offshore cash can be accessed in a more tax efficient manner than before Tax Reform.
785786_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	As previously discussed, we recorded $85.9 million of tax expense during fiscal 2018, which was associated with the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and the reversal of our permanently reinvested assertion on foreign earnings in connection with Tax Reform.
785786_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	During fiscal 2018 we repatriated approximately $431.2 million from our APAC region.
785786_18_ITEM7_P34_S5	We repaid $175.0 million in principal amount of our Senior Notes that matured on June 15, 2018 (the "2011 Notes") with $25.0 million of available cash and proceeds from the issuance of $150.0 million in principal of the 2018 Notes (as defined below).
785786_18_ITEM7_P34_S6	Currently, we believe that our cash balance, together with cash available under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including potential share repurchases, for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.
785786_18_ITEM7_P34_S7	Our future cash flows from operating activities will be reduced by $72.5 million due to cash payments for accrued income taxes related to Tax Reform.
785786_18_ITEM7_P34_S8	The table below provides the expected timing of these future cash outflows, excluding $11.5 million of foreign withholding taxes and state taxes on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings since the exact timing of the payments is unknown as of September 29, 2018 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P34_S9	The remaining $61.0 million represents U.S. federal taxes on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings that are payable over an eight year period in accordance with the following installment schedule beginning in fiscal 2019 (in millions):
785786_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table provides a summary of cash flows for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , excluding the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (in millions):
785786_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $66.8 million for fiscal 2018 , as compared to $171.7 million for fiscal 2017 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	The decrease was primarily due to cash flow (reductions) improvements of:
785786_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	$86.4 million in accounts payables cash flows driven by increased purchasing activity to support increased net sales.
785786_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $171.7 million for fiscal 2017 , as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $127.7 million for fiscal 2016 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The improvement was primarily due to the increase in net income and a $13.9 million change in working capital, as discussed below.
785786_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	Working capital cash flows in fiscal 2017 improved as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to working capital cash flow improvements and (reductions) of:
785786_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	$(11.7) million in other current and noncurrent assets cash flows resulting from increases in prepaid arrangements.
785786_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	The following table provides a summary of cash cycle days for the periods indicated (in days):
785786_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	We calculate days in accounts receivable as accounts receivable for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	We calculate days in inventory, accounts payable, and cash deposits as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the respective quarter by day.
785786_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	We calculate annualized cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits.
785786_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	As of September 29, 2018 , annualized cash cycle days increased three days compared to September 30, 2017 due to the following factors: Days in accounts receivable for the three months ended September 29, 2018 decreased three days compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P39_S4	The decrease is primarily attributable to an $82.0 million increase in accounts receivable sold under factoring programs during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, which was partially offset by the increase in net sales and unfavorable changes to payment terms with certain customers.
785786_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Days in inventory for the three months ended September 29, 2018 increased five days compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	The increase is primarily driven by an increase in inventory levels as a result of experiencing longer lead times for certain components for new programs and to support new program ramps.
785786_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	In order to maintain a high level of customer service, we are procuring components earlier, which has led to the increase in inventory.
785786_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	Days in accounts payable for the three months ended September 29, 2018 increased three days compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P40_S4	The increase is primarily driven by increased purchasing activity to support higher revenue levels.
785786_18_ITEM7_P40_S5	Days in cash deposits for the three months ended September 29, 2018 decreased four days compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P40_S6	The decrease was primarily attributable to significant deposits received from several customers in fiscal 2017 that were utilized or returned during fiscal 2018.
785786_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	We define free cash flow ("FCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash flow provided by operations less capital expenditures.
785786_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	FCF was $4.0 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $133.2 million for fiscal 2017 , a decrease of $129.2 million .
785786_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	Non-GAAP financial measures, including FCF, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight to investors into ongoing financial performance.
785786_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	In particular, we provide FCF because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions.
785786_18_ITEM7_P41_S4	We view FCF as an important financial metric as it demonstrates our ability to generate cash and can allow us to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.
785786_18_ITEM7_P41_S5	FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
785786_18_ITEM7_P41_S6	A reconciliation of FCF to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP follows (in millions):
785786_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Cash flows used in investing activities were $74.6 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $37.8 million for fiscal 2017 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to a $24.3 million increase in capital expenditures primarily to fund the purchase of an additional manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia and to support new capabilities, new program ramps, and to replace or refresh older equipment.
785786_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	There was an additional $12.4 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities for the acquisition of the assets of one of the business lines of Cascade Controls, Inc.; see Note 15, "Acquisition," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.
785786_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	Cash flows used in investing activities were $37.8 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $26.5 million for fiscal 2016 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P42_S4	The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to a $7.4 million increase in capital expenditures primarily to support new capabilities, new program ramps, and to replace or refresh older equipment, and a $3.9 million decrease in proceeds received from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily related to the sale of our former engineering facility in Neenah, Wisconsin in fiscal 2016.
785786_18_ITEM7_P42_S5	We utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal 2018 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P42_S6	We currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 will be approximately $70.0 million to $90.0 million.
785786_18_ITEM7_P42_S7	Cash flows used in financing activities were $265.5 million for fiscal 2018 compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $1.3 million for fiscal 2017 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P42_S8	The increase was primarily attributable to a $141.0 million increase in pay-downs on our revolving credit facility, a $102.9 million increase in cash used to repurchase our common stock and a $25.0 million reduction in the balance of outstanding senior notes as a result of refinancing the notes, as discussed further below.
785786_18_ITEM7_P42_S9	Cash flows provided by financing activities were $1.3 million for fiscal 2017 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $21.3 million for fiscal 2016 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P42_S10	The increase was primarily attributable to a net $32.8 million increase in borrowings, which was partially offset by a $4.1 million increase in cash used to repurchase our shares under the stock repurchase program described below, a $3.5 million increase in payments related to tax withholding for share-based compensation and a $3.0 million decrease in proceeds received from stock option exercises.
785786_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	On February 14, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan under which the Company is authorized to repurchase $200.0 million of its common stock (the "2018 Program").
785786_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	During fiscal 2018 , the Company repurchased 343,642 shares under the 2018 Program for $21.2 million , at an average price of $61.61 per share.
785786_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	As of September 29, 2018 , $178.8 million of authority remained under the 2018 Program.
785786_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	On June 6, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a multi-year stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $150.0 million of its common stock beginning in fiscal 2017 (the "2016 Program").
785786_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	During fiscal 2018 and 2017 , the Company completed the 2016 Program by repurchasing 1,914,596 and 655,470 shares for $115.9 million and $34.1 million , at an average price of $60.52 and $52.08 per share, respectively.
785786_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	On August 20, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock during fiscal 2016.
785786_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	During fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased 760,903 shares for $30.0 million , at an average price of $39.43 per share.
785786_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	All shares repurchased under the aforementioned programs were recorded as treasury stock.
785786_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	On June 15, 2018, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the 2018 NPA ) pursuant to which it issued an aggregate of $150.0 million in principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $100.0 million in principal amount of 4.05% Series A Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2025, and $50.0 million in principal amount of 4.22% Series B Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2028 (collectively, the 2018 Notes ), in a private placement.
785786_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	The 2018 NPA includes customary operational and financial covenants with which the Company is required to comply, including, among others, maintenance of certain financial ratios such as a total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
785786_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	The 2018 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, subject to payment of a make-whole amount; interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semiannually.
785786_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	As of September 29, 2018 , the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the 2018 NPA.
785786_18_ITEM7_P47_S4	In connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, on June 15, 2018, the Company repaid, on maturity $175.0 million in principal amount of its 5.20% Senior Notes (the "2011 Notes").
785786_18_ITEM7_P47_S5	The Company's Credit Facility has a $300.0 million maximum commitment that expires on July 5, 2021 .
785786_18_ITEM7_P47_S6	The Credit Facility may be further increased to $500.0 million , generally by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, subject to certain customary conditions.
785786_18_ITEM7_P47_S7	For further information regarding the Credit Facility, see Note 4, "Debt, Capital Lease Obligations and Other Financing" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	The financial covenants (as defined under the Credit Agreement) require, among other covenants, that the Company maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
785786_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	As of September 29, 2018 , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit Agreement.
785786_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	The Credit Agreement and the 2018 NPA allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the repurchase of shares provided that no event of default (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases.
785786_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	We have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not currently anticipate paying them in the future.
785786_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	However, we evaluate from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases above those already authorized, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
785786_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Company has Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreements with MUFG Bank, New York Branch, formerly known as The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (the "MUFG RPA"), and HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Xiamen branch (the "HSBC RPA"), under which the Company may elect to sell receivables, at a discount, on an ongoing basis.
785786_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	The MUFG RPA was amended on September 19, 2018 to increase the maximum facility amount from $210.0 million to $230.0 million .
785786_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	The maximum facility amount under the HSBC RPA as of September 29, 2018 is $60.0 million .
785786_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	The MUFG RPA is subject to expiration on October 3, 2019, but will be automatically extended each year unless any party gives no less than 10 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended.
785786_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	The terms of the HSBC RPA are generally consistent with the terms of the MUFG RPA discussed above.
785786_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	The Company previously sold receivables under a former trade accounts receivable sale program that expired during the first fiscal quarter of 2017.
785786_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	The Company sold $712.9 million , $418.0 million and $65.6 million of trade accounts receivable under these programs during fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, in exchange for cash proceeds of $708.6 million , $415.8 million and $65.0 million , respectively.
785786_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	In all cases, the sale discount was recorded within "Miscellaneous expense" in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period of the sale.
785786_18_ITEM7_P50_S4	For further information regarding the receivable sale programs, see Note 14, "Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents, potential borrowings under the Credit Facility and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months.
785786_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing.
785786_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources.
785786_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms.
785786_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS Our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings.

785786_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	During fiscal 2018 , there were no material changes to these policies.
785786_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Our more critical accounting estimates are described below: Revenue Recognition: Net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped, the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and recoverability is reasonably assured.
785786_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	This point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from Plexus.
785786_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.
785786_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	Net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling.
785786_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	The corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
785786_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as program costs are incurred by utilizing the proportional performance model.
785786_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist.
785786_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	Any losses are recognized when anticipated.
785786_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
785786_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
785786_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
785786_18_ITEM7_P60_S3	In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.
785786_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Share-Based Compensation: Generally accepted accounting principles require all grants of share-based compensation to employees to be measured at fair value and expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant.
785786_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value stock options and the Monte Carlo valuation model to value performance stock units with market conditions.
785786_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
785786_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
785786_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment.
785786_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond the Company s control.
785786_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory.
785786_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	Any actions taken by the Company s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.
785786_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups may not be recoverable through estimated future undiscounted cash flows.
785786_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a charge against current operations.
785786_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	The impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
785786_18_ITEM7_P65_S3	Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.
785786_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Accounts receivable are reflected at net realizable value based on anticipated losses due to potentially uncollectible balances.
785786_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	Anticipated losses are based on management s analysis of historical losses and changes in customers credit status.
785786_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	Warranties: The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized and establishes additional reserves for specifically identified product issues.
785786_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	The primary factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the value and the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims.
785786_18_ITEM7_P66_S4	As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
785786_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
785786_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Foreign Currency Risk Our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk.
785786_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
785786_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
785786_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges.
785786_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the indicated fiscal years were as follows:
785786_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above.
785786_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Based on the Company s overall currency exposure, as of September 29, 2018 , a 10.0% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
785786_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have financial instruments, including cash equivalents and debt, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
785786_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk.
785786_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	To achieve this, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of highly rated securities, money market funds and certificates of deposit, and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer.
785786_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	NOTE: All other financial statement schedules are omitted because they are not applicable or the required information is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto.

785786_18_ITEM8_P3_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
785786_18_ITEM8_P3_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
785786_18_ITEM8_P3_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

785786_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

785786_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described below.
785786_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
785786_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
785786_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.
785786_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	The input levels are: Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
785786_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
785786_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.
785786_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Business and Credit Concentrations: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and derivative instruments, specifically related to counterparties.

785786_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	The Company also closely monitors extensions of credit.
785786_18_ITEM8_P46_S2	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted:
785786_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2017-12 related to the accounting for hedging activities.
785786_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	The pronouncement expands and refines hedge accounting, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
785786_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and early adoption is permitted.
785786_18_ITEM8_P47_S3	The Company is finalizing its assessment of the impact of the guidance, but does not believe it will have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16 related to the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
785786_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	The new standard eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs.
785786_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is permitted.
785786_18_ITEM8_P48_S3	This guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
785786_18_ITEM8_P48_S4	The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments, which clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows.
785786_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	The new standard addresses certain issues where diversity in practice was identified.
785786_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	It also amends existing guidance, which is principles based and often requires judgment to determine the appropriate classification of cash flows as operating, investing or financing activities and clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.
785786_18_ITEM8_P49_S3	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
785786_18_ITEM8_P49_S4	The Company is finalizing its assessment of the impact of the guidance, but does not believe it will have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
785786_18_ITEM8_P49_S5	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets but record expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting.
785786_18_ITEM8_P49_S6	For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases.
785786_18_ITEM8_P49_S7	The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
785786_18_ITEM8_P49_S8	The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of the new standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements and the timing of adoption.
785786_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize revenue relating to contracts with customers that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services ("Topic 606").
785786_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	Topic 606 also requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers and is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
785786_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company developed a comprehensive project plan that included a global cross-functional team of representatives to conduct an assessment of Topic 606 and its potential impacts on the Company.
785786_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	The project plan included analyzing the standard s impact on the Company s various revenue streams, comparing its historical accounting policies and practices to the requirements of the new standard, and identifying potential differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to its contracts.
785786_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Company is in the process of implementing appropriate changes to its current accounting policies, business processes, systems and controls to support revenue recognition and disclosures under Topic 606.
785786_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company has determined that the new standard will result in a change to the timing of revenue recognition for a significant portion of the Company's revenue, whereby revenue will be recognized "over time," as products are produced, as opposed to at a "point in time" upon physical delivery.
785786_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	Upon adopting the standard, revenue will be recognized over time for arrangements with customers for which: (i) the Company's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company, and (ii) the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
785786_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	Over time, revenue will be estimated using a cost-based input measurement of progress, under which the extent of progress towards completion will be measured based on the costs incurred during the manufacturing process or as services are rendered as of each period end.
785786_18_ITEM8_P52_S3	If either of the two conditions are not met, revenue will be recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying arrangement.
785786_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	The new standard is expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements upon initial adoption, primarily as the Company recognizes an increase in contract assets for unbilled receivables with a corresponding reduction in finished goods and work-in-process inventory.
785786_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Company is adopting Topic 606 at the beginning of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective approach.
785786_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	Upon adoption of the standard, the Company estimates an adjustment to its beginning Retained Earnings balance in the range of $5.0 million to $15.0 million as of September 29, 2018.
785786_18_ITEM8_P53_S3	In addition, the Company estimates reductions to finished goods and work-in-progress inventories in the range of $45.0 million to $70.0 million in aggregate.
785786_18_ITEM8_P53_S4	The Company estimates a corresponding increase to Unbilled Receivables of approximately $55.0 million to $80.0 million .
785786_18_ITEM8_P53_S5	While the Company is substantially complete with the process of quantifying the impacts that will result from applying the new guidance, its assessment will be finalized during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
785786_18_ITEM8_P53_S6	The Company has substantially completed the implementation of changes to its processes, policies and internal controls to comply with the new standard and disclosure requirements.
785786_18_ITEM8_P53_S7	The Company believes that no other recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, or apply to its operations.

785786_18_ITEM8_P116_S5	Such warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects in the Company s workmanship and meet mutually agreed-upon specifications for periods generally ranging from 12 months to 24 months.
785786_18_ITEM8_P116_S6	The Company s obligation is generally limited to correcting, at its expense, any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product.
785786_18_ITEM8_P116_S7	The Company s warranty generally excludes defects resulting from faulty customer-supplied components, design defects or damage caused by any party or cause other than the Company.
785786_18_ITEM8_P116_S8	The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized and establishes additional reserves for specifically identified product issues.
785786_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	The primary factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include the value and the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims.
785786_18_ITEM8_P117_S1	As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
785786_18_ITEM8_P117_S2	Below is a table summarizing the activity related to the Company s limited warranty liability for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

(the "MUFG RPA"), and HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Xiamen branch (the "HSBC RPA"), under which the Company may elect to sell receivables, at a discount, on an ongoing basis.

785786_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	The Company sold receivables under a former trade accounts receivable sale program that expired during the first fiscal quarter of 2017.
785786_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	Transfers of receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
785786_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	Proceeds from the transfer reflect the face value of the receivables less a discount.
785786_18_ITEM8_P123_S2	The sale discount is recorded within "Miscellaneous expense" in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period of the sale.
785786_18_ITEM8_P123_S3	The Company sold $712.9 million , $418.0 million and $65.6 million of trade accounts receivable under these programs, or their predecessors, during fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, in exchange for cash proceeds of $708.6 million , $415.8 million and $65.0 million , respectively.

785786_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	Plexus acquired substantially all of the inventory, equipment and other assets of the business line, hired a majority of its employees and sub-leased one of Cascade's facilities.
785786_18_ITEM8_P124_S2	This transaction has been accounted for as a business combination.
785786_18_ITEM8_P124_S3	The acquisition resulted in a $12.4 million cash outflow included in "Business acquisition" in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and $8.2 million of intangible assets related to customer relationships, which is included in "Intangible assets" in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
785786_18_ITEM8_P124_S4	The intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis and result in amortization expense for fiscal 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 of approximately $1.2 million per year.
785786_18_ITEM8_P124_S5	There were no other material impacts to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the acquisition.
785786_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	Restructuring Costs The Company incurred no restructuring costs during fiscal 2018 or 2017.
785786_18_ITEM8_P125_S1	During fiscal 2016 the Company recorded $7.0 million of restructuring costs related largely to the Company's closure of its manufacturing facility in Fremont, California.
785786_18_ITEM8_P125_S2	The Company also recorded restructuring costs in the EMEA segment in fiscal 2016 related to the partial closure of its Livingston, Scotland facility.

785786_18_ITEM8_P125_S4	Restructuring liabilities are recorded within "Other accrued liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
785786_18_ITEM8_P125_S5	No income tax benefit for these restructuring costs was recognized in fiscal 2017 or 2016 due to tax losses in these jurisdictions.
785786_18_ITEM8_P125_S6	The Company's restructuring accrual activity for the years ended September 29, 2018 , September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 is included in the table below (in thousands):

785786_18_ITEM8_P127_S2	The fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 results included $38.6 million of non-recurring tax benefits as well as a $3.6 million benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets.
785786_18_ITEM8_P127_S3	These benefits were partially offset by $1.1 million of tax expense for other non-recurring tax items.
785786_18_ITEM8_P127_S4	Refer to Note 6, "Income Taxes," for further details on Tax Reform.
785786_18_ITEM8_P127_S5	(3) The annual total amounts may not equal the sum of the quarterly amounts due to rounding.
785786_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	Earnings per share is computed independently for each quarter.
785786_18_ITEM8_P128_S1	(4) The first quarter of fiscal 2018 includes $3.59 per share of tax expense as a result of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform and $0.09 per share that resulted from 1.1 million of weighted average potentially-dilutive shares that were excluded from the diluted shares calculation due to the net loss position.
785786_18_ITEM8_P128_S2	The second quarter of fiscal 2018 includes $0.38 per share of expense related to the one-time employee bonus.
785786_18_ITEM8_P128_S3	The fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 includes $1.24 per share of non-recurring tax benefits.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") have reviewed and evaluated, with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this report.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on such evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of September 29, 2018 , the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, (a) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, and (b) in assuring that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
785786_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management of the Company, including its CEO and CFO, has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2018 , based on the criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") (2013).
785786_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on its assessment and those criteria, management has reached the conclusion that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2018 , as stated in its report included herein.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P3_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P3_S5	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P3_S6	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
785786_18_ITEM9A_P3_S7	Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have nonetheless reached the conclusion that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective at the reasonable assurance level.
