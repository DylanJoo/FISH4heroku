898173_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its subsidiaries, collectively we , O Reilly or the Company , is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ( DIY ) customers and professional service providers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Reilly, Sr. and initially operated from a single store in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company s common stock has traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ORLY since April 22, 1993.
898173_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	On December 29, 2010, we completed a corporate reorganization creating a holding company structure (the Reorganization ).
898173_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Reorganization was implemented through an agreement and plan of merger under Section 351.448 of The General Corporation Law of the State of Missouri, which did not require a vote of the shareholders.
898173_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	As a result of the Reorganization, the previous parent company and registrant, O Reilly Automotive, Inc., was renamed O Reilly Automotive Stores, Inc.
898173_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	( Old O Reilly ) and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent company and registrant, which was renamed O Reilly Automotive, Inc.
898173_11_ITEM1_P3_S4	In the Reorganization, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Old O Reilly was converted into a share of common stock of the Company, with the same designations, rights, qualifications, powers, preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions, and without any action being required on the part of holders of shares of Old O Reilly common stock or any exchange of stock certificates.
898173_11_ITEM1_P3_S5	Shares of the Company s common stock were substituted for the shares of common stock of Old O Reilly listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market and continue to trade under the same ORLY symbol but with a new CUSIP Number (67103H 107).
898173_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	At December 31, 2010, we operated 3,570 stores in 38 states.
898173_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our stores carry an extensive product line, including the products bulleted below:
898173_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	accessories, such as floor mats, seat covers and truck accessories.
898173_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	Many of our stores offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including those bulleted below:
898173_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	store count at the date of acquisition.
898173_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	To fund the transaction, we entered into a Credit Agreement ( ABL Credit Agreement ) on the acquisition date for a $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) arranged by Bank of America, N.A. ( BA ), which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined company going forward.
898173_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	The results of CSK s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.
898173_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	At the date of the acquisition, CSK had 1,342 stores in 22 states, operating under four brand names: Checker Auto Parts, Schuck s Auto Supply, Kragen Auto Parts and Murray s Discount Auto Parts.
898173_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	This acquisition added stores in twelve new states:
898173_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington, and a number of new markets in states where O Reilly had a presence prior to the acquisition.
898173_11_ITEM1_P8_S3	The integration of CSK has focused on the implementation of our dual market strategy, the ability to effectively serve both DIY customers and professional service providers, which required conversion of store and distribution information systems, enhancements to the distribution infrastructure, inventory offerings and the infusion of the O Reilly culture into the acquired CSK stores.
898173_11_ITEM1_P8_S4	Conversion of all CSK stores to the O Reilly systems began in October of 2008 and concluded in November of 2010.
898173_11_ITEM1_P8_S5	Store d cor and graphic package changeovers will be completed in all CSK stores by the end of the second quarter of 2011.
898173_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	In order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the CSK store network, we added distribution centers ( DC ) in Seattle, Washington, in November of 2009; Moreno Valley, California, in January of 2010; Denver, Colorado, in March of 2010; and Salt Lake City, Utah, in May of 2010.
898173_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	We also relocated an existing CSK DC in Dixon, California, to a larger DC in Stockton, California, and converted two existing CSK DCs, one in Detroit, Michigan, and one in Phoenix, Arizona, to the O Reilly systems.
898173_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had converted all CSK stores to O Reilly systems, merged 41 CSK stores with existing O Reilly locations, closed 17 CSK stores and opened five new stores in CSK historical markets.
898173_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	See Risk Factors beginning on page 14 for a description of certain risks relevant to our business.
898173_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	These risk factors include, among others, risks related to our growth strategy, the integration of CSK, increased debt levels, our acquisition strategies, competition in the automotive aftermarket business, our dependence upon key and other personnel, future growth assurance, our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, legal proceedings and related matters arising from CSK, the effect of sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, our relationships with key vendors and availability of key products, complications in our DCs, deteriorating economic conditions, downgrade in credit rating and environmental legislation and regulations.
898173_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our Business Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy.
898173_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and core O Reilly values of customer service and expense control.
898173_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	Our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing superior customer service and significant value to both professional service providers and DIY customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P11_S3	We have an established track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY customers and professional service providers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P11_S4	We believe our ability to execute a dual market strategy is a competitive advantage.
898173_11_ITEM1_P11_S5	The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts, by capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure, by operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors, as well as by enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P11_S6	We have been committed to our dual market strategy for over 30 years.
898173_11_ITEM1_P11_S7	In 2010, we derived approximately 62% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 38% of our sales from our professional service provider customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P11_S8	We have historically derived approximately 50% of our sales from both our DIY and professional service provider customers, and as we continue to grow our commercial business in the acquired CSK stores, we would expect our DIY and professional service provider sales mix to approximate historical averages.
898173_11_ITEM1_P11_S9	As a result of our historical success of executing our dual market strategy and our over 450 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider, we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional service providers and will continue to have a competitive advantage over our retail competitors who derive a high concentration of their sales from the DIY market.
898173_11_ITEM1_P11_S10	We have a tremendous opportunity to build on the strong retail base at the acquired CSK stores by growing the commercial business through the implementation of our dual market strategy and capitalizing on our other competitive advantages.
898173_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Superior Customer Service - We seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are bulleted below:
898173_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	competitive pricing, supported by a good, better, best product assortment designed to meet all of our customers quality and value preferences.
898173_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Technically Proficient Professional Parts People - Our highly proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators.
898173_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard parts, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service providers with whom they interact on a daily basis.
898173_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People.
898173_11_ITEM1_P14_S3	Strategic Distribution Systems - We believe our commitment to a robust, regional DC network provides for superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network.
898173_11_ITEM1_P14_S4	Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, providing for efficient inventory control and management.
898173_11_ITEM1_P14_S5	Our distribution system provides each of our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 118,000 stock keeping units ( SKUs ), many of which are hard to find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P14_S6	We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.
898173_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	We currently operate 23 DCs, four of which opened in 2010.
898173_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	As these DCs opened, the surrounding CSK stores were converted to the O Reilly systems and began receiving same-day or overnight access to O Reilly s broad range of hard part product offerings.
898173_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	Experienced Management Team - Our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan, including the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions.
898173_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	We have experienced eighteen consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993.
898173_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	We have a strong senior management team comprised of 146 professionals who average 18 years of service.
898173_11_ITEM1_P16_S3	In addition, our 260 corporate managers average 15 years of service and our 349 district managers average 13 years of service.
898173_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Aggressively Open New Stores - We intend to continue to open new stores to achieve greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new, contiguous markets.
898173_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	We plan to open approximately 170 net new stores in 2011, and the sites for these new stores have been identified.
898173_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O Reilly stores.
898173_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	We typically open new stores either by (i) constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory, (ii) acquiring an independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store, or (iii) purchasing multi-store chains.
898173_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	New store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities, competing auto parts stores within a pre-determined radius, and the operational strength of such competitors.
898173_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network.
898173_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and achieve our goal of continued sales/profit growth within these markets.
898173_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	Consequently, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.
898173_11_ITEM1_P19_S4	Profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy.
898173_11_ITEM1_P19_S5	To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P19_S6	We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability.
898173_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Although the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, we believe the ability of national retail chains, such as ourselves, to operate more efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result in continued industry consolidation.
898173_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Thus, our intention is to continue to selectively pursue acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier.
898173_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Continually Enhance Store Design and Location - Our current prototype store design features enhancements such as optimized square footage, higher ceilings, more convenient interior store layouts, improved in-store signage, brighter lighting, increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance customer service.
898173_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance.
898173_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best serve our customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P21_S3	In order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the acquired CSK store network and grow our share of the professional service provider market in those areas, we have added four additional DCs to the Western markets since the CSK acquisition.
898173_11_ITEM1_P21_S4	Our strategically located DCs provide converted CSK stores with same-day or overnight delivery access to an average of 118,000 SKUs and will give these stores an important tool to provide industry-leading customer service to the professional service provider, as well as the DIY customer.
898173_11_ITEM1_P21_S5	In addition, our Professional Parts People receive ongoing training on our product lines, customer service and O Reilly policies and procedures aimed at building and improving relationships with professional service providers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	Each of our 349 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores, which provides our stores with the appropriate amount of operational support.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	District managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	Store managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a 40-hour manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S4	District managers and store managers also receive continuous training through on-line assignments, field workshops and regional meetings.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S5	We provide financial incentives to our district managers and all store team members through incentive compensation programs.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S6	Under our incentive compensation programs, base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based upon their individual and/or store s sales and profitability.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S7	In addition, each of our district and store managers participates in the Company s stock option program.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S8	We believe that our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our district and store team members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S9	Most of our current senior management, district managers and store managers were promoted to their positions from within the Company.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S10	Our senior management team averages 18 years of service, corporate management team averages 15 years of service and our district management team has an average length of service of 13 years.
898173_11_ITEM1_P22_S11	Team Members As of January 31, 2011, we employed 47,142 total team members (31,070 full-time team members and 16,072 part-time team members), of whom 39,556 were employed at our stores, 6,053 were employed at our DCs and 1,533 were employed at our corporate and regional offices.
898173_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	A union represents 51 stores (435 team members) in the Greater Bay Area in California, and has for many years.
898173_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	In addition, approximately 66 team members who drive over-the-road trucks in two of our DCs have voted in favor of becoming represented by labor unions; however, no collective bargaining agreements have been negotiated.
898173_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	Except for these team members, our team members are not represented by labor unions.
898173_11_ITEM1_P23_S3	Our tradition of 54 years has been to treat all of our team members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our Live Green Culture, which emphasizes the importance of every team member s contribution to the success of O Reilly.
898173_11_ITEM1_P23_S4	This focus on professionalism and fairness has created an industry-leading team and we consider our relations with our team members to be excellent.
898173_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Inflation and Seasonality We have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	To the extent our acquisition cost increases due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
898173_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Regulations We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, including those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.
898173_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our oil and battery recycling programs.
898173_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores of ours as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party vendors.
898173_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates, deposited into vendor-supplied containers and pallets, and then disposed of by the third-party vendors.
898173_11_ITEM1_P27_S4	In general, our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the vendor.
898173_11_ITEM1_P27_S5	Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date.
898173_11_ITEM1_P27_S6	We cannot give any assurance, however, that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such law or regulation.
898173_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Interested readers can access, free of charge, the Company s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, through the Securities and Exchange Commission website at www.sec.gov and searching with our ticker symbol ORLY .
898173_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Such reports are generally available the day they are filed.
898173_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	Upon request, the Company will furnish interested readers a paper copy of such reports free of charge by contacting Thomas McFall, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, at 233 South Patterson, Springfield, Missouri, 65802.
898173_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Store Operations Store Network Store Locations - As a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	The following table sets forth the geographic distribution of our stores:
898173_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our stores, on average, carry approximately 22,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,100 total square feet in size.
898173_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	At December 31, 2010, we had a total of approximately 25.3 million square feet in our 3,570 stores.
898173_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 118,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 184 Master Inventory Stores, which on average carry approximately 39,000 SKUs and average approximately 10,000 square feet in size.
898173_11_ITEM1_P30_S3	In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Master Inventory Stores also provide our other stores within the surrounding area access to a greater selection of SKUs on a same-day basis.
898173_11_ITEM1_P30_S4	We believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity.
898173_11_ITEM1_P30_S5	Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings and prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares, and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Store Layout - We utilize a computer-assisted plan-o-grammed store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent merchandise presentation; however, each store s hard-parts inventory assortment is customized to meet the specific needs of a particular market area.
898173_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	Front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access, maximum selling space and to prominently display high-turnover products and accessories to customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	To ensure the best customer experience possible, we have selectively implemented bilingual in-store signage based on the demographics in each store s geographic area.
898173_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Aisle displays and end caps are used to feature high-demand or seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.
898173_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Store Automation - To enhance store-level operations, customer service and reliability, we use Linux servers and IBM I-Series computer systems in our stores.
898173_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	These systems are linked with the I-Series computers located in each of our DCs.
898173_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our point-of-sale terminals provide immediate access to our electronic catalog to graphically display parts and pricing information by make, model and year of vehicle and use bar code scanning technology to price our merchandise.
898173_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	This system speeds transaction times, reduces the customer s checkout time, ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service.
898173_11_ITEM1_P33_S4	Moreover, our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management, strategic planning, inventory control and distribution efficiency.
898173_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are bulleted below:
898173_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	physical location, size, economics and presentation of the site.
898173_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale.
898173_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas.
898173_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.
898173_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Products and Purchasing Our stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks.
898173_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	We do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations.
898173_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, BWD, Cardone, Castrol, Gates Rubber, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Quaker State, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix.
898173_11_ITEM1_P37_S3	In addition to name brand products, our stores carry a wide variety of high-quality private label products under our BestTest , BrakeBest , Master Pro , Micro-Gard , Murray and Omnispark , O Reilly Auto Parts , Power Torque , Super Start , and Ultima proprietary name brands.
898173_11_ITEM1_P37_S4	Our private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value a characteristic important to our DIY customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P37_S5	We have added O Reilly branded chemicals and commodities as well as proprietary private label products to all acquired CSK stores.
898173_11_ITEM1_P37_S6	These stores have also undergone hard-part resets, which significantly increased their hard-part SKU offering, giving our customers in all stores a good, better, and best product offering.
898173_11_ITEM1_P37_S7	We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500 vendors, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 22% of our total purchases in 2010.
898173_11_ITEM1_P37_S8	Our largest vendor in 2010 accounted for approximately seven percent of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for approximately three to five percent of such purchases.
898173_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	long-term contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts.
898173_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	We believe that alternative supply sources exist at substantially similar costs, for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell.
898173_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors.
898173_11_ITEM1_P38_S3	During 2010, we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases.
898173_11_ITEM1_P38_S4	As a whole, we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good.
898173_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Pricing We believe that a competitive pricing policy is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business.
898173_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	Product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing policies of competitors in the market area served by each store.
898173_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	Most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of competitor price comparisons and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at a discount to the manufacturer s suggested retail price with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing.
898173_11_ITEM1_P39_S3	Consistent with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any in-stock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area.
898173_11_ITEM1_P39_S4	We have repositioned the product offering and pricing in all CSK stores to an every-day low price strategy to ensure we are competitive in every market.
898173_11_ITEM1_P39_S5	We believe competitive pricing is needed to grow our market share and maintain a customer s repeat business, and we believe strongly that this strategy is more sustainable, requires less promotional spending and will produce better results than CSK s historical promotional-based, high-low pricing strategy.
898173_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Professional Parts People We believe our highly trained team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	Because a significant portion of our business is from professional service providers, our Professional Parts People are required to be technically proficient in automotive products.
898173_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from a Professional Parts Person, particularly when purchasing hard parts.
898173_11_ITEM1_P40_S3	The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.
898173_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	We screen prospective team members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs, or automotive aptitude.
898173_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	New store team members go through a comprehensive orientation about the culture of our company as well as the requirements for their specific job position.
898173_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P41_S3	Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O Reilly Certified Parts Professional test.
898173_11_ITEM1_P41_S4	Passing the O Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE).
898173_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	All of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	For this reason, select team members in each store complete extensive sales call training with their regional field sales manager.
898173_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	Afterward, these team members spend one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P42_S3	Additionally, each team member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.
898173_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Customer Service We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products.
898173_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	We believe that the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the specific automotive products requested.
898173_11_ITEM1_P43_S2	Accordingly, each O Reilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications.
898173_11_ITEM1_P43_S3	We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in our stores, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.
898173_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	Marketing Marketing to the DIY Customer - We use an integrated marketing program, which includes television, radio, direct mail and newspaper distribution, in-store and online promotions, and sports and event sponsorships, to aggressively attract DIY customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	The marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to an increase in awareness of the O Reilly brand across our geographic footprint.
898173_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	We utilize a combination of brand and product/price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases, which frequently coincide with key sales events.
898173_11_ITEM1_P44_S3	During 2010, we continued to co-brand all forms of advertising in the markets containing acquired CSK stores.
898173_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	but to also allow for a smoother transition throughout the rebranding process.
898173_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	Store signage in substantially all acquired CSK stores is expected to be changed to the O Reilly Brand by the end of the first quarter of 2011, and we expect to end the co-branding of all forms of advertising during 2011.
898173_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	To stimulate sales among race enthusiasts, who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public, during 2010 we sponsored multiple nationally-televised races and over 1,500 grassroots, local, and regional motorsports events throughout 38 states.
898173_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	We maintained our partnership with the National Association for Stock Car Racing ( NASCAR ) as the Official Auto Parts Store of NASCAR and were the title sponsor of five National Hot Rod Association ( NHRA ) races from Pomona, California to Charlotte, North Carolina.
898173_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	During the fall and winter months, we strategically sponsor National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) football and basketball and the National Football League ( NFL ).
898173_11_ITEM1_P46_S3	Our relationships with over 70 NCAA teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently-displayed O Reilly logos on TV-visible scoring table signs throughout the season.
898173_11_ITEM1_P46_S4	In addition, O Reilly Auto Parts radio advertising can be heard during more than 350 NFL games due to our sponsorship of nearly 20 teams.
898173_11_ITEM1_P46_S5	Through an expanded use of Spanish language radio, print, and outdoor, as well as sponsorships of over 45 local and regional festivals and events, we demonstrated our commitment to increasing marketing efforts that are targeted toward the Hispanic auto parts consumer.
898173_11_ITEM1_P46_S6	In 2010, we continued our dedicated problem/solution communication strategy, which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance as a way to save money and protect their automotive investment over the long term.
898173_11_ITEM1_P46_S7	This highly relevant message resonates with consumers and establishes O Reilly as their source for the parts they need and excellent customer service.
898173_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	Marketing to the Professional Service Provider - We have over 450 full-time O Reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas.
898173_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	Each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon, selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	Targeted marketing materials such as flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers, paint and body shops and fleet customers.
898173_11_ITEM1_P47_S3	Our industry leading First Call program enables our sales representatives, district managers, and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services bulleted below:
898173_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	the Certified Auto Repair Center Program, a program that provides professional service providers with business tools they can utilize to profitably grow and market their shops.
898173_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	Marketing to the Independently Owned Parts Store - Along with the daily operation and management of the DCs and the distribution of automotive products to our stores, Ozark Automotive Distributors, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary ( Ozark ), also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores ( jobber stores ) throughout our trade areas.
898173_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	These jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an O Reilly store.
898173_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	Ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores.
898173_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	Approximately 185 jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from Ozark and participate in our Parts City Auto Parts program, our proprietary jobber service program.
898173_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	As a participant in these programs, a jobber store, which meets certain financial and operational standards, is permitted to indicate its Parts City Auto Parts membership through the display of the respective logo that is owned by Ozark.
898173_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	In return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from Ozark, we provide computer software for business management, competitive pricing, advertising, marketing and sales assistance to Parts City Auto Parts affiliate stores.
898173_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	Competition We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.
898173_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	We compete primarily with the stores bulleted below:
898173_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts, maintenance items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.).
898173_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, price, helpfulness of store personnel, store layout and convenient and accessible store locations.
898173_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	Distribution System Support We currently operate 23 DCs comprised of approximately 8.5 million operating square feet (see the Properties table in Item 2 of this Form 10-K for a detailed listing of DC operating square footages).
898173_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our DCs are equipped with highly automated material handling equipment, which efficiently expedite the movement of our products from the shelves to the loading areas for shipment to each of our stores on a nightly basis.
898173_11_ITEM1_P53_S2	The DCs utilize technology to electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores.
898173_11_ITEM1_P53_S3	In addition to the bar code system employed in our stores, each of our stores is connected through secured data transmission technology to our DCs and corporate headquarters.
898173_11_ITEM1_P53_S4	We believe that our distribution system provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory.
898173_11_ITEM1_P53_S5	Moreover, we believe that our ongoing, significant capital investments made to expand the network of DCs allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network.
898173_11_ITEM1_P53_S6	Our DC expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores located in the regions surrounding each DC.
898173_11_ITEM1_P53_S7	We currently have a total growth capacity of approximately 650 stores in our distribution network.
898173_11_ITEM1_P53_S8	As part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2011 we plan to:
898173_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	make proven, ROI based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs including conveyor systems, picking modules and lift equipment.

898173_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	We believe that our business is not otherwise dependent upon any patent, trademark, service mark or copyright.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forward-looking statements.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In recent years, worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions, including the United States, and such conditions may worsen in the foreseeable future.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Many of these factors are outside of our control.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our customers purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Also, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S7	If third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S8	We cannot assure that the recently integrated CSK stores will perform at the same desired level of profitability as historic O Reilly stores.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S9	We expect acquired CSK stores to approximate the profitability levels of our core O Reilly stores, and believe this to be a significant factor in achieving our financial goals.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S10	The failure of these stores to attain these profitability levels could seriously impact our forecasted results of operations.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Our ability to operate these stores at our expected level will depend, in part, on the successful preservation of the existing DIY customers already established in these markets, growing the commercial customer base, the adoption of the O Reilly culture, along with maintaining employee morale and the retention of key personnel.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S12	We may not be able to obtain these profitability levels in our acquired CSK stores as soon as we expect, or at all.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S13	If we fail to address the challenges of our new markets effectively, our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected, and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the merger.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S14	Our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S15	We have in place, an unsecured credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P2_S16	For example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things:
898173_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	expose us to fluctuations in interest rates.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative and negative covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	A downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We currently have a BBB- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard Poor s and a Baa3 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody s Investors Service.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The evaluations are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at a specific rate.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	A downgrade in our current credit rating from both agencies would adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P5_S5	A downgrade could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our notes, preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P5_S7	We expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following:
898173_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, as a successor owner or operator, may be liable.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Both the DIY and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than us, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P6_S6	For a list of our principal competitors, see the Competition section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient, and as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S7	For a discussion of our management, see the Business section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K. We cannot assure future growth will be achieved.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S8	We believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S9	Our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S10	We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2011 and beyond will be achieved.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S11	Failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S12	For a discussion of our growth strategies, see the Growth Strategy section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K. We are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our costs and sales.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S13	Approximately 29% of our stores are located in Texas and California.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P7_S14	Therefore, our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of those regions.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to DIY customers.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, our stores located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Legal proceedings and related matters arising from CSK could adversely affect us.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	As discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 14 Legal Matters to the consolidated financial statements, several of CSK s former officers and employees were charged by the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and named in civil actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
898173_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Reilly and the DOJ have agreed in principle, subject to final documentation, to resolve CSK s pre-acquisition issues with the DOJ.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The pre-acquisition SEC investigation of CSK, which commenced in 2006, was settled in May of 2009 by administrative order without fines, disgorgement or other financial remedies.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Under Delaware law, the charter documents of the CSK entities and certain indemnification agreements, CSK has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and, as a result, O Reilly is currently incurring legal fees on the behalf of these persons in relation to certain matters.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	There can be no assurance that the expenses incurred in connection with the resolution of these matters will be covered by CSK s directors and officers insurance policies.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If we incur significant uninsured expenses in connection with the resolution of the matters described above, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S4	All of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We cannot predict the effect, if any, which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Risks related to the Company and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, could affect the Company s stock price.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S8	We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of the future operating results of the Company and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S9	If our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S10	We cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of CSK will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S11	If we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our business would likely suffer.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S12	The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S13	The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S14	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S15	Failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P10_S16	In addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	A change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P12_S5	For example, financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P12_S6	In addition, the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors, and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Complications in our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise may affect our business.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We operate 23 distribution centers ( DC ) nationwide to support our business.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If complications arise with any facility or if any facility is severely damaged or destroyed, our other DCs may not be able to fully support the resulting additional distribution demands.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	This may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a nightly basis and therefore affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Environmental legislation and regulations could affect our operations, such as by increasing fuel prices, and therefore increase our operating costs.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, which could adversely impact all industries.
898173_11_ITEM1A_P13_S7	While it is uncertain whether these will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming, and these mandates, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, including, among other things, increasing fuel prices.
898173_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	provides certain information regarding our administrative offices and distribution centers ( DC ) as of December 31, 2010:

898173_11_ITEM2_P15_S0	(o) Occupied under the terms of a lease expiring October 31, 2012, with an unaffiliated party, not subject to renewal.
898173_11_ITEM2_P16_S0	(p) Occupied under the terms of a lease expiring August 31, 2024, with an unaffiliated party, subject to renewal for four five-year terms at our option.
898173_11_ITEM2_P16_S1	Of the 3,570 stores that we operated at December 31, 2010, 1,172 stores were owned, 2,328 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 70 stores were leased from one of four entities owned by O Reilly family members.
898173_11_ITEM2_P16_S2	Leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of, at a minimum, 10 years, subject to one or more renewals at our option.
898173_11_ITEM2_P16_S3	We have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby.
898173_11_ITEM2_P16_S4	Such master lease agreements with two of the three O Reilly family entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores.
898173_11_ITEM2_P16_S5	The master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from March 31, 2011, to December 31, 2029.
898173_11_ITEM2_P16_S6	We believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.
898173_11_ITEM2_P16_S7	We believe that our present facilities are in good condition, are adequately insured and adequate for the conduct of our current operations.
898173_11_ITEM2_P16_S8	The store servicing capability of our 23 existing DCs is approximately 4,250 stores, providing a growth capacity for over 680 stores.
898173_11_ITEM2_P16_S9	We believe this growth capacity will provide us with the DC infrastructure needed for near term expansion without the need for additional DC facilities.
898173_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	O Reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company s business.
898173_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, it does not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters, taking into account applicable insurance and reserves, will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.
898173_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	In addition, O Reilly is involved in resolving the governmental investigations that were being conducted against CSK and CSK s former officers prior to its acquisition by O Reilly Automotive, Inc. as described below.
898173_11_ITEM3_P0_S3	CSK Pre-Acquisition Matters Governmental Investigations and Actions: As previously reported, the pre-acquisition Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) investigation of CSK, which commenced in 2006, was settled in May of 2009 by administrative order without fines, disgorgement or other financial remedies.
898173_11_ITEM3_P0_S4	The Department of Justice ( DOJ ) s criminal investigation into these same matters as previously disclosed is near a conclusion and is described more fully below.
898173_11_ITEM3_P0_S5	In addition, the previously reported SEC complaint against three (3) former employees of CSK for alleged conduct related to CSK s historical accounting practices remains ongoing.
898173_11_ITEM3_P0_S6	The action filed by the SEC on July 22, 2009, against Maynard L. Jenkins, the former Chief Executive Officer of CSK seeking reimbursement from Mr. Jenkins of certain bonuses and stock sale profits pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as previously reported, also continues.
898173_11_ITEM3_P0_S7	The previously reported DOJ criminal prosecution of Don Watson, the former Chief Financial Officer of CSK, remains ongoing with trial set to commence on or about June 7, 2011.
898173_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	With respect to the ongoing DOJ investigation into CSK s pre-acquisition accounting practices as referenced above, as previously disclosed, O Reilly and the DOJ agreed in principle, subject to final documentation, to resolve the DOJ investigation of CSK s legacy pre-acquisition accounting practices.
898173_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company and the DOJ continue work to complete the final documentation necessary for the execution of the Non-Prosecution Agreement previously referenced and payment of the one-time monetary penalty of $20.9 million, also previously reported.
898173_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	The Company s total reserve related to the DOJ investigation of CSK was $21.4 million as of December 31, 2010, which relates to the amount of the monetary penalty and associated legal costs.
898173_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	Notwithstanding the agreement in principle with the DOJ, several of CSK s former directors or officers and current or former employees have been or may be interviewed or deposed as part of criminal, administrative and civil investigations and lawsuits.
898173_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	As described above, certain former employees of CSK are the subject of civil and criminal litigation commenced by the government.
898173_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	Under Delaware law, the charter documents of the CSK entities and certain indemnification agreements, CSK has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and, as a result, O Reilly is currently incurring legal fees on behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters.
898173_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	Some of these indemnification obligations and other related costs may not be covered by CSK s insurance policies.
898173_11_ITEM3_P3_S3	As a result of the CSK acquisition, O Reilly expects to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to the indemnity obligations related to the litigation that has commenced by the DOJ and SEC of CSK s former employees.
898173_11_ITEM3_P3_S4	Reilly has a remaining reserve, with respect to such indemnification obligations, of $18.8 million as of December 31, 2010, which was primarily recorded as an assumed liability in the Company s allocation of the purchase price of CSK.
898173_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	The foregoing governmental investigations and indemnification matters are subject to many uncertainties, and, given their complexity and scope, their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time.
898173_11_ITEM3_P4_S1	It is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the Company s results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of such matters, depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flows for such period.
898173_11_ITEM3_P4_S2	However, at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of all of such regulatory proceedings and other matters that are pending, after consideration of applicable reserves and potentially available insurance coverage benefits not contemplated in recorded reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
898173_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company s stock is traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ( Nasdaq ) under the symbol ORLY .
898173_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	As of February 21, 2011, O Reilly Automotive, Inc. had approximately 86,000 shareholders based on the number of holders of record and an estimate of individual participants represented by security position listings.
898173_11_ITEM5_P0_S2	The Company s common stock began trading on April 22, 1993; no cash dividends have been declared since that time, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
898173_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	The prices in the following table represent the high and low sales price for O Reilly Automotive, Inc.
898173_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	common stock as reported by Nasdaq.
898173_11_ITEM5_P1_S2	During fiscal 2010, the Company made no purchases or repurchases of its common stock.
898173_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	below compares the Company s selected financial data over a ten-year period.
898173_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	In 2001, 2005 and 2008, the Company acquired Mid-State Automotive Distributors, Midwest Auto Parts Distributors and CSK Auto Corporation, respectively.
898173_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	The 2001 Mid-State acquisition added 82 stores, the 2005 Midwest acquisition added 72 stores and the 2008 CSK acquisition added 1,342 stores to the O Reilly store count.
898173_11_ITEM6_P1_S2	Financial results for these acquired companies have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the dates of the acquisitions forward.
898173_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	(a) The cumulative change in accounting method, effective January 1, 2004, changed the method of applying last-in, first-out accounting policy for certain inventory costs.
898173_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	Under the new method, included in the value of inventory are certain procurement, warehousing and distribution center costs.
898173_11_ITEM6_P2_S2	The previous method was to recognize those costs as incurred, reported as a component of costs of goods sold.
898173_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	(b) The pro forma income statement reflects the retroactive application of the cumulative effect of the accounting change to historical periods.
898173_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	(a) Store count for 2002 does not include 27 stores acquired from Dick Smith Enterprises and Davie Automotive, Inc. in December 2002.
898173_11_ITEM6_P5_S0	(b) Total square footage includes normal selling, office, stockroom and receiving space.
898173_11_ITEM6_P6_S0	Sales per weighted-average store and square foot are weighted to consider the approximate dates of store openings or expansions.
898173_11_ITEM6_P7_S0	(c) Same-store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year.
898173_11_ITEM6_P7_S1	Percentage increase in same-store sales is calculated based on store sales results, which exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales by outside salesmen, sales to team members and sales during the one to two week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion.
898173_11_ITEM6_P8_S0	(d) Same-store sales for 2008 include sales for stores acquired in the CSK acquisition.
898173_11_ITEM6_P8_S1	Comparable stores sales for stores operating on O Reilly systems open at least one year increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008.
898173_11_ITEM6_P8_S2	Comparable stores sales for stores operating on the legacy CSK system open at least one year decreased 1.7% for the portion of CSK s sales in 2008 since the July 11, 2008, acquisition.
898173_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	In Management s Discussion and Analysis, we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results, including:
898173_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	new accounting standards that affect our company.
898173_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	The review of Management s Discussion and Analysis should be made in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report.
898173_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We claim the protection of the safe-harbor for forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
898173_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as expect, believe, anticipate, should, plan, intend, estimate, project, will or similar words.
898173_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	In addition, statements contained within this annual report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, such as statements discussing among other things, expected growth, store development, CSK Auto Corporation ( CSK ) Department of Justice ( DOJ ) investigation resolution, integration and expansion strategy, business strategies, future revenues and future performance.
898173_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events and results.
898173_11_ITEM7_P2_S4	Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, competition, product demand, the market for auto parts, the economy in general, inflation, consumer debt levels, governmental approvals, our ability to hire and retain qualified employees, risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses including the acquisition and integration of CSK, weather, terrorist activities, war and the threat of war.
898173_11_ITEM7_P2_S5	Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results described or implied in these forward-looking statements.
898173_11_ITEM7_P2_S6	Please refer to the Risk Factors section of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, for additional factors that could materially affect our financial performance.
898173_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States.
898173_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and professional service providers.
898173_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment.
898173_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we operated 3,570 stores in 38 states.
898173_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Operating within the retail industry, we, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits and competition.
898173_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact our Company and the retail sector in general.
898173_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	We cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change.
898173_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	We believe that the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, average vehicle age, new light vehicle sales, unperformed maintenance, unemployment and product quality differentiation are key drivers of current and future demand of products sold within the automotive aftermarket.
898173_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Number of miles driven: Total miles driven in the U.S., along with changes in the average age of vehicles on the road, heavily influence the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell.
898173_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Historically, the long-term trend in the total miles driven in the U.S. has steadily increased.
898173_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	According to the Department of Transportation, between 1999 and 2007, the total number of miles driven in the U.S. increased at an average annual rate of approximately 1.6%.
898173_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	In 2008, however, difficult macroeconomic conditions and record high gas prices during the first half of the year led to a decrease in the number of miles driven and in 2009, miles driven remained relatively flat.
898173_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	Through November of 2010, miles driven in the U.S. increased by 0.7% with miles driven increasing each month since March.
898173_11_ITEM7_P6_S4	As the U.S. economy recovers, we believe that annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to increase the demand for our products.
898173_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Number of U.S. registered vehicles and new light vehicle sales: As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ), the total number of vehicles on the road in the U.S. has exhibited steady growth over the past decade, with the total number of registered vehicles increasing 18%, from 205 million light vehicles in 2000 to 242 million in 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	New light vehicle sales, however, have declined over the past decade.
898173_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	Between 2000 and 2007, new car sales in the U.S. decreased by 7%, from 17.4 million in 2000 to 16.2 million vehicles in 2007.
898173_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	Due to the recent difficult macroeconomic environment in the U.S., new light vehicles sales declined by 18% in 2008 to 13.2 million and declined by 21% in 2009 to 10.4 million vehicles, which is the lowest level in the past decade.
898173_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	Based on the current economic environment, we believe new light vehicle sales will remain below historic levels and consumers will continue to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher miles, continuing the trend of an aging vehicle population.
898173_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Average vehicle age of registered vehicles: As reported by the AAIA, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased over the past decade from 9.1 years for passenger cars and 8.5 years for light trucks in 1999 to 10.6 and 9.6 years in 2009, respectively.
898173_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and built vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains, and interiors and exteriors, the decrease in new car sales over the past two years and the consumers willingness to invest in maintaining their higher-mileage, better built vehicles.
898173_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of manufacturer warranty.
898173_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for our products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures which require replacement parts and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles would require.
898173_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	According to estimates compiled by the Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association, the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the U.S. totaled $54 billion for 2009 versus $50 billion for 2008.
898173_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	This metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed.
898173_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products, and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand.
898173_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	We believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions beginning in 2008 contributed to the increased amount of unperformed maintenance in 2009; however, with the reduced number of new car sales and consumers increased focus on maintaining their current vehicle with the expectation of keeping the vehicle longer than they would have in a better macroeconomic environment, we believe the amount of underperformed maintenance decreased in 2010, resulting in a strong year in the automotive aftermarket.
898173_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Unemployment: Challenging macroeconomic conditions have lead to high levels of unemployment.
898173_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Monthly U.S. unemployment rates for 2010 ranged from 9.4% to 9.9%.
898173_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	We believe that these unemployment rates and continued uncertainty in the overall economic health have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending.
898173_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	We also believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money and can be an important factor in the consumer s decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle.
898173_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	While the deferral of vehicle purchases has lead to an increase in vehicle maintenance, long term trends of high unemployment levels could reduce the number of total annual miles driven as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending habits, both of which could negatively impact our business.
898173_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Product quality differentiation: We provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer.
898173_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good , better , and best alternatives.
898173_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products.
898173_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	Consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry.
898173_11_ITEM7_P12_S4	We believe that the average consumer s tendency has been to trade-down to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions.
898173_11_ITEM7_P12_S5	We have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers.
898173_11_ITEM7_P12_S6	KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant effect on our operations and are summarized below:
898173_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Since July 11, 2008, and as a result of the CSK acquisition, we have incurred and may continue to incur legal fees related to ongoing governmental investigations and indemnity obligations for the litigation that has commenced against CSK and former CSK employees.
898173_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	O Reilly and the DOJ have now agreed in principle, subject to final documentation, to resolve the DOJ investigation of CSK s legacy accounting practices.
898173_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	Based upon the agreement in principle for a final settlement, we have recorded a charge of $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, in anticipation of the DOJ, CSK and O Reilly executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement.
898173_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	On July 11, 2008, we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of 6 3 / 4 % Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the Notes ) originally issued by CSK.
898173_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Notes were exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock.
898173_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	The Notes bore interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.5% until maturity.
898173_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	During 2010, all holders of the Notes exercised their right to exchange and on December 21, 2010, the Notes were retired.
898173_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	In March of 2010, the President of the United States of America signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Acts ).
898173_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	The provisions of the Acts are not expected to have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements in the short-term.
898173_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	However, the potential long-term impacts of the Acts to our business and consolidated financial statements, while currently uncertain, are being evaluated by management.
898173_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	We will continue to assess how the Acts apply to us, their effect on our business and how we plan to best meet the stated requirements.
898173_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	On December 29, 2010, we completed a corporate reorganization creating a holding company structure (the Reorganization ).
898173_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Reorganization was implemented through an agreement and plan of merger under Section 351.448 of The General Corporation Law of the State of Missouri which did not require a vote of the shareholders.
898173_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result of the Reorganization, the previous parent company and registrant O Reilly Automotive, Inc. ( Old O Reilly ) was renamed O Reilly Automotive Stores, Inc. and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent company and registrant, which was renamed O Reilly Automotive, Inc.
898173_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	On January 11, 2011, we announced a new Board-approved share repurchase program (the Repurchase Program ) that authorizes us to repurchase up to $500 million of shares of our common stock over a three-year period.
898173_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	Stock repurchases under the Repurchase Program may be made from time to time as we deem appropriate, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, and we may increase or otherwise modify the Repurchase Program at any time without prior notice.
898173_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
898173_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	2010 Compared to 2009 Sales: Sales increased $550 million, or 11%, from $4.85 billion in 2009 to $5.4 billion in 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 (in millions):
898173_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to team members and sales during the one- to two-week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion.
898173_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Comparable store sales increased 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2010, versus 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	We believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers.
898173_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	The improvement in comparable store sales for the year was driven both by increased transaction counts and higher average ticket values.
898173_11_ITEM7_P20_S4	We believe that the increase in transaction counts is a result of the customer s focus on better maintaining their current vehicles, the stabilization of the economy and gas prices during the year and the growth of our commercial business in the acquired CSK markets.
898173_11_ITEM7_P20_S5	The improvement in average ticket value is primarily the result of a larger percentage of our total sales derived from higher priced hard parts categories.
898173_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Store growth: At December 31, 2010, we operated 3,570 stores compared to 3,421 stores at December 31, 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 170 net new stores in 2011 versus 149 net new stores in 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	Gross profit increased $294 million, or 13%, from $2.33 billion (48.0% of sales) in 2009 to $2.62 billion (48.6% of sales) in 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores.
898173_11_ITEM7_P21_S4	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was the result of improved product mix, lower product acquisition costs and decreased inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percent of the total sales mix and reduced leverage on the expanded number of distribution centers.
898173_11_ITEM7_P21_S5	The improvement in product mix is primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a higher gross margin percentage than other categories.
898173_11_ITEM7_P21_S6	Increasing hard part sales are the result of strong consumer demand as consumers retain their vehicles longer and our enhanced and more comprehensive inventory levels in the hard part categories in the CSK stores, supported by a more extensive and robust distribution network.
898173_11_ITEM7_P21_S7	Lower product acquisition costs are derived from improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as the result of large purchase volume increases associated with the acquisition of CSK.
898173_11_ITEM7_P21_S8	The benefit of this improvement in gross margin was realized in the first and second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same periods in 2009 when we renegotiated these vendor contracts.
898173_11_ITEM7_P21_S9	Our gross margin results for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 reflect comparable periods of improved purchasing leverage.
898173_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	The decrease in inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores is the result of the more robust O Reilly point of sale system ( POS ), which was installed in all CSK stores when they converted to the O Reilly distribution systems.
898173_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	The O Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory resulting in improved inventory shrinkage.
898173_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	Commercial sales are growing at a faster rate than DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in our western markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy in these areas.
898173_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross margin percentage than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional customers, and create pressure on our gross margin as a percent of sales.
898173_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The reduced leverage on distribution center costs is the result of the additional distribution centers, which have been opened in conjunction with the CSK integration plan.
898173_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	New team members in these distribution centers are not yet fully proficient with distribution operations, resulting in inefficiencies.
898173_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	negotiating leverage with our vendors will allow us to generate gross margins at levels comparable to our 2010 full year results going forward, however continued growth in our commercial sales, as a percent of the total sales mix, will continue to pressure our gross margin results in the future.
898173_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: SG A increased approximately $100 million, or 6%, from $1.79 billion (36.9% of sales) in 2009 to $1.89 billion (35.0% of sales) in 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars is primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count and dual market strategy in the acquired CSK stores, as well as increased incentive compensation for team members resulting from strong comparable store sales.
898173_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased leverage of fixed costs on very strong comparable store sales levels.
898173_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Operating income: Operating income increased $175 million, or 33%, from $538 million (11.1% of sales) in 2009 to $713 million (13.2% of sales) in 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in operating income is the result of increased sales and gross profit, offset by the increased SG A discussed above as well as a $21 million charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation of CSK as discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 14 Legal Matters to the consolidated financial statements.
898173_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG A costs from strong comparable store sales.
898173_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	This full-year operating income as a percentage of sales represents a record high for the Company, and we would anticipate these operating levels to be sustainable.
898173_11_ITEM7_P26_S4	Other income and expense: Interest expense decreased $6 million, from $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) in 2009 to $39 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P26_S5	The decrease in interest expense during 2010 as compared to 2009 is the result of a lower level of average outstanding borrowings under our secured asset-backed credit facility ( Credit Facility ).
898173_11_ITEM7_P26_S6	Included as a component of Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010, is a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK.
898173_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes increased $81 million from $189 million (38.1% effective tax rate) in 2009 to $270 million (39.2% effective tax rate) in 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes is due to the increase in our taxable income.
898173_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	The increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation of $21 million which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
898173_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income increased $112 million, or 36%, from $307 million (6.3% of sales) in 2009 to $419 million (7.8% of sales) in 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 32% to $2.95 on 142 million shares compared to $2.23 for the year ended December 31, 2009, on 138 million shares.
898173_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our year-to-date results include a nonrecurring charge related to the ongoing, legacy DOJ investigation of CSK as well as a nonrecurring, non-operating gain in other income related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired from CSK.
898173_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of the charge related to the DOJ investigation of CSK, increased 37% to $734 million (13.6% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $538 million (11.1% of sales) for the same period in 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P28_S4	Adjusted net income, excluding the impact of the charge related to the DOJ investigation of CSK and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable increased 41% to $433 million (8.0% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $307 million (6.3% of sales) for the same period in 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P28_S5	Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, excluding the impact of the charge related to the DOJ investigation of CSK and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable, increased 37% to $3.05 for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $2.23 for the same period in 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	The table below outlines the impact of the charge and the gain for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009 (amounts in thousands, except per share data):
898173_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The financial information presented in the table above is not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
898173_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	These items include adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
898173_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the CSK DOJ investigation charge and the gain on the settlement of the CSK note receivable provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P30_S4	We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_11_ITEM7_P30_S5	The material limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that such measures are not reflective of actual GAAP amounts.
898173_11_ITEM7_P30_S6	We compensate for this limitation by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Compared to 2008 Sales: Sales increased $1.27 billion, or 36%, from $3.58 billion in 2008 to $4.85 billion in 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 (in millions):
898173_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to team members and sales during the one-to-two week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion.
898173_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Comparable store sales for stores operating on the O Reilly systems increased 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	stores sales from the 141 converted Murray s stores.
898173_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Comparable store sales for stores operating on the legacy CSK system increased 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Consolidated comparable store sales increased 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009, versus 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008.
898173_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	We believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers.
898173_11_ITEM7_P33_S4	The improvement in comparable store sales was primarily driven by an increase in transaction counts, while average ticket remained flat with the prior year.
898173_11_ITEM7_P33_S5	The flat average ticket value was attributable to more complex and costly repair parts, consistent with ongoing industry trends offset by competitive price reductions in the acquired CSK stores and the addition of a wider assortment of entry level products in those stores.
898173_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Store growth: We opened 149 new O Reilly branded stores and one new Schuck s store in 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	At December 31, 2009, we operated 3,421 stores compared to 3,285 stores at December 31, 2008.
898173_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	Due to the acquisition and integration of CSK, we anticipate new store unit growth to be limited to 150 new stores in 2010, excluding the previously disclosed consolidation and closure of underperforming stores related to the acquisition of CSK; however, we anticipate that continued store unit growth consistent with our historical openings will continue in the future.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Gross profit increased $699 million, or 43%, from $1.63 billion (45.5% of sales) in 2008 to $2.33 billion (48.0% of sales) in 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2009 versus roughly one half of a year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2008, the increase in sales from new stores and an increase in comparable store sales from existing stores.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of lower product acquisition cost, changes in our product mix, distribution system improvements and a favorable pricing environment on certain commodity based products.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	Product acquisition costs improved primarily due to continued negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth related to the acquisition of CSK.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S4	We anticipate continued improvements in product acquisition costs at a moderate rate in 2010 from a full year of the benefit from improved leverage with our vendors as we anniversary product line changeovers in the acquired CSK stores throughout the year.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S5	We improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store s market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S6	Additionally, gross margin percentage improved as a result of an increased percentage of our total sales mix to DIY customers.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S7	Prior to the acquisition of CSK, our mix of sales to DIY customers was approximately equal to sales to professional service provider customers.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S8	At the time of the acquisition in July of 2008, acquired CSK stores generated more than 90% of their total sales from DIY customers.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S9	The addition of the acquired CSK stores predominantly retail sales has resulted in a mix shift of our consolidated sales to approximately 65% DIY and 35% professional service provider.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S10	In 2009, core O Reilly stores derived approximately 53% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 47% from our professional service provider customers, while acquired CSK stores derived approximately 84% of sales from our DIY customers and approximately 16% from our professional service provider customers.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S11	Sales to DIY customers generally have higher gross margin percentages than sales to professional service providers as volume discounts are granted on these wholesale transactions to professional service providers.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S12	In addition, we have added our private label product lines to the acquired CSK stores inventory mix.
898173_11_ITEM7_P35_S13	Private label product sales generally offer better gross margin percentages than sales of corresponding branded products.
898173_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies.
898173_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	The reductions in commodity prices, without corresponding decreases in retail pricing, that we experienced in 2009 returned to more normal levels by the end of 2009 and we would not anticipate this favorable pricing environment to continue in 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	Additionally, in conjunction with the opening of our distribution centers ( DC ) in our western markets, we would anticipate a temporary decrease in distribution efficiencies as the new DC team members become proficient with the O Reilly distribution systems and as duplicative capacity is removed from the system.
898173_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Selling, general and administrative expense: SG A increased $497 million, or 38%, from $1.29 billion (36.1% of sales) in 2008 to $1.79 billion (36.9% of sales) in 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	The dollar increase in SG A expenses resulted from a full year inclusion of CSK and new stores.
898173_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	The increase in SG A expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to the addition of the acquired CSK stores, which have a higher expense structure than the core O Reilly store base, and the additional store payroll required to complete the ongoing product-line changeovers for acquired CSK stores.
898173_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	These increases were offset by a reduction in duplicative administrative corporate overhead as we continue to transition the CSK headquarters operations in Phoenix, Arizona to our facilities in Springfield, Missouri and increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the increase in comparable store sales.
898173_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Operating income: Operating income in 2009 increased $202 million, or 60%, from $336 million (or 9.4% of sales) in 2008 to $538 million (or 11.1% of sales) in 2009, representing an increase of 60%.
898173_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Interest expense: Interest expense increased $19 million, from $26 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2008 to $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) in 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	The increase in interest expense is the result of a full-year of borrowings under our Credit Facility in 2009 that was used to fund the acquisition of CSK in 2008, the opening of new stores, ongoing capital expenditures related to the integration of the operations of CSK, the expansion of our distribution infrastructure and the operation of our existing stores slightly offset by more favorable interest rates in 2009 on the non-swapped portion of the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility which are subject to variable interest rate changes.
898173_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time charges of $4 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the CSK acquisition and $7 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility.
898173_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes increased from $116 million in 2008 (38.4% effective tax rate) to $189 million in 2009 (38.1% effective tax rate).
898173_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The decrease in effective tax rate is the result of the one-time charge to adjust tax liabilities in 2008 relating to the CSK acquisition, offset by the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where CSK stores are located.
898173_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	The increase in the dollar amount for income taxes was due to the increase in income before income taxes.
898173_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income increased $121 million, or 65%, from $186 million in 2008 (5.2% of sales) to $307 million in 2009 (6.3% of sales).
898173_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased 51% to $2.23 on 138 million shares compared to $1.48 for the year ended December 31, 2008, on 125 million shares.
898173_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time and non-cash charges related to the July 11, 2008, acquisition of CSK.
898173_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	These charges included one-time costs for prepayment and extinguishment of our existing debt, commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility, a one-time adjustment to the tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of CSK, a one-time charge to conform the CSK team member vacation policy with the O Reilly policy and a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK s trade names and trademarks, which will be amortized over a period coinciding with the anticipated conversion of CSK store locations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our year ended December 31, 2009, results included a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK s trade names and trademarks.
898173_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges, increased 38% to $2.26 for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $1.64 for the same period one year ago.
898173_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	The table below outlines the impact of the acquisition related charges for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in thousands, except per share data):
898173_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	The acquisition-related adjustments to EPS in the above paragraph and table present certain financial information not derived in accordance with GAAP.
898173_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and earnings per share excluding acquisition-related charges provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company s ongoing core operations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	non-GAAP information is useful to gain an understanding of the recurring factors and trends affecting our business.
898173_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Material limitations of this non-GAAP measure are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts and amortization of acquisition-related trade names and trademarks reflect charges to net income and earnings per share that will recur over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from one to three years.
898173_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, as well as our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in millions):
898173_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	(1) Quick assets include cash, cash equivalents and receivables.
898173_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	(2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.
898173_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	(3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities.
898173_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	(4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities.
898173_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	(5) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total shareholders equity.
898173_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	(6) Adjusted debt is calculated as the sum of debt, letters of credit and six-times rent, less the premium on exchangeable notes.
898173_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	Adjusted EBITDAR is calculated as the sum of net income, interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, rent expense and stock option compensation expense, less the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation and the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of the CSK note receivable, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Liquidity and related ratios: Our working capital increased 6% from 2009 to 2010, primarily driven by an increased investment in hard parts inventories in the acquired CSK stores as we continue to grow and expand the professional service provider business in those markets as well as the additional net inventory investment required by our new store growth.
898173_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	Total debt decreased 55% and total equity increased 20% from 2009 to 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	The decrease in total debt was driven by strong cash flow from operations which allowed us to substantially pay down the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility.
898173_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	The increase in total equity was due to increased retained earnings resulting from strong net income in 2010 and an increase in additional paid-in capital, primarily from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefits as well as the impact of share based compensation.
898173_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $704 million in 2010, $285 million in 2009 and $299 million in 2008.
898173_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to an increase in net income (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, gain/loss on property and equipment, deferred income taxes and stock based compensation charges), a significant decrease in net inventory investment and an increase in other liabilities as compared to the same period in 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors.
898173_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	inventory availability in the acquired CSK stores.
898173_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Although our investment in net inventory decreased year over year in 2010, duplicative and excess inventory levels throughout our distribution network have lead to an increase in per store average inventory.
898173_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The average per-store inventory for our stores increased to $0.57 million as of December 31, 2010, from $0.56 million as of December 31, 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	The increase in other liabilities is principally due to the accrual of the CSK DOJ investigation charge during 2010 which is expected to be paid in 2011.
898173_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was principally due to an increase in net inventory investment in 2009 as discussed above, which was slightly offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses.
898173_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	The average per-store inventory for our stores increased to $0.56 million as of December 31, 2009, from $0.48 million as of December 31, 2008 as we made significant investments in the acquired CSK stores in 2009 to improve the inventory availability.
898173_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	During 2011, we will continue to refine the inventory levels in the acquired CSK stores and will focus on returning excess quantities to vendors where appropriate and selling through the remainder of the excess quantities on hand in the stores.
898173_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Investing activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $351 million in 2010, $411 million in 2009 and $368 million in 2008.
898173_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the integration of CSK and an increase in payments received on notes receivable.
898173_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	Capital expenditures were $365 million in 2010, $415 million in 2009, and $342 million in 2008.
898173_11_ITEM7_P57_S3	Capital expenditures related to the acquisition of CSK include the purchase of properties for DCs and costs associated with the conversion of CSK stores to the O Reilly Brand.
898173_11_ITEM7_P57_S4	Although we opened four new DCs in 2010, a significant portion of the capital expenditures for these DCs occurred in 2009 as we acquired property and began construction of the facilities.
898173_11_ITEM7_P57_S5	The increase in payments received on notes receivable was due to the one-time nonrecurring payment received to settle the note receivable acquired from CSK.
898173_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Increases in cash used in investing activities in both 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to the conversions of acquired CSK stores to the O Reilly Brand and the properties and facilities for the additional DCs.
898173_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	We opened 149 net new stores in 2010 and 150 net new stores in both 2009 and 2008.
898173_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	We plan to open 170 net new stores in 2011.
898173_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.4 million to $1.6 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.
898173_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Financing activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $350 million in 2010, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $121 million in 2009 and $53 million in 2008.
898173_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	Net cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 is driven by the increase in net repayments of outstanding borrowings on our long-term debt.
898173_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	The repayments in 2010 were funded by increased cash provided by operating activities as well as decreased capital expenditures compared to the same period in 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily the result of an increase in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our stock option plans and the associated tax benefit from the exercises.
898173_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Sources of liquidity: Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, to complete the conversions of the acquired CSK stores, expand distribution infrastructure and operate existing stores.
898173_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our Revolver.
898173_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our Revolver.
898173_11_ITEM7_P60_S4	We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolver will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
898173_11_ITEM7_P60_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels.
898173_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Credit facilities: On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year $1.2 billion secured credit facility arranged by BA (the Credit Facility ), which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined Company going forward.
898173_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	This Credit Facility replaced a previous unsecured, five-year syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of $100 million.
898173_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	The Credit Facility was comprised of a $1.075 billion tranche A revolving credit facility and a $125.0 million first-in-last-out revolving credit facility ( FILO tranche ).
898173_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	On the date of the transaction, the amount of the borrowing base available, as described in the credit agreement, under the Credit Facility was $1.05 billion of which we borrowed $588 million.
898173_11_ITEM7_P61_S4	We used borrowings under the Credit Facility to repay certain existing debt of CSK, repay our $75 million 2006-A Senior Notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility.
898173_11_ITEM7_P61_S5	The terms of the Credit Facility granted us the right to terminate the FILO tranche upon meeting certain requirements, including no events of default and aggregate projected availability under the Credit Facility.
898173_11_ITEM7_P61_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we elected to exercise our right to terminate the FILO tranche.
898173_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount of the borrowing base available under the Credit Facility was $1.071 billion and $1.196 billion, respectively, of which we had outstanding borrowings of $356 million and $679 million, respectively.
898173_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	The available borrowings under the Credit Facility were also reduced by stand-by letters of credit issued by us primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies.
898173_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	the Credit Facility was $644 million and $445 million, respectively.
898173_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	As part of the Credit Facility, we had pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral and we were subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant, with which we complied as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	At December 31, 2010, borrowings under the tranche A revolver bore interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 1.00% per annum or LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds.
898173_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	The base rate was equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by BA from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 0.50%.
898173_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	Fees related to unused capacity under the Credit Facility were assessed at a rate of 0.50% of the remaining available borrowings under the facility, subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity.
898173_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	In addition, we paid customary commitment fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the Credit Facility.
898173_11_ITEM7_P64_S4	All outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were repaid in conjunction with the issuance of our 2011 4.875% Senior Notes on January 14, 2011, as further discussed below.
898173_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver ) arranged by BA and Barclays, which matures in January of 2016.
898173_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	The Revolver includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings.
898173_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our ability to draw under the revolving facility is conditioned upon, among other things, our ability to certify that the representations and warranties contained in the credit agreement are true, correct and complete in all material respects and that no event of default has occurred or would result from the proposed extension of credit.
898173_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	Borrowings under the Revolver (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 1.325% to 2.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.325% to 1.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services.
898173_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	Swing line loans made under the Revolver bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above.
898173_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	In addition, we will pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.175% to 0.500% based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services.
898173_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Revolver replaced the secured Credit Facility we entered into on July 11, 2008.
898173_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	6 3 / 4 % Exchangeable Senior Notes: On July 11, 2008, we executed the Third Supplemental Indenture (the Third Supplemental Indenture ) to the 6 3 / 4 % Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the Notes ), in which we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of the Notes originally issued by CSK pursuant to an Indenture dated as of December 19, 2005, as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 30, 2005, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 27, 2006, by and between CSK Auto Corporation, CSK Auto, Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee.
898173_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	On December 31, 2008, and effective as of July 11, 2008, we entered into the Fourth Supplemental Indenture in order to correct the definition of Exchange Rate in the Third Supplemental Indenture.
898173_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	The Notes were exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock.
898173_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	The Notes bore interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.50% until maturity on December 15, 2025.
898173_11_ITEM7_P68_S4	Prior to their stated maturity, these Notes were exchangeable by the holder only under the following circumstances (as more fully described in the indenture under which the Notes were issued):
898173_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a change in control.
898173_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	On July 1, 2010, the Notes became exchangeable at the option of the holders and remained exchangeable through September 30, 2010, the last trading day of our third quarter, as provided for in the indentures governing the Notes.
898173_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	The Notes became exchangeable as our common stock closed at or above 130% of the Exchange Price (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes) for 20 trading days within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on June 30, 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	As a result, during the exchange period commencing July 1, 2010, and continuing through and including September 30, 2010, for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes held, holders of the Notes could, if they elected, surrender their Notes for exchange.
898173_11_ITEM7_P69_S4	If the Notes were exchanged, we would deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and, in the event our total exchange obligation exceeded the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged, shares of our common stock in respect of that excess.
898173_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	The total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each $1,000 in principal amount of the Notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of approximately 25.97 shares of our common stock and approximately $60.61 in cash.
898173_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	On September 28, 2010, certain holders of the Notes delivered notice to the exchange agent to exercise their right to exchange $11 million of the principal amount of the Notes.
898173_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Cash Settlement Averaging Period (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes) ended on October 27, 2010, and on October 29, 2010, we delivered $11 million in cash, which represented the principal amount of the Notes exchanged and the value of partial shares, and 92,855 shares of our common stock to the exchange agent in settlement of the exchange obligation.
898173_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	Concurrently, we retired the $11 million principal amount of the exchanged Notes.
898173_11_ITEM7_P71_S3	On October 1, 2010, the Notes again became exchangeable at the option of the holders and remained exchangeable through December 31, 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Noteholders had the option to require us to repurchase some or all of the Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on December 15, 2010; December 15, 2015; or December 15, 2020, or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture.
898173_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	We had the option to redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice.
898173_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	On November 15, 2010, we announced our intention to redeem the Notes on December 21, 2010, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date.
898173_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	On or prior to December 17, 2010, the remaining holders of the Notes delivered notice to the exchange agent to exercise their right to exchange the $89 million remaining principal amount of the Notes.
898173_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The Cash Settlement Averaging Period (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes) ended on December 16, 2010, and on December 21, 2010, we delivered $89 million in cash, which represented the principal amount of the Notes exchanged and the value of partial shares, and 939,312 shares of our common stock to the exchange agent in settlement of the exchange obligation.
898173_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	Concurrently, we retired the $89 million principal amount of the exchanged Notes.
898173_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 : On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes at a price to the public of 99.297% of their face value in the public market, of which certain of our subsidiaries are the guarantors, and UMB is trustee.
898173_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	The 2011 4.875% Senior Notes bear interest at 4.875% which is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, beginning on July 14, 2011.
898173_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	The 2011 4.875% Senior Notes mature on January 14, 2021.
898173_11_ITEM7_P74_S3	Proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our previous secured Credit Facility, to pay fees associated with the issuance and for general corporate purposes.
898173_11_ITEM7_P74_S4	Prior to October 14, 2020, the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, at our option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, equal to the greater of:
898173_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Yield (as defined in the indenture governing the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes) plus 25 basis points.
898173_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	On or after October 14, 2020, the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at our option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.
898173_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	In addition, if we undergo a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the indenture governing the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes), holders of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the repurchase date.
898173_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Debt covenants: The indenture governing the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indenture.
898173_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.
898173_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	The new Revolver contains certain positive and negative debt covenants.
898173_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	These covenants include limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the Revolver, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 times from the closing through December 31, 2012, 2.25 times through December 31, 2014, and 2.50 times through maturity and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times from the closing through maturity.
898173_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Our consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock option compensation expense ( EBITDAR ) to adjusted debt.
898173_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding standby letters of credit, six times capitalized rent and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt.
898173_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	As of January 14, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future.
898173_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Our adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio was 1.6 times and 2.4 times as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
898173_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	Under our current financing plan, we have a target adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 2.0 times to 2.25 times.
898173_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	The adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio discussed in the paragraph and presented in the table above is not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
898173_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	We do not, and nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the CSK DOJ investigation charge, the gain from the settlement of the note receivable, and the presentation of EBITDAR provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P80_S3	We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_11_ITEM7_P80_S4	Material limitations of this non-GAAP measure are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_11_ITEM7_P80_S5	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
898173_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	We have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost-effective alternative to our existing sources of cash.
898173_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	We do not believe, however, that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans.
898173_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	On December 29, 2000, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with an unrelated party.
898173_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	Under the terms of the transaction, we sold 90 properties, including land, buildings and improvements, which generated $52.3 million of cash.
898173_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	The lease, which is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional successive periods of five years each.
898173_11_ITEM7_P82_S3	The resulting gain of $4.5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term.
898173_11_ITEM7_P82_S4	Net rent expense during the initial term is approximately $5.3 million annually.
898173_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	In August 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback with O Reilly-Wooten, 2001 LLP (an entity owned by certain affiliates of the Company).
898173_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	The transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine O Reilly Auto Parts stores and generated approximately $5.6 million of cash.
898173_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss.
898173_11_ITEM7_P83_S3	The lease, which has been accounted for as an operating lease, calls for an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options.
898173_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	We issued stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Credit Facility that reduced our available borrowings.
898173_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	Those letters of credit were issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies.
898173_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit had a one-year term from the date of issuance.
898173_11_ITEM7_P84_S3	Letters of credit totaling $71.2 million and $72.3 million were outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
898173_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Deferred income taxes and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment s cancellation terms.
898173_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2011, which are included in Current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
898173_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, included commitments for future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are summarized in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 4 Long-Term Debt and Note 6 Commitments to the consolidated financial statements.
898173_11_ITEM7_P85_S3	We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolver.
898173_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	(1) At December 31, 2010, we had borrowings of $106 million under our secured Credit Facility, which were not covered under an interest rate swap agreement, with interest rates ranging from 2.31% to 4.25%.
898173_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	At December 31, 2009, we had borrowings of $279 million under our Credit Facility, which were not covered under an interest rate swap agreement, with interest rates ranging from 2.50% to 4.50%.
898173_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we incurred interest expense of $16 million and $23 million, respectively, as a result of borrowings under our secured Credit Facility, which were not covered under an interest rate swap agreement.
898173_11_ITEM7_P86_S3	See Note 4 Long-Term Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
898173_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	(2) On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million Revolver, which matures in January of 2016.
898173_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	Borrowings under the Revolver (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 1.325% to 2.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.325% to 1.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services.
898173_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	Swing line loans made under the Revolver bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above.
898173_11_ITEM7_P87_S3	In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.175% to 0.500% based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services.
898173_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Revolver replaced the secured Credit Facility.
898173_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	(4) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year.
898173_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments.
898173_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	(5) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits.
898173_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	These liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities, however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties.
898173_11_ITEM7_P90_S3	These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined.
898173_11_ITEM7_P90_S4	As of December 31, 2010, we recorded a liability of $41.3 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of Other liabilities .
898173_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management.
898173_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
898173_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates.
898173_11_ITEM7_P91_S3	Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP.
898173_11_ITEM7_P91_S4	However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.
898173_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Vendor concessions We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates.
898173_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory.
898173_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns.
898173_11_ITEM7_P93_S3	Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P93_S4	Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P93_S5	The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
898173_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and employee health care benefits.
898173_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	With the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities, which are limited by the design of these plans, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim.
898173_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities.
898173_11_ITEM7_P95_S3	Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains.
898173_11_ITEM7_P95_S4	As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information.
898173_11_ITEM7_P95_S5	These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value.
898173_11_ITEM7_P95_S6	These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_11_ITEM7_P95_S7	We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities.
898173_11_ITEM7_P95_S8	If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $10 million or 1.5% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business.
898173_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors.
898173_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	Actual results have consistently been within management s expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts.
898173_11_ITEM7_P96_S3	However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains.
898173_11_ITEM7_P96_S4	If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $0.8 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
898173_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve.
898173_11_ITEM7_P97_S2	We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit.
898173_11_ITEM7_P97_S3	The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings.
898173_11_ITEM7_P97_S4	Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented.
898173_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates.
898173_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position.
898173_11_ITEM7_P98_S3	While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority.
898173_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal.
898173_11_ITEM7_P99_S2	The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population.
898173_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand.
898173_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost.
898173_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods.
898173_11_ITEM7_P100_S3	Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances.
898173_11_ITEM7_P100_S4	We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future.
898173_11_ITEM7_P100_S5	We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink.
898173_11_ITEM7_P100_S6	We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and DCs.
898173_11_ITEM7_P100_S7	To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances.
898173_11_ITEM7_P100_S8	We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates.
898173_11_ITEM7_P100_S9	If unrecorded shrink changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $0.6 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred.
898173_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment.
898173_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset.
898173_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	The estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.
898173_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets.
898173_11_ITEM7_P104_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment.
898173_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	We review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually on December 31, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	We have not historically recorded an impairment to our goodwill or intangible assets.
898173_11_ITEM7_P105_S2	The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach.
898173_11_ITEM7_P105_S3	Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value.
898173_11_ITEM7_P105_S4	In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets is required as of December 31, 2010, nor do we believe goodwill or any other intangible assets are at risk of failing impairment testing.
898173_11_ITEM7_P105_S5	If the price of O Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine the Company s market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.
898173_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Closed Property Reserves We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income.
898173_11_ITEM7_P106_S2	The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms.
898173_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions.
898173_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates.
898173_11_ITEM7_P107_S2	Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known.
898173_11_ITEM7_P107_S3	If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	Legal Reserves We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O Reilly is currently involved.
898173_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations and litigation that are being conducted against CSK and certain of its former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date.
898173_11_ITEM7_P108_S2	As a result of the acquisition, we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations.
898173_11_ITEM7_P108_S3	Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK.
898173_11_ITEM7_P108_S4	Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures.
898173_11_ITEM7_P108_S5	If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $4.3 million or 0.6% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
898173_11_ITEM7_P109_S3	To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_11_ITEM7_P109_S4	While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2010 and 2009.
898173_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown.
898173_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.
898173_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	In January of 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ( ASU 2010-06 ).
898173_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	ASU 2010-06 amends Subtopic 820-10, requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements such as transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, as well as separate disclosures about activity relating to Level 3 measurements.
898173_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	ASU 2010-06 clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation and input valuation techniques.
898173_11_ITEM7_P111_S3	The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, with the exception of the new Level 3 activity disclosures, which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	The adoption of the new Level 3 guidance is required in 2011 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at December 31, 2010; however, from time to time, we had entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure.
898173_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	On July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, November 24, 2008, and January 21, 2010, we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts ( the Swaps ) with a total notional amount of $450 million.
898173_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The interest rate swap transaction that we entered into with BBT on July 24, 2008, for $100 million matured on August 1, 2010; the interest rate swap transaction that we entered into with BBT on October 14, 2008, for $25 million and was scheduled to mature on October 17, 2010, was terminated at our request on September 16, 2010; the interest rate swap transactions we entered into with BBT, BA and/or SunTrust on October 14, 2008, totaling $75 million, matured on October 17, 2010, bringing the total notional amount of swapped debt to $250 million as of December 31, 2010.
898173_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Swaps represented contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
898173_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss.
898173_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $1.1 million ($0.7 million after tax), based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the Swaps.
898173_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	This analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates.
898173_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	In the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our variable interest rate credit facilities, management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk.
898173_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The interest rate contracts are derivative instruments which have been designated as cash flow hedges.
898173_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We do not hold or issue derivative financials instruments for trading purposes.
898173_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	All of the interest rate swap transactions that existed as of December 31, 2010, for a total notional amount of $250 million, were terminated at the Company s request on January 14, 2011, concurrent with the closing and issuance of our 2011 4.875% Senior Notes.
898173_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company ), under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
898173_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
898173_11_ITEM8_P0_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes all policies and procedures that:
898173_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management recognizes that all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
898173_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
898173_11_ITEM8_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk.
898173_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
898173_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
898173_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control Integrated Framework .
898173_11_ITEM8_P4_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2010, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
898173_11_ITEM8_P4_S3	Ernst Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has audited the Company s consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein.
898173_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
898173_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
898173_11_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
898173_11_ITEM8_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
898173_11_ITEM8_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
898173_11_ITEM8_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
898173_11_ITEM8_P5_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
898173_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
898173_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_11_ITEM8_P6_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
898173_11_ITEM8_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
898173_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	In our opinion, O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

898173_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us (including our consolidated subsidiaries) in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
898173_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

898173_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our common stock has traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ORLY since April 22, 1993.
898173_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	On December 29, 2010, we completed a corporate reorganization creating a holding company structure, which was implemented through an agreement and plan of merger under Section 351.448 of The General Corporation Law of the State of Missouri, which did not require a vote of the shareholders.
898173_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	As a result of this reorganization, the previous parent company and registrant, O Reilly Automotive, Inc., was renamed O Reilly Automotive Stores, Inc. and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the new parent company and registrant, which was renamed O Reilly Automotive, Inc.
898173_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	On July 11, 2008, we completed our most recent acquisition, CSK Auto Corporation ( CSK ), which was one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the Western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count at the date of acquisition.
898173_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	At the date of the acquisition, CSK had 1,342 stores in 22 states, operating under four brand names: Checker Auto Parts, Schuck s Auto Supply, Kragen Auto Parts and Murray s Discount Auto Parts.
898173_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	The results of CSK s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.
898173_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	At December 31, 2011, we operated 3,740 stores in 39 states.
898173_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our stores carry an extensive product line, including the products identified below:
898173_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	accessories, such as floor mats, seat covers and truck accessories.
898173_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers, such as those identified below:
898173_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	See Risk Factors beginning on page 14 for a description of certain risks relevant to our business.
898173_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	These risk factors include, among others, deteriorating economic conditions, the performance of the acquired CSK stores, increased debt levels, our acquisition strategies, competition in the automotive aftermarket business, our dependence upon key and other personnel, future growth assurance, our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, the effect of sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, our relationships with key vendors and availability of key products, a downgrade in our credit ratings, complications in our distribution centers ( DC s), and environmental legislation and regulations.
898173_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	OUR BUSINESS Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy.
898173_12_ITEM1_P7_S3	We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O Reilly values of customer service and expense control.
898173_12_ITEM1_P7_S4	Our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve, by providing superior customer service and significant value to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P7_S5	We believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, strategic distribution systems and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages that cannot be easily duplicated.
898173_12_ITEM1_P7_S6	Proven Ability to Execute a Dual Market Strategy:
898173_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Over the past 30 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY customers and professional service providers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage.
898173_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts, capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors, and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P8_S3	In 2011, we derived approximately 59% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 41% of our sales from our professional service provider customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P8_S4	Prior to the acquisition of CSK, we derived approximately 50% of our sales from both our DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P8_S5	As we continue to grow our commercial business in the acquired CSK markets, we expect that over time our DIY and professional service provider sales mix to approximate historical averages.
898173_12_ITEM1_P8_S6	As a result of our historical success of executing our dual market strategy and our over 460 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider, we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional service providers and will continue to have a competitive advantage over our retail competitors who continue to derive a high concentration of their sales from the DIY market.
898173_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Superior Customer Service: We seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below:
898173_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	competitive pricing, supported by a good, better, best product assortment designed to meet all of our customers quality and value preferences Technically Proficient Professional Parts People: Our highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators.
898173_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard parts, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service providers with whom they interact on a daily basis.
898173_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People.
898173_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Strategic Distribution Systems: We believe our commitment to a robust, regional DC network provides for superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network.
898173_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management.
898173_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	We currently operate 23 regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 123,000 stock keeping units ( SKU s), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.
898173_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Experienced Management Team: Our Company philosophy is to promote from with-in and the vast majority of our senior management, district managers and store managers have been promoted from with-in the Company.
898173_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	We augment this promote from with-in philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience.
898173_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	We have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 148 professionals who average 17 years of service; 266 corporate managers who average 13 years of service; and 355 district managers who average 12 years of service.
898173_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	Our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating nineteen consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993.
898173_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Aggressively Open New Stores: We intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket.
898173_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	We plan to open approximately 180 new stores in 2012 increasing our penetration in existing markets and expanding into new, contiguous markets.
898173_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O Reilly stores.
898173_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	We typically open new stores either by (i) constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory, (ii) acquiring an independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store, or (iii) purchasing multi-store chains.
898173_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	New store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities, competing auto parts stores within a pre-determined radius, and the operational strength of such competitors.
898173_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network.
898173_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued sales/profit growth within these markets.
898173_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	Consequently, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.
898173_12_ITEM1_P15_S4	Grow Sales in Existing Stores: Profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy.
898173_12_ITEM1_P15_S5	To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P15_S6	We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability.
898173_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Although the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, we believe the ability of national retail chains, such as ourselves, to operate more efficiently than smaller independent operators or mass merchandisers will result in continued industry consolidation.
898173_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	Thus, our intention is to continue to selectively pursue acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard into new markets.
898173_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Continually Enhance Store Design and Location: Our current prototype store design features enhancements such as optimized square footage, higher ceilings, more convenient interior store layouts, improved in-store signage, brighter lighting, increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance customer service.
898173_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance.
898173_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best serve our customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P17_S3	Grow Professional Relationships with Professional Service Providers in the Western United States:
898173_12_ITEM1_P17_S4	In order to implement our proven dual market strategy throughout the acquired CSK store network and grow our share of the professional service provider market in those areas, we have added four additional DCs to the Western markets since the CSK acquisition.
898173_12_ITEM1_P17_S5	Our strategically located DCs provide converted CSK stores with same-day or overnight delivery access to an average of 123,000 SKUs and give these stores an important tool to provide industry-leading customer service to the professional service provider, as well as the DIY customer.
898173_12_ITEM1_P17_S6	In addition, our Professional Parts People receive ongoing training on our product lines, customer service and O Reilly policies and procedures aimed at building and improving relationships with professional service providers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	The steps we have taken to implement our dual market strategy in the acquired CSK stores have allowed us to begin to capture market share in the Western United States.
898173_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	However, we continue to see significant opportunities to grow our share of the professional service provider business.
898173_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	This growth will be driven by our ability to consistently provide superior customer service and parts availability, proving O Reilly as a reliable partner and elevating our status as the preferred supplier on the call lists of professional service providers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Team Members As of January 31, 2012, we employed 49,148 Team Members (32,700 full-time Team Members and 16,448 part-time Team Members), of whom 41,693 were employed at our stores, 5,917 were employed at our DCs and 1,538 were employed at our corporate and regional offices.
898173_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	A union represents 49 stores (459 Team Members) in the Greater Bay Area in California, and has for many years.
898173_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	In addition, approximately 75 Team Members who drive over-the-road trucks in two of our DCs are represented by a labor union.
898173_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	Except for these Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions.
898173_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	Our tradition of 55 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our Live Green Culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member s contribution to the success of O Reilly.
898173_12_ITEM1_P20_S4	This focus on professionalism and fairness has created an industry-leading team and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent.
898173_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Store Network Store Locations and Size: As a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our stores, on average, carry approximately 21,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,100 total square feet in size.
898173_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	At December 31, 2011, we had a total of approximately 27 million square feet in our 3,740 stores.
898173_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 123,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 192 Hub stores, which, on average, carry approximately 39,000 SKUs and average approximately 10,000 square feet in size.
898173_12_ITEM1_P21_S4	We believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity.
898173_12_ITEM1_P21_S5	Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings and prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares, and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P21_S6	The following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:
898173_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Store Layout: We utilize a computer-assisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent retail merchandise presentation and customize our hard-parts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area.
898173_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access, maximum selling space and to prominently display high-turnover products and accessories to customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	To ensure the best customer experience possible, we have selectively implemented bilingual in-store signage based on the demographics in each store s geographic area.
898173_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Aisle displays and end caps are used to feature high-demand or seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.
898173_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Store Automation: To enhance store-level operations, customer service and reliability, we use Linux servers and IBM I-Series computer systems in our stores.
898173_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	These systems are linked with the I-Series computers located in each of our DCs.
898173_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our point-of-sale terminals provide immediate access to our electronic catalog to graphically display parts and pricing information by make, model and year of vehicle and use barcode scanning technology to price our merchandise.
898173_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	This system speeds transaction times, reduces the customer s checkout time, ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service.
898173_12_ITEM1_P24_S4	Moreover, our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management, strategic planning, inventory control and distribution efficiency.
898173_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are identified below:
898173_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	the type and size of store that should be developed.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S4	Each of our 355 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores, which provides our stores with the appropriate amount of operational support.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S5	District managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S6	Store managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a 40-hour manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S7	District managers and store managers also receive continuous training through on-line assignments, field workshops and regional meetings.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S8	We provide financial incentives to our district managers and all store Team Members through incentive compensation programs.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S9	Under our incentive compensation programs, base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based upon their individual and/or store s sales and profitability.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S10	In addition, each of our district and store managers participates in our stock option program.
898173_12_ITEM1_P27_S11	We believe that our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our district and store Team Members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.
898173_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Professional Parts People We believe our highly trained team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	Because a significant portion of our business is from professional service providers, our Professional Parts People are required to be technically proficient in automotive products.
898173_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	DIY customer often seeks assistance from a Professional Parts Person, particularly when purchasing hard parts.
898173_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.
898173_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	We screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs, or automotive aptitude.
898173_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation about the culture of our Company as well as the requirements for their specific job position.
898173_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P30_S3	Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O Reilly Certified Parts Professional test.
898173_12_ITEM1_P30_S4	Passing the O Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE).
898173_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	All of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with their regional field sales manager.
898173_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	Afterward, these Team Members spend one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P31_S3	Additionally, each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.
898173_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Customer Service We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products.
898173_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	We believe that the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the specific automotive products requested.
898173_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	Accordingly, each O Reilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications.
898173_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in our stores, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.
898173_12_ITEM1_P32_S4	We have no material backlog of orders for the products we sell.
898173_12_ITEM1_P32_S5	Our online ordering service provides enhanced customer service capabilities to our DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P32_S6	Our program allows customers to view available parts and prices online, purchase parts online and/or either ship these purchases to their location or have these parts available for pick up in our local store.
898173_12_ITEM1_P32_S7	We believe that our tiered distribution model provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions, while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory.
898173_12_ITEM1_P32_S8	Moreover, we believe that our ongoing, significant capital investments made to expand the network of DCs allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network.
898173_12_ITEM1_P32_S9	Our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores located in the regions surrounding each DC.
898173_12_ITEM1_P32_S10	We currently have a total growth capacity of approximately 500 stores in our distribution network.
898173_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Distribution Centers: We currently operate 23 DCs comprised of approximately 8.5 million operating square feet (see the Properties table in Item 2 of this Form 10-K for a detailed listing of DC operating square footages).
898173_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our DCs utilize technology to electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores.
898173_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our DCs stock an average of 123,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to multiple other regional DCs inventory.
898173_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to all of our stores in the continental United States.
898173_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	In addition, stores within a DC metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from our DC city counters , many of which receive this service seven days per week.
898173_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	As part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2012 we plan to:
898173_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	make proven, ROI based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs including conveyor systems, picking modules and lift equipment.
898173_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Master Inventory Hub Stores: We currently operate 192 strategically placed Master Inventory Hub stores.
898173_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide our other stores within the surrounding area access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis.
898173_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	Our Hub stores average approximately 3,000 square feet more than our typical stores and carry an average of 18,000 SKUs more than our typical stores.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Products and Purchasing Our stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of brand name and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, BWD, Cardone, Castrol, Gates Rubber, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Quaker State, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	In addition to name brand products, our stores carry a wide variety of high-quality private label products under our BestTest , BrakeBest , Master Pro , Micro-Gard , Murray , Omnispark , O Reilly Auto Parts , Power Torque , Super Start , and Ultima proprietary name brands.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S3	Our private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value a characteristic important to our DIY customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S4	We have added O Reilly branded chemicals and commodities as well as proprietary private label products to all acquired CSK stores.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S5	These stores have also undergone hard-part resets, which significantly increased their hard-part SKU offering, giving our customers in all stores a good, better, and best product offering.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S6	We have no long-term contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S7	We believe that alternative supply sources exist at substantially similar costs, for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S8	It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S9	During 2011, we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S10	As a whole, we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S11	We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500 vendors, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 21% of our total purchases in 2011.
898173_12_ITEM1_P39_S12	Our largest vendor in 2011 accounted for approximately 6% of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for approximately 3% to 6% of such purchases.
898173_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	Marketing Marketing to the DIY Customer: We use an integrated marketing program, which includes television, radio, direct mail and newspaper distribution, in-store and online promotions, and sports and event sponsorships to aggressively attract DIY customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	The marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the O Reilly Brand across our geographic footprint.
898173_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	We utilize a combination of brand and product/price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases, which frequently coincide with key sales events.
898173_12_ITEM1_P40_S3	We continued to co-brand all forms of advertising in the markets containing acquired CSK stores during the first half of 2011.
898173_12_ITEM1_P40_S4	This manner of advertising and marketing was essential to not only build awareness of the O Reilly Brand in those markets, but to also allow for a smoother transition throughout the entire rebranding process.
898173_12_ITEM1_P40_S5	Store signage of all acquired CSK stores was changed to the O Reilly Brand during 2011, at which time co-branding ended and all forms of advertising promoted the O Reilly Brand in all our markets.
898173_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	To stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts, who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public, we sponsored multiple nationally-televised races and over 1,500 grassroots, local, and regional motorsports events throughout 38 states during 2011.
898173_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	We maintained our partnership with the National Association for Stock Car Racing ( NASCAR ) as the Official Auto Parts Store of NASCAR and were the title sponsor of five National Hot Rod Association ( NHRA ) races from Pomona, California to Charlotte, North Carolina.
898173_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	During the fall and winter months, we strategically sponsor National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) basketball and the National Football League ( NFL ).
898173_12_ITEM1_P41_S3	Our relationships with over 50 NCAA teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently-displayed O Reilly logos on TV-visible scoring table signs throughout the season.
898173_12_ITEM1_P41_S4	Through an expanded use of Spanish language radio, print, and outdoor, as well as sponsorships of over 45 local and regional festivals and events, we demonstrated our commitment to increasing marketing efforts that are targeted toward the Hispanic auto parts consumer.
898173_12_ITEM1_P41_S5	In 2011, we continued our dedicated problem/solution communication strategy, which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance as a way to save money and protect their automotive investment over the long-term.
898173_12_ITEM1_P41_S6	This highly relevant message resonates with consumers and establishes O Reilly as their source for the parts they need and excellent customer service.
898173_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Marketing to the Professional Service Provider Customer: We have over 460 full-time O Reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our First Call program.
898173_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	Each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon, selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	Targeted marketing materials such as flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers, paint and body shops and fleet customers.
898173_12_ITEM1_P42_S3	Our industry-leading First Call program enables our sales representatives, district managers, and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services identified below:
898173_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Certified Auto Repair Center Program, a program that provides professional service providers with business tools they can utilize to profitably grow and market their shops Marketing to the Independently Owned Parts Store:
898173_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	Along with the daily operation and management of the DCs and the distribution of automotive products to our stores, Ozark Automotive Distributors, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary ( Ozark ), also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores ( jobber stores ) throughout our trade areas.
898173_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	These jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an O Reilly store.
898173_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	Ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores.
898173_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	Approximately 190 jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from Ozark and participate in our Parts City Auto Parts program, our proprietary jobber service program.
898173_12_ITEM1_P45_S2	As a participant in these programs, a jobber store, which meets certain financial and operational standards, is permitted to indicate its Parts City Auto Parts membership through the display of the respective logo that is owned by Ozark.
898173_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	In return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from Ozark, we provide computer software for business management, competitive pricing, advertising, marketing and sales assistance to Parts City Auto Parts affiliate stores.
898173_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	Pricing We believe that a competitive pricing policy is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business.
898173_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	Product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing policies of competitors in the market area served by each store.
898173_12_ITEM1_P46_S3	Most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of competitor price comparisons and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at a discount to the manufacturer s suggested retail price with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing.
898173_12_ITEM1_P46_S4	Consistent with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any in-stock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area.
898173_12_ITEM1_P46_S5	We have repositioned the product offering and pricing in all acquired CSK stores to an every-day low price strategy to ensure we are competitive in every market in which we operate.
898173_12_ITEM1_P46_S6	We believe competitive pricing is needed to grow our market share and maintain a customer s repeat business, and we believe strongly that this strategy is more sustainable, requires less promotional spending and will produce better results than CSK s historical promotional-based, high/low pricing strategy.
898173_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	Customer Payments and Returns Policy Our stores accept cash, checks, debit and credit cards.
898173_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	We also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our pre-established credit requirements.
898173_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	Some of the factors considered in our pre-established credit requirements include customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_12_ITEM1_P47_S3	No customer accounted for ten percent or more of our consolidated net sales, nor do we have any dependence on any single customer.
898173_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	We accept product returns for new products, core products and warranty/defective products.
898173_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	The automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light- and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale.
898173_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	The total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be $215 billion, according to the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ).
898173_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	This market is made up of four segments labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales and tire sales.
898173_12_ITEM1_P49_S3	Reilly s addressable market within this industry includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and DIY sales.
898173_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	We do not sell tires or perform automotive repairs or installations.
898173_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	Competition We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market.
898173_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	We compete primarily with the stores identified below:
898173_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout and convenient and accessible store locations.
898173_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our dual market strategy requires significant capital expenditures to support, such as the capital expenditures required for the distribution network, store network and inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.
898173_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Inflation and Seasonality We have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	To the extent our acquisition cost increases due to base commodity price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
898173_12_ITEM1_P53_S3	To some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Store sales, profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	Regulations We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, including those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.
898173_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our oil and battery recycling programs.
898173_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party vendors.
898173_12_ITEM1_P55_S3	The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates, deposited into vendor-supplied containers and pallets, and then disposed of by the third-party vendors.
898173_12_ITEM1_P55_S4	In general, our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the vendor.
898173_12_ITEM1_P55_S5	Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date.
898173_12_ITEM1_P55_S6	We cannot give any assurance, however, that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.

898173_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forward-looking statements.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In recent years, worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions, including the United States, and such conditions may worsen in the foreseeable future.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Many of these factors are outside of our control.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our customers purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the U.S., the total number of registered vehicles the U.S., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the U.S.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Also, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	We cannot assure that the recently integrated CSK Auto Corporation ( CSK ) stores will perform at the same desired level of profitability as historic O Reilly stores.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We expect acquired CSK stores to approximate the profitability levels of our core O Reilly stores, and believe this to be a significant factor in achieving our financial goals.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S7	The failure of these stores to attain these profitability levels could seriously impact our forecasted results of operations.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S8	Our ability to operate these stores at our expected level will depend, in part, on the successful preservation of the existing DIY customers already established in these markets, growing the commercial customer base, the adoption of the O Reilly culture, along with maintaining employee morale and the retention of key personnel.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S9	We may not be able to obtain these profitability levels in our acquired CSK stores as soon as we expect, or at all.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S10	If we fail to address the challenges of our new markets effectively, our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected, and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the merger.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P3_S11	A downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive vendor financing programs.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The evaluations are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at a specific rate.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	A downgrade in our current credit rating from both agencies would adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	A downgrade could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our notes, preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In addition, a downgrade could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our vendor financing programs at attractive rates.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Decreased participation in our vendor financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flow.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We have in place, an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	For example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things:
898173_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	expose us to fluctuations in interest rates.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative and negative covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following:
898173_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, as a successor owner or operator, may be liable.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Both the DIY and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P7_S5	We may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P7_S6	For a list of our principal competitors, see the Competition section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S6	We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient, and as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S7	For a discussion of our management, see the Business section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K. We cannot assure future growth will be achieved.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S8	We believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S10	We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2012 and beyond will be achieved.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P8_S12	For a discussion of our growth strategies, see the Growth Strategy section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our costs and sales.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Approximately 28% of our stores are located in Texas and California.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Therefore, our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of those regions.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to DIY customers.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition, our stores located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S6	All of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S7	We cannot predict the effect, if any, which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S8	We believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, could affect our stock price.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S10	We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S11	If our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S12	We cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of CSK will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S13	If we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our business would likely suffer.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S14	The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S15	The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S16	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S17	Failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P9_S18	In addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	A change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	For example, financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S6	In addition, the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors, and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, operability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S9	Weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters or the threat of them, may result in the closure of our distribution centers ( DC s) or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S10	This may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S11	Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or other catastrophic events.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	A breach of customer, Team Member or Company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and Team Members.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Environmental legislation and regulations could affect our operations, such as by increasing fuel prices, and therefore increase our operating costs.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, which could adversely impact all industries.
898173_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	While it is uncertain whether these will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming, and these mandates, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, including, among other things, increasing fuel prices.
898173_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	centers and other properties We currently operate 23 regional distribution centers ( DC s).
898173_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we leased eight DCs (2.8 million operating square footage) and owned 15 DCs (5.7 million operating square footage) for total DC square footage of 8.5 million.
898173_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	The following table provides information regarding our DCs, returns facilities and corporate offices as of December 31, 2011:
898173_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	(2) Occupied under the terms of a lease with an affiliated party Of the 23 DCs that we operated at December 31, 2011, 15 were owned and 8 were leased.
898173_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	The leased facilities typically require a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expense and have an original term of, at a minimum, 20 years, subject to one five-year renewal at our option.
898173_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	One of our bulk facilities is leased from an entity owned by an affiliated director s immediate family.
898173_12_ITEM2_P1_S3	This lease requires payment of a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of 15 years, subject to three five-year renewals at our option.
898173_12_ITEM2_P1_S4	We believe that this lease agreement with the affiliated entity is on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.
898173_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	Of the 3,740 stores that we operated at December 31, 2011, 1,286 stores were owned, 2,381 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 77 stores were leased from entities in which certain of our affiliated directors, members of our affiliated director s immediate family, or our executive officers, are affiliated.
898173_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	Leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of, at a minimum, 10 years, subject to one or more renewals at our option.
898173_12_ITEM2_P2_S2	We have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby.
898173_12_ITEM2_P2_S3	Such master lease agreements with two of the six affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores.
898173_12_ITEM2_P2_S4	The master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from March 31, 2013, to September 30, 2031.
898173_12_ITEM2_P2_S5	We believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.
898173_12_ITEM2_P2_S6	We believe that our present facilities are in good condition, are adequately insured and are adequate for the conduct of our current operations.
898173_12_ITEM2_P2_S7	The store servicing capability of our 23 existing DCs is approximately 4,340 stores, providing a growth capacity of more than 500 stores.
898173_12_ITEM2_P2_S8	We believe this growth capacity will provide us with the DC infrastructure needed for near-term expansion without the need for additional DC facilities.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	O Reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company s business.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Company records reserves for litigation losses in instances where a material adverse outcome is probable and the Company is able to reasonably estimate the probable loss.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	The Company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred in pending litigation matters.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, it does not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters, taking into account applicable insurance and reserves, will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S4	In addition, O Reilly is involved in resolving governmental investigations that were being conducted against CSK and CSK s former officers and other litigation, prior to its acquisition by O Reilly, as described below.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S5	CSK Pre-Acquisition Matters Governmental Investigations and Actions: As previously reported, the governmental investigations of CSK regarding its legacy pre-acquisition accounting practices have concluded.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S6	CSK s former Controller and its former Director of Credit and Receivables pled guilty to obstruction of justice on April 7, 2009 and April 15, 2009, respectively, as previously reported.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S7	They were sentenced on November 7, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S8	CSK s former Chief Financial Officer was sentenced, as previously reported, on September 19, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S9	Accordingly, with the sentencing on November 7, 2011, criminal proceedings against former CSK employees have reached finality.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S10	The action filed by the SEC on July 22, 2009, against Maynard L. Jenkins, the former Chief Executive Officer of CSK, seeking reimbursement from Mr. Jenkins of certain bonuses and stock sale profits pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as previously reported, has also reached finality.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S11	On November 16, 2011, the Court entered a Final Judgment which required Mr. Jenkins to reimburse $2.8 million to the Company as successor SEC issuer to CSK Auto Corp.
898173_12_ITEM3_P0_S12	Since entry of the Final Judgment, the payment obligation created thereunder has been satisfied and O Reilly has recorded the reimbursement as an adjustment to operating income in the fourth quarter of 2011.
898173_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	The previously reported SEC civil action for alleged misconduct related to CSK s historical accounting practices against the former Chief Financial Officer, Controller and Director of Credit and Receivables of CSK, remains ongoing.
898173_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	However, on January 20, 2012, the parties filed a Joint Report On Settlement Talks wherein they report that offers of settlement had been made which would be presented to the Commission for its consideration and approval.
898173_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	The parties have requested a complete litigation standstill while the Commission considers the settlement offers made.
898173_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	Under Delaware law, the charter documents of the CSK entities, and certain indemnification agreements, CSK may have certain indemnification obligations in connection with the SEC civil action, and, as a result, O Reilly is currently incurring legal fees in relation to the ongoing SEC litigation.
898173_12_ITEM3_P1_S4	Some of these indemnification obligations and other related costs may not be covered by CSK s insurance policies.
898173_12_ITEM3_P1_S5	As a result of the CSK acquisition, O Reilly has incurred and expects to continue to incur additional legal fees and costs related to the indemnity obligations arising from the litigation commenced by the DOJ and SEC against CSK s former employees until final resolution of the remaining matters.
898173_12_ITEM3_P1_S6	Reilly has a remaining reserve, with respect to the indemnification obligations of $14.1 million at December 31, 2011, which relates to both expected additional legal fees and costs and to the payment of those legal fees and costs already incurred.
898173_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	The remaining litigation, as described above, is subject to uncertainty, and, given its complexity and scope, the final outcome cannot be predicted at this time.
898173_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	It is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the Company s results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by an ultimate resolution of such matter, depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flows for such period.
898173_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	However, at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of the pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves should not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

898173_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States.
898173_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ( DIY ) customers and professional service providers.
898173_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment.
898173_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer.
898173_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good , better , and best alternatives.
898173_12_ITEM7_P4_S5	Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products.
898173_12_ITEM7_P4_S6	Consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry.
898173_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we operated 3,740 stores in 39 states.
898173_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits and competition.
898173_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact O Reilly and the retail sector in general.
898173_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	We believe that the average consumer s tendency has been to trade-down to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions.
898173_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of purchasing up on the value spectrum.
898173_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	We have ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers; however, we cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change.
898173_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.
898173_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.
898173_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Historically, the long-term trend in the total miles driven in the U.S. has steadily increased; however, according to the Department of Transportation, total miles driven in the U.S. have remained relatively flat since 2007 as the U.S. has experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions.
898173_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Historically, rapid increases in gasoline prices have negatively impacted U.S. total miles driven as consumers react to the increased expense by reducing travel.
898173_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Average gasoline prices increased 7% in 2011, compared to an increase of 18% in 2010.
898173_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	We believe that as the U.S. economy recovers and gasoline prices stabilize, annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to drive demand for the industry.
898173_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the U.S. vehicle population also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket.
898173_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ), the total number of registered vehicles has increased 17% over the past decade, from 205 million light vehicles in 2000 to 240 million light vehicles in 2010.
898173_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	New light vehicle registrations, however, have declined 34% over the past decade, from 17 million registrations in 2000 to 11 million registrations in 2010.
898173_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	As of December 31, 2011, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales of total light vehicles in the U.S. was 13 million, indicating that the trend of declining new light vehicle registrations has reversed, however total sales of light vehicles has remained below historical rates for the past three years, contributing to an aging U.S. vehicle population.
898173_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	As reported by the AAIA, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased 19% over the past decade, from 8.9 years in 2000 to 10.6 years in 2010.
898173_12_ITEM7_P10_S5	We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors; depressed new car sales over the past three years at below historical levels; and the consumer s willingness to invest in maintaining their higher-mileage, better built vehicles.
898173_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty.
898173_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles.
898173_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	Based on this change in consumer sentiment surrounding the length of time older vehicles can be reliably driven at higher mileages, we believe consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer as the economy recovers maintaining the trend of an aging vehicle population.
898173_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Unemployment - Unemployment rates and continued uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending.
898173_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The annual U.S. unemployment rate over the past two years has remained at 30-year highs.
898173_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	We believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money, which can be an important factor in the consumer s decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle and maintain their existing vehicle.
898173_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	While the deferral of vehicle purchases has led to an increase in vehicle maintenance, long-term trends of high unemployment could continue to impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket.
898173_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	We believe that as the economy recovers, unemployment will return to more historic levels and we will see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work.
898173_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Aided by these increased commuter miles, overall annual U.S. miles driven should begin to grow resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:
898173_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	On January 11, 2011, we announced a new Board-approved share repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to $500 million of shares of our common stock over a three-year period.
898173_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	Our Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $500 million on August 5, 2011, and an additional $500 million on November 16, 2011, raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to $1.5 billion.
898173_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	The additional $500 million authorizations are effective for three-year periods, expiring on August 5, 2014, and November 16, 2014.
898173_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	As of February 28, 2012, we had repurchased approximately 16.5 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $1 billion under this program.
898173_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	(the ABL Credit Facility ), pay fees and expenses related to the offering and for general corporate purposes.
898173_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Concurrent with the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021, we entered into a 5-year credit agreement for a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) arranged by Bank of America ( BA ) and Barclays Capital to provide additional financial flexibility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	All remaining debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility, totaling $22 million were written off, and all interest rate swap agreements related to notional amounts under the ABL Credit Facility, with a carrying value of $4 million, were terminated and charged to earnings as one-time, non-recurring items upon the repayment and retirement of the ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011, which is included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
898173_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	On September 9, 2011, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility with BA, which decreased the facility to $660 million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	The amendment also extended the maturity of our Revolving Credit Facility to September of 2016.
898173_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	In conjunction with the amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of $0.3 million, which is included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
898173_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased $391 million to $5.79 billion from $5.40 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7.2%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.6% and 8.8% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
898173_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members.
898173_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 (in millions):
898173_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our comparable store sales increase for the year was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decline in customer transaction counts.
898173_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the continued growth of the higher priced, hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales, and the impact of increased raw material acquisition costs, which were passed through to increased selling prices during the period.
898173_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	The growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and a shift in DIY sales to the hard part categories.
898173_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	During the year, DIY customer transaction counts were negatively impacted by the continued pressure on disposable income that our customers faced as a result of increased fuel costs and sustained unemployment levels above historical averages, which offset strong increases in professional service provider transaction counts.
898173_12_ITEM7_P22_S5	We opened 170 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 149 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2010.
898173_12_ITEM7_P22_S6	At December 31, 2011, we operated 3,740 stores in 39 states compared to 3,570 stores in 38 states at December 31, 2010.
898173_12_ITEM7_P22_S7	We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 180 net, new stores in 2012.
898173_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $2.84 billion (or 49.0% of sales) from $2.62 billion (or 48.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores.
898173_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable product mix, improved acquisition costs, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution center efficiencies, partially offset by the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of the total sales mix.
898173_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	The improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a high gross profit as a percentage of sales.
898173_12_ITEM7_P23_S4	Increasing hard part sales is the result of strong demand as consumers retain and maintain their vehicles beyond manufacturer warranty periods and our strong growth in sales to professional service providers in the acquired markets.
898173_12_ITEM7_P23_S5	The improved shrinkage is driven by our converted CSK stores, which are now managed using the O Reilly point-of-sale system ( POS ), installed in all CSK stores as they converted to the O Reilly distribution systems throughout 2009 and 2010.
898173_12_ITEM7_P23_S6	The O Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory, resulting in improved inventory shrinkage.
898173_12_ITEM7_P23_S7	Distribution center efficiencies are the result of leverage on increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced distribution center Team Members in our newer DCs.
898173_12_ITEM7_P23_S8	Professional service provider sales in the acquired CSK markets are growing at a faster rate than total DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in those markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy.
898173_12_ITEM7_P23_S9	Professional service provider sales typically carry a lower overall gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service providers, consequently creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales.
898173_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $1.97 billion (or 34.1% of sales) from $1.89 billion (or 35.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 5%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count.
898173_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy and headquarters costs on strong comparable store sales, improved store payroll efficiencies and positive trends related to health benefits, partially offset by increased fuel costs for our store delivery vehicles supporting our growing commercial business.
898173_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Operating income: Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $867 million (or 15.0% of sales) from $713 million (or 13.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 22%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	The increase in operating income during the year was primarily due to the impacts discussed above, as well as $3 million of nonrecurring income in the current year related to a settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to CSK of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer (discussed in detail below see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements) versus a $21 million charge to operating income in the prior year, related to the previously announced legacy CSK DOJ investigation (discussed in detail below see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
898173_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG A from strong comparable store sales.
898173_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $51 million (or 0.9% of sales), from $23 million (or 0.4% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 118%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	The increase in total other expense for the year was primarily due to one-time charges related to our new financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), offset by decreased interest expense on a lower average interest rate on outstanding borrowings, a lower facility fee on our revolving credit facility and less amortization of debt issuance costs in the current period as compared to the borrowing rates, facility fee and amortization of debt issuance costs in the prior period.
898173_12_ITEM7_P25_S5	In addition, during 2010, we recognized a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK (discussed in detail below).
898173_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $308 million (37.8% effective tax rate) from $270 million (39.2% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 14%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income.
898173_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	The decrease in the effective rate was primarily the result of the $21 million charge recorded in 2010 related to the legacy United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) investigation of CSK, discussed in detail below, which was not deductible for tax purposes.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $508 million (or 8.8% of sales), from $419 million (or 7.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 21%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 26% to $3.71 on 137 million shares from $2.95 on 142 million shares for the same period one year ago.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	The impact of share repurchases during 2011 on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately $0.19.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK, of $3 million ($2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	This clawback amount was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S6	The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million ($13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $4 ($3 million, net of tax).
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S7	The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in Other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S8	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010, included a nonrecurring, non-operating gain in Other income (expense) of $12 million ($7 million, net of tax) related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the CSK acquisition, as well as a charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation into CSK s pre-acquisition historical accounting practices.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S9	We accrued $21 million during 2010 in anticipation of executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement ( NPA ) among the DOJ, CSK and O Reilly and paying a one-time monetary penalty of $21 million.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S10	During the third quarter of 2011, the NPA was executed and the previously recorded, one-time $21 million penalty was paid to the DOJ on behalf of CSK.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S11	The charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2010.
898173_12_ITEM7_P27_S12	The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table.
898173_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 18% to $864 million (or 14.9% of sales) from $734 million (or 13.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago.
898173_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 21% to $522 million (or 9.0% of sales) from $433 million (or 8.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago.
898173_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2011, increased 25% to $3.81 from $3.05 for the same period one year ago.
898173_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	The table below outlines the impact of the charges related to the new financing transactions, the former CSK officer clawback, the legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge, as well as the gain on the settlement of the note receivable for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (amounts in thousands, except per share data):
898173_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	The financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
898173_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, the former CSK officer clawback, the charges for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation and the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations.
898173_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_12_ITEM7_P30_S5	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Compared to 2009 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased $550 million to $5.4 billion from $4.85 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 11%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales during the one- to two-week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion.
898173_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 8.8% and 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
898173_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 (in millions):
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	We believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	The improvement in comparable store sales for the year was driven both by increased transaction counts and higher average ticket values.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	We believe that the increase in transaction counts was a result of the customer s focus on better maintaining their current vehicles, the stabilization of the economy and gas prices during the year and the growth of our commercial business in the acquired CSK markets.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S3	The improvement in average ticket value was primarily the result of a larger percentage of our total sales derived from higher priced hard parts categories.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S4	We opened 149 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 142 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2009.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S5	At December 31, 2010, we operated 3,570 stores compared to 3,421 stores at December 31, 2009.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S6	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $2.62 billion (or 48.6% of sales) from $2.33 billion (or 48.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S7	The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S8	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was the result of improved product mix, lower product acquisition costs and decreased inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percent of the total sales mix and reduced leverage on the expanded number of distribution centers.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S9	The improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a higher gross margin percentage than other categories.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S10	Increasing hard part sales were the result of strong consumer demand as consumers retained their vehicles longer and our enhanced and more comprehensive inventory levels in the hard part categories in the CSK stores, supported by a more extensive and robust distribution network.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S11	Lower product acquisition costs were derived from improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as the result of large purchase volume increases associated with the acquisition of CSK.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S12	The benefit of this improvement in gross margin was realized in the first and second quarters of 2010 as compared to the same periods in 2009 when we renegotiated these vendor contracts.
898173_12_ITEM7_P33_S13	Our gross margin results for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 reflected comparable periods of improved purchasing leverage.
898173_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	The decrease in inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores was the result of the more robust O Reilly point of sale system ( POS ), which was installed in all CSK stores when they converted to the O Reilly distribution systems.
898173_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	The O Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory resulting in improved inventory shrinkage.
898173_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	Commercial sales are growing at a faster rate than DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in our western markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy in these areas.
898173_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross margin percentage than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional customers, and create pressure on our gross margin as a percent of sales.
898173_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	The reduced leverage on distribution center costs was the result of the additional distribution centers, which were opened in conjunction with the CSK integration plan.
898173_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	New Team Members in these distribution centers were not yet fully proficient with distribution operations, resulting in inefficiencies.
898173_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: SG A for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $1.89 billion (or 35.0% of sales) from $1.79 billion (or 36.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 6%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count and dual market strategy in the acquired CSK stores, as well as increased incentive compensation for Team Members resulting from strong comparable store sales.
898173_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased leverage of fixed costs on very strong comparable store sales levels.
898173_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Operating income: Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $713 million (or 13.2% of sales) from $538 million (or 11.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 33%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	The increase in operating income was the result of increased sales and gross profit, offset by the increased SG A discussed above as well as a $21 million charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation of CSK as discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 12 Legal Matters to the consolidated financial statements.
898173_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG A costs from strong comparable store sales.
898173_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	Other income and expense: Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, decreased to $39 million (or 0.7% of sales) from $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing a decrease of 13%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	The decrease in interest expense during 2010 as compared to 2009 was the result of a lower level of average outstanding borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P37_S5	Included as a component of Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010, was a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK.
898173_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $270 million (39.2% effective tax rate) from $189 million (38.1% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 43%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income.
898173_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	The increase in the effective rate was primarily the result of the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation of $21 million which was not deductible for tax purposes.
898173_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $419 million (or 7.8% of sales) from $307 million (or 6.3% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 36%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 32% to $2.95 on 142 million shares from $2.23 on 138 million shares for the same period one year ago.
898173_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010, included charges related to the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired from CSK discussed above, as well as the charges related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation discussed above.
898173_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	Adjusted operating income increased 37% to $734 million (13.6% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $538 million (11.1% of sales), for the same period one year ago.
898173_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	Adjusted net income increased 41% to $433 million (8.0% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $307 million (6.3% of sales), for the same period one year ago.
898173_12_ITEM7_P39_S5	Adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased 37% to $3.05 for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $2.23 for the same period one year ago.
898173_12_ITEM7_P39_S6	The table below outlines the impact of the charges related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in thousands, except per share data):
898173_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	The financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with GAAP.
898173_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.

898173_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program.
898173_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations.
898173_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
898173_12_ITEM7_P42_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels.
898173_12_ITEM7_P42_S6	Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in millions):
898173_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	(1) Quick assets include cash, cash equivalents and receivables.
898173_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	(2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.
898173_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	(3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities.
898173_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	(4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities.
898173_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	(5) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by shareholders equity.
898173_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Total debt increased 122% and total equity decreased 11% from 2010 to 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	The increase in total debt was attributable the issuance of our senior notes during 2011, partially offset by the repayment of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year and an increase in additional paid-in-capital from the proceeds of stock option exercises, and related excess tax benefits, executed under our director and employee share-based compensation plans.
898173_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands): Operating activities: The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to strong net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011 and deferred income taxes) and a significant decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in other current liabilities (driven by the payment of the one-time penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation).
898173_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors.
898173_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	Our net inventory investment significantly decreased as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs as well as our ongoing efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems.
898173_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	Our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors.
898173_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 64.4% and 44.3% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
898173_12_ITEM7_P49_S4	Our efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems resulted in a decrease in total inventory of $37 million during the year, despite the fact that we opened 170 new stores during the year.
898173_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net income (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges and deferred income taxes), a significant decrease in net inventory investment and an increase in other liabilities as compared to the same period in 2009.
898173_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	The decrease in net inventory investment in 2010 as compared to 2009 was the result of the significant investments in 2009 to improve the inventory availability in the acquired CSK stores.
898173_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	The increase in other liabilities was principally due to the accrual of the CSK DOJ investigation charge during 2010, which was paid in 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Investing activities: The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures.
898173_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	Total capital expenditures were $328 million in 2011, $365 million in 2010 and $415 million in 2009.
898173_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	During 2010, we completed the comprehensive expansion of our distribution system in the CSK markets and the conversion of the CSK stores to the O Reilly POS, resulting in reduced levels of conversion related capital expenditures during 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the integration of CSK and an increase in payments received on notes receivable.
898173_12_ITEM7_P51_S4	Capital expenditures related to the acquisition of CSK included the purchase of properties for distribution centers ( DC s) and costs associated with the conversion of CSK stores to the O Reilly Brand.
898173_12_ITEM7_P51_S5	Although we opened four new DCs in 2010, a significant portion of the capital expenditures for these DCs occurred in 2009 as we acquired property and began construction of the facilities.
898173_12_ITEM7_P51_S6	The increase in payments received on notes receivable was due to the one-time nonrecurring payment received to settle a note receivable acquired in the CSK acquisition.
898173_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	We opened 170 net, new stores in 2011, 149 net, new stores in 2010 and 150 net, new stores in 2009.
898173_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	We plan to open 180 net, new stores in 2012.
898173_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.
898173_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Financing activities: The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2011 in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program, which was partially offset by an increase in net long term borrowings in 2011 as compared to net repayments under our facilities during 2010.
898173_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	The net borrowings in 2011 are the result of proceeds from the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 and our 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 in January and September of 2011, respectively, partially offset by the repayment and termination of our previous ABL Credit Facility and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the issuance of our senior notes and the establishment of our new unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	The net repayments under our facilities in 2010 were the result of our focus on using available cash on hand to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings under our secured ABL Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	Net cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 is driven by the increase in net repayments of outstanding borrowings on our long-term debt.
898173_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Credit facilities: On July 11, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in July of 2013.
898173_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding borrowings of $356 million under the ABL Credit Facility, of which $106 million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract.
898173_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	All outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility were repaid, and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on January 14, 2011, and the ABL Credit Facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021, as further described below.
898173_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	In conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million and a one-time charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of $4 million, which are included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million unsecured Revolving Credit Facility arranged by BA and Barclays Capital, which was scheduled to mature in January of 2016.
898173_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	During 2011, we amended the unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which decreased the facility to $660 million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	The amendment also extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to September of 2016.
898173_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	In conjunction with the amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of $0.3 million, which is included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings.
898173_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	As described in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million.
898173_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we had stand-by letters of credit, primarily to satisfy workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $60 million.
898173_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Senior Notes: 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021: On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ) at a price to the public of 99.297% of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. ( UMB ) as trustee.
898173_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, which began on July 14, 2011, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.
898173_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	The net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the offering and costs associated with terminating our existing interest rate swap contracts, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes.
898173_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	4.625% Senior Notes due 2021: On September 19, 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ) at a price to the public of 99.826% of their face value with UMB as trustee.
898173_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	Interest on the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year beginning on March 15, 2012, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.
898173_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	The net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering, with the remainder intended to be used to repay borrowings outstanding from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries ( Subsidiary Guarantors ) that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility or certain of our other debt or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S3	Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S4	Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S5	Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S6	Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S7	These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S8	The Credit Agreement contains covenants, including limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.0 times through December 31, 2012; 2.25 times through December 31, 2014; 2.5 times through maturity; and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0 times through maturity.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S9	The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock option compensation expense ( EBITDAR ) to adjusted debt.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S10	Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S11	In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken against us, including but not limited to possible termination of credit extensions, immediate payment of outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and litigation from our lenders.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S12	We had a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.86 times and 4.21 times as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio of 1.75 times and 1.57 times as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.
898173_12_ITEM7_P60_S13	Under our current financing policy, we have targeted an adjusted consolidated leverage ratio range of 2.0 times to 2.25 times.
898173_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The table below outlines the calculations of the fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):
898173_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	The fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
898173_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	We believe that the presentation of our fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement.
898173_12_ITEM7_P62_S3	We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_12_ITEM7_P62_S4	Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_12_ITEM7_P62_S5	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
898173_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	We have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost-effective alternative to our existing sources of cash.
898173_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	We do not believe, however, that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans.
898173_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	On December 29, 2000, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with an unrelated party.
898173_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	Under the terms of the transaction, we sold 90 properties, including land, buildings and improvements, which generated $52 million of cash.
898173_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	The lease, which is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional successive periods of five years each.
898173_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	The resulting gain of $5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term.
898173_12_ITEM7_P64_S4	Net rent expense during the initial term is approximately $5 million annually.
898173_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	In August 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback with O Reilly-Wooten, 2001 LLP (an entity owned by certain of our affiliates).
898173_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	The transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine O Reilly Auto Parts stores and generated approximately $6 million of cash.
898173_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss.
898173_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	The lease, which has been accounted for as an operating lease, calls for an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options.
898173_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies.
898173_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance.
898173_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	Letters of credit totaling $60 million and $71 million were outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
898173_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 5 Long-Term Debt and Note 11 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	Deferred income taxes and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment s cancellation terms.
898173_12_ITEM7_P67_S3	Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2012, which are included in Current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
898173_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	(1) On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in January of 2016.
898173_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	On September 9, 2011, we amended the Credit Agreement, decreasing the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to $660 million, extending the maturity date on the Credit Agreement to September of 2016 and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.975% to 1.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services.
898173_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above.
898173_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.150% to 0.400% based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services.
898173_12_ITEM7_P69_S3	Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans is 0.200%, our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 1.200% and our facility fee is 0.175%.
898173_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	(2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year.
898173_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments.
898173_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits.
898173_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	These liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities, however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 14 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_12_ITEM7_P71_S3	These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined.
898173_12_ITEM7_P71_S4	As of December 31, 2011, we recorded a liability of $53 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of Other liabilities .
898173_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management.
898173_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
898173_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates.
898173_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP.
898173_12_ITEM7_P72_S4	However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S4	We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S5	This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S6	Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S7	We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S8	We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S9	We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and DCs.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S10	To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S11	We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates.
898173_12_ITEM7_P73_S12	If unrecorded shrink changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business.
898173_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors.
898173_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	Actual results have consistently been within management s expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts.
898173_12_ITEM7_P74_S3	However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains.
898173_12_ITEM7_P74_S4	If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment.
898173_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset.
898173_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	The estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations.
898173_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.
898173_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets.
898173_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment.
898173_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	We review goodwill for impairment annually on November 30, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	We have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill.
898173_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach.
898173_12_ITEM7_P79_S2	Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value.
898173_12_ITEM7_P79_S3	In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2011, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing.
898173_12_ITEM7_P79_S4	If the price of O Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.
898173_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Vendor concessions We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates.
898173_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory.
898173_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns.
898173_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations.
898173_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations.
898173_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
898173_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits.
898173_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim.
898173_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations.
898173_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities.
898173_12_ITEM7_P84_S3	Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains.
898173_12_ITEM7_P84_S4	As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information.
898173_12_ITEM7_P84_S5	These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value.
898173_12_ITEM7_P84_S6	These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_12_ITEM7_P84_S7	We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities.
898173_12_ITEM7_P84_S8	If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $11 million or 1.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Closed Property Reserves We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations.
898173_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income.
898173_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms.
898173_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions.
898173_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates.
898173_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known.
898173_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Legal Reserves We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O Reilly is currently involved.
898173_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations and litigation that are being conducted against certain of CSK s former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date.
898173_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	As a result of the acquisition, we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations.
898173_12_ITEM7_P87_S3	Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK.
898173_12_ITEM7_P87_S4	Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures.
898173_12_ITEM7_P87_S5	If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
898173_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve.
898173_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit.
898173_12_ITEM7_P88_S3	The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings.
898173_12_ITEM7_P88_S4	Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations.
898173_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented.
898173_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates.
898173_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position.
898173_12_ITEM7_P89_S3	While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority.
898173_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
898173_12_ITEM7_P90_S3	To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_12_ITEM7_P90_S4	While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2011 and 2010.
898173_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown.
898173_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.
898173_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	In January of 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ( 2010-06 ).
898173_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	ASU 2010-06 amends Subtopic 820-10, requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements such as transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, as well as separate disclosures about activity relating to Level 3 measurements.
898173_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	ASU 2010-06 clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation and input valuation techniques.
898173_12_ITEM7_P92_S3	The updated guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, with the exception of the new Level 3 activity disclosures, which were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
898173_12_ITEM7_P92_S4	The application of this guidance affected disclosures only and therefore, did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	In May of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( 2011-04 ).
898173_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	ASU 2011-04 was issued to bring the definition of fair value, the guidance for fair value measurement and the disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) in line with one another.
898173_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	ASU 2011-04 also enhanced the disclosure requirements for changes and transfers within the valuation hierarchy levels, particularly valuations in Level 3 fair value measurements, and was effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM7_P93_S3	The application of this guidance affects disclosures only and therefore, should not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	In June of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income ( 2011-05 ).
898173_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	ASU 2011-05 was issued to improve the comparability of financial reporting between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, and eliminates previous U.S. GAAP guidance that allowed an entity to present components of other comprehensive income ( OCI ) as part of its statement of changes in shareholders equity.
898173_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	With the issuance of ASU 2011-05, companies are now required to report all components of OCI either in a single continuous statement of total comprehensive income, which includes components of both OCI and net income, or in a separate statement appearing consecutively with the statement of income.
898173_12_ITEM7_P94_S3	ASU 2011-05 does not affect current guidance for the accounting of the components of OCI, or which items are included within total comprehensive income.
898173_12_ITEM7_P94_S4	In December of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 ( 2011-12 ).
898173_12_ITEM7_P94_S5	ASU 2011-12 defers changes in ASU 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments shown on the face of the financial statements.
898173_12_ITEM7_P94_S6	No other requirements of ASU 2011-05 were affected by the issuance of ASU 2011-12, including the requirement to report income either in a single continuous financial statement or in a separate statement of total comprehensive income, which is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
898173_12_ITEM7_P94_S7	We adopted this guidance with our 2011 financial statements; the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore, did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	In September of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment ( 2011-08 ).
898173_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	ASU 2011-08 was issued to simplify the impairment test of goodwill, by allowing entities to use a qualitative approach to determine whether goodwill impairment might exist, before completing the entire impairment test.
898173_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	Under ASU 2011-08, an entity has the option to first assess any qualitative factors that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
898173_12_ITEM7_P95_S3	The changes under ASU 2011-08 are effective for public companies for annual and interim testing performed for periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
898173_12_ITEM7_P95_S4	The application of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Historically, we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates, however, as of December 31, 2011, we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 30 days or less.
898173_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal.
898173_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $362 million.
898173_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company ), under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) or 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
898173_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
898173_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes all policies and procedures that:
898173_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management recognizes that all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
898173_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
898173_12_ITEM8_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk.
898173_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
898173_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM8_P4_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control Integrated Framework .
898173_12_ITEM8_P4_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2011, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
898173_12_ITEM8_P4_S3	Ernst Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has audited the Company s consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein.
898173_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
898173_12_ITEM8_P5_S1	Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
898173_12_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
898173_12_ITEM8_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
898173_12_ITEM8_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
898173_12_ITEM8_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
898173_12_ITEM8_P5_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
898173_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
898173_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_12_ITEM8_P6_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
898173_12_ITEM8_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

898173_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of business: O Reilly Automotive, Inc.
898173_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	( O Reilly or the Company ) is a specialty retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts.
898173_12_ITEM8_P15_S2	The Company s stores carry an extensive product line, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and various automotive accessories.
898173_12_ITEM8_P15_S3	The Company owns and operates 3,740 stores in 39 states, covering all regions of the United States except the Northeast, and caters to both the do-it-yourself ( DIY ) customer and the professional service provider.
898173_12_ITEM8_P15_S4	The Company s robust distribution system provides stores with same-day or overnight access to an extensive inventory of hard-to-find items not typically stocked in the stores of other auto parts retailers.
898173_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	Segment reporting: The Company is managed and operated by a single management team reporting to the chief operating decision maker.
898173_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Reilly stores have similar characteristics including the nature of the products and services, the type and class of customers and the methods used to distribute products and provide service to its customers and, as a whole, make up a single operating segment.
898173_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company does not prepare discrete financial information with respect to product lines or geographic locations and as such has one reportable segment.
898173_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
898173_12_ITEM8_P18_S2	These reclassifications had no effect on reported totals for assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, cash flows or net income.
898173_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
898173_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
898173_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
898173_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
898173_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	Cash equivalents: Cash equivalents include investments with maturities of 90 days or less on the date of purchase.
898173_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	Accounts receivable: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company s customers to make required payments.
898173_12_ITEM8_P21_S2	The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection is reasonably assured: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_12_ITEM8_P21_S3	Amounts due to the Company from its Team Members are included as a component of accounts receivable.
898173_12_ITEM8_P21_S4	These amounts consist primarily of purchases of merchandise on Team Member accounts.
898173_12_ITEM8_P21_S5	Accounts receivable due from Team Members was approximately $2.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
898173_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company s pre-established credit requirements.
898173_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to these receivables are limited because the Company s customer base consists of a large number of smaller customers, spreading the credit risk across a broad base.
898173_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	The Company also controls this credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and accounts receivable and credit monitoring procedures.
898173_12_ITEM8_P22_S3	Generally, the Company does not require security when credit is granted to customers.
898173_12_ITEM8_P22_S4	Credit losses are provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements and have consistently been within management s expectations.
898173_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Amounts receivable from vendors: The Company receives concessions from its vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for new stores and warranties, volume purchase rebates and co-operative advertising.
898173_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to the Company s advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_12_ITEM8_P23_S2	All other vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory.
898173_12_ITEM8_P23_S3	Amounts receivable from vendors also includes amounts due to the Company for changeover merchandise and product returns.
898173_12_ITEM8_P23_S4	The Company regularly reviews vendor receivables for collectability and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectable amounts based on an evaluation of the Company s vendors financial positions and corresponding abilities to meet financial obligations.
898173_12_ITEM8_P23_S5	Management does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the Company will be unable to collect the amounts receivable from vendors and the Company did not record a reserve for uncollectable amounts from vendors in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2011 or 2010.
898173_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventory: Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	Inventory also includes capitalized costs related to procurement, warehousing and distribution centers ( DC ).
898173_12_ITEM8_P24_S2	Cost has been determined using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method, which more accurately matches costs with related revenues.
898173_12_ITEM8_P24_S3	The replacement cost of inventory was $2.04 billion and $2.05 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
898173_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Property and equipment: Property and equipment are carried at cost.
898173_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method generally over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
898173_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated economic life of the assets.
898173_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	The lease term includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception for which failure to renew options would result in a substantial economic penalty to the Company.
898173_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
898173_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	Upon retirement or sale, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the gain or loss, if any, is included as a component of Other income (expense) in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income.
898173_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
898173_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	The following table identifies the types of property and equipment included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands, except useful lives):
898173_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	The gross value of capital lease assets included in the Vehicles amounts of the above table was $8.6 million and $9.6 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
898173_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded accumulated amortization on these capital lease assets in the amounts of $7.9 million and $7.5 million, respectively, all of which was included in accumulated depreciation and amortization in the above table.
898173_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company capitalizes interest costs as a component of construction in progress, based on the weighted-average interest rates incurred on long-term borrowings.
898173_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	Total interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $4.7 million, $5.1 million and $6.7 million, respectively.
898173_12_ITEM8_P31_S2	Notes receivable: The Company had notes receivable from vendors and other third parties amounting to $15.0 million and $22.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
898173_12_ITEM8_P31_S3	The notes receivable, which bear interest at rates ranging from 0% to 10%, are due in varying amounts through March of 2019.
898173_12_ITEM8_P31_S4	Interest income on notes receivable is recorded in accordance with the note terms to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected.
898173_12_ITEM8_P31_S5	The Company regularly reviews its notes receivable for collectability and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectable amounts based on an evaluation of the Company s borrowers financial positions and corresponding abilities to meet financial obligations.
898173_12_ITEM8_P31_S6	Management does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the Company will be unable to collect the notes receivable and the Company did not record a reserve for uncollectable notes receivable in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2011 or 2010.
898173_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Goodwill and other intangible assets: The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, include goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as the result of acquisitions.
898173_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually on November 30, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values, rather than systematically amortizing goodwill against earnings.
898173_12_ITEM8_P32_S2	During 2011 and 2010, the goodwill impairment test included a quantitative assessment, which compared the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill.
898173_12_ITEM8_P32_S3	The Company operates as a single reporting unit, and the Company determined that its fair value exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, at December 31, 2011 and 2010; as such, no goodwill impairment adjustment was required at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
898173_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	Self-insurance reserves: The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for Team Member health care benefits, workers compensation, vehicle liability, general liability and property loss.
898173_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, the Company obtains third-party insurance coverage to limit its exposure.
898173_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	Certain of these liabilities were recorded at their net present value discounted using the Company s incremental borrowing rate of 4.75% and 5.30% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
898173_12_ITEM8_P34_S2	The following table identifies the components of the Company s self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):
898173_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	The current portion of the Company s discounted self-insurance reserves totaled $53.2 million and $51.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
898173_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	The remainder was included within Other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
898173_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	Warranties: The Company offers warranties on the merchandise it sells with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties.
898173_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of the Company s vendors.
898173_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	Certain vendors provide upfront allowances to the Company in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims.
898173_12_ITEM8_P36_S3	For this merchandise, when sold, the Company bears the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims.
898173_12_ITEM8_P36_S4	Differences between vendor allowances received by the Company in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales.
898173_12_ITEM8_P36_S5	Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line.
898173_12_ITEM8_P36_S6	The Company s historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims to the Company has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims.
898173_12_ITEM8_P36_S7	See Note 8 for further information concerning the Company s aggregate product warranty liability.
898173_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	O Reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company s business.
898173_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Company records reserves for litigation losses in instances where a material adverse outcome is probable and the Company is able to reasonably estimate the probable loss.
898173_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	The Company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred on pending litigation matters.
898173_12_ITEM8_P37_S3	Although the Company cannot ascertain the total amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, the Company does not currently believe that in the aggregate, taking into account applicable insurance coverage, these matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	In addition, O Reilly is involved in resolving legacy governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against certain former CSK Automotive Corporation ( CSK ) employees arising out of alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the Company s acquisition of CSK.
898173_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	See Note 12 for further information concerning these legal matters.
898173_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	Closed property liabilities: The Company maintains reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations.
898173_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Company provides for these liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the close date, net of estimated sublease income.
898173_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	In conjunction with the acquisition of CSK, the Company s reserves include purchase accounting liabilities related to acquired properties that were no longer being utilized in the acquired business as well as the Company s planned exit activities.
898173_12_ITEM8_P39_S3	See Note 6 for further information concerning these closed store liabilities.
898173_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	Derivative instruments and hedging activities: The Company s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether the instruments meet the criteria for designation as cash flow or fair value hedges.
898173_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	The criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the assessment of the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction, matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction and the probability that the underlying transaction will occur.
898173_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	A designated hedge of the exposure to variability in the future cash flows of an asset or a liability qualifies as a cash flow hedge.
898173_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	A designated hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability qualifies as a fair value hedge.
898173_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	For derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation, the Company would recognize the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss and would reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same income statement line item as the impact of the hedged transaction.
898173_12_ITEM8_P41_S3	For derivatives with fair value hedge accounting designation, the Company would recognize gains or losses from the change in fair value of these derivatives, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item, in earnings.
898173_12_ITEM8_P41_S4	At December 31, 2011, the Company did not hold any instruments that qualified as cash flow or fair value hedge derivatives.
898173_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company held derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
898173_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Company designated these derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges.
898173_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	The derivative financial instruments were recorded at fair value and were included within Other current liabilities .
898173_12_ITEM8_P42_S3	On a quarterly basis, the Company measured the effectiveness of the derivative financial instruments by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest to be paid or received on the variable leg of the instruments against the expected future interest payments on the corresponding variable rate debt.
898173_12_ITEM8_P42_S4	In addition, the Company compared the critical terms, including notional amounts, underlying indices and reset dates of the derivative financial instruments with the respective variable rate debt to ensure all terms agreed.
898173_12_ITEM8_P42_S5	Any ineffectiveness was reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets to Interest expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
898173_12_ITEM8_P42_S6	See Note 7 for further information concerning these derivative instruments accounted for as hedges.
898173_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	Share repurchases: On January 11, 2011, the Company s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program.
898173_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	Under the program, the Company may, from time to time, repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.

898173_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	Generally, the lease term for stores is the base lease term and the lease term for DCs includes the base lease term plus certain renewal option periods for which renewal is reasonably assured and failure to exercise the renewal option would result in a significant economic penalty.
898173_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company s policy is to amortize leasehold improvements associated with the Company s operating leases over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated economic life of those assets.

898173_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	These debt issuance costs have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the corresponding debt issue and the amortization expense is included as a component of Interest expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income.
898173_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	Deferred debt issuance costs totaled $9.0 million and $21.6 million, net of amortization, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which $1.3 million and $8.6 million were included within Other current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, with the remainder included within Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
898173_12_ITEM8_P53_S3	All unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Company s asset-based revolving credit facility ( ABL Credit Facility ) were expensed on January 14, 2011, in conjunction with the issuance of the Company s $500 million of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ) and subsequent repayment and retirement of the ABL Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM8_P53_S4	See Note 5 for further information concerning the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 and the retirement of the ABL Credit Facility.
898173_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	Income taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.
898173_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the GAAP basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rules and rates currently scheduled to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
898173_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	Tax carry forwards are also recognized in deferred tax assets and liabilities under this method.
898173_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.
898173_12_ITEM8_P54_S4	The Company would record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not the amount will not be realized, based upon evidence available at the time of the determination and any change in the valuation allowance is recorded in the period of a change in such determination.
898173_12_ITEM8_P54_S5	The Company did not establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, as it was considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets were realizable through a combination of future taxable income, the realization of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies.
898173_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal period.
898173_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus, where applicable, the common stock equivalents associated with the potential impact of dilutive stock options or conversion of convertible debt.
898173_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	Certain common stock equivalents that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, were not included in the fully diluted computation because they would have been antidilutive.
898173_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Generally, stock options are antidilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation when the exercise price exceeds the market price of the common shares.
898173_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	See Note 15 for further information concerning these common stock equivalents.
898173_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	New accounting pronouncements: In May of 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( 2011-04 ).
898173_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	ASU 2011-04 was issued to bring the definition of fair value, the guidance for fair value measurement and the disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) in line with one another.
898173_12_ITEM8_P57_S2	ASU 2011-04 also enhances the disclosure requirements for changes and transfers within the valuation hierarchy levels, particularly valuations in Level 3 fair value measurements, and is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM8_P57_S3	The application of this guidance affects disclosures only and therefore, will not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	In June of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income ( 2011-05 ).
898173_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	ASU 2011-05 was issued to improve the comparability of financial reporting between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, and eliminates previous U.S. GAAP guidance that allowed an entity to present components of other comprehensive income ( OCI ) as part of its statement of changes in shareholders equity.
898173_12_ITEM8_P58_S2	With the issuance of ASU 2011-05, companies are now required to report all components of OCI either in a single continuous statement of total comprehensive income, which includes components of both OCI and net income, or in a separate statement appearing consecutively with the statement of income.
898173_12_ITEM8_P58_S3	ASU 2011-05 does not affect current guidance for the accounting of the components of OCI, or which items are included within total comprehensive income.
898173_12_ITEM8_P58_S4	In December of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 ( 2011-12 ).
898173_12_ITEM8_P58_S5	ASU 2011-12 defers changes in ASU 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments shown on the face of the financial statements.
898173_12_ITEM8_P58_S6	No other requirements of ASU 2011-05 were affected by the issuance of ASU 2011-12, including the requirement to report income either in a single continuous financial statement or in a separate statement of total comprehensive income, which is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
898173_12_ITEM8_P58_S7	The Company adopted this guidance with its 2011 financial statements; the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore, did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	In September of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment ( 2011-08 ).
898173_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	ASU 2011-08 was issued to simplify the impairment test of goodwill, by allowing entities to use a qualitative approach to determine whether goodwill impairment might exist, before completing the entire impairment test.
898173_12_ITEM8_P59_S2	Under ASU 2011-08, an entity has the option to first assess any qualitative factors that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
898173_12_ITEM8_P59_S3	The changes under ASU 2011-08 are effective for public companies for annual and interim testing performed for periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
898173_12_ITEM8_P59_S4	The application of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	NOTE 2 BUSINESS COMBINATION Effective July 11, 2008, the Company acquired CSK, which was one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the Western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count at the date of acquisition.
898173_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with O Reilly Automotive, Inc. as the acquiring entity in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141, Business Combinations .
898173_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	The purchase price to acquire CSK was $542.2 million and was finalized on June 30, 2009.
898173_12_ITEM8_P60_S3	The consideration paid by the Company to complete the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.
898173_12_ITEM8_P60_S4	The results of CSK s operations have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements since July 11, 2008, the acquisition date.
898173_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	NOTE 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company uses the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure the fair value of certain of its financial instruments.
898173_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
898173_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company uses the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities.
898173_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:
898173_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets.
898173_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable.
898173_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
898173_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	The Company did not have transfers between levels within the hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2011 or 2010.
898173_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: The fair value of the Company s outstanding interest rate swap contracts, as discussed in Note 5 and Note 7, was included in Other current liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010.
898173_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	The fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was based on the discounted net present value of the swaps using third party quotes (Level 2).
898173_12_ITEM8_P66_S2	Changes in fair market value were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and changes resulting from the termination of the interest rate swap contracts were recorded in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
898173_12_ITEM8_P66_S3	All of the interest rate swap contracts that existed as of December 31, 2010, were terminated at the Company s request on January 14, 2011, concurrent with the retirement of the ABL Credit Facility and the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021, as discussed in Note 5 and Note 7.
898173_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	$ (4,845 ) Non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: Certain long-lived non-financial assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in certain circumstances, including when there is evidence of impairment.
898173_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	These non-financial assets and liabilities may include assets acquired in a business combination or property and equipment that are determined to be impaired.
898173_12_ITEM8_P67_S2	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not have any non-financial assets or liabilities that had been measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
898173_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	Fair value of financial instruments: The carrying amounts of the Company s senior notes are included in Long-term debt, less current portion on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2011.
898173_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	The carrying amount of the Company s ABL Credit Facility as of December 31, 2010, was $356 million and was included in Long-term debt, less current portion on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at that time.
898173_12_ITEM8_P68_S2	The Company determined that the estimated fair value of its ABL Credit Facility approximated the carrying amount.
898173_12_ITEM8_P68_S3	This valuation was determined by consulting investment bankers (Level 2).
898173_12_ITEM8_P68_S4	All outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility were repaid on January 14, 2011, and the facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of the Company s 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 as discussed in Note 5.
898173_12_ITEM8_P68_S5	The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets include other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, amounts receivable from vendors and accounts payable.
898173_12_ITEM8_P68_S6	Due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments, the Company believes that the carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair values.
898173_12_ITEM8_P68_S7	NOTE 4 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES Goodwill:
898173_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	Goodwill is reviewed annually on November 30 for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in business conditions indicate that impairment may exist.
898173_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	Goodwill is not amortizable for financial statement purposes.
898173_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded a decrease in goodwill of less than $0.1 million, primarily due to adjustments to purchase price allocations related to small acquisitions and the excess tax benefit related to exercises of stock options acquired in the acquisition of CSK.

898173_12_ITEM8_P124_S1	It is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the Company s results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by an ultimate resolution of such matter, depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flows for such period.
898173_12_ITEM8_P124_S2	However, at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of the pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves should not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

898173_12_ITEM8_P125_S1	Generally, these lease agreements provide for renewal options for an additional five years at the option of the Company and the lease agreements are periodically modified to further extend the lease term for specific stores under the agreements (see Note 11).

898173_12_ITEM8_P125_S3	We believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.

898173_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its subsidiaries, collectively we , O Reilly or the Company , is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ( DIY ) and professional service provider customers, our dual market strategy .
898173_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	The business was founded in 1957 by Charles F. O'Reilly and his son, Charles H. ''Chub'' O'Reilly, Sr. and initially operated from a single store in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our common stock has traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ORLY since April 22, 1993.
898173_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	At the close of business on December 31, 2012, we completed an asset purchase of the auto-parts related assets of VIP Parts, Tires Service ( VIP ), which is a large privately held automotive parts, tires and service chain in New England, and operated 56 stores and one distribution center located throughout Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
898173_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	The acquired assets of VIP are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date.
898173_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	On December 29, 2010, we completed a corporate reorganization creating a holding company structure and during which O Reilly Automotive, Inc. was incorporated on December 27, 2010 , which was implemented through an agreement and plan of merger under Section 351.448 of The General Corporation Law of the State of Missouri, which did not require a vote of the shareholders.
898173_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	As a result of this reorganization, the previous parent company and registrant, O Reilly Automotive, Inc., was renamed O Reilly Automotive Stores, Inc. and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the new parent company and registrant, which was renamed O Reilly Automotive, Inc.
898173_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	On July 11, 2008, we acquired CSK Auto Corporation ( CSK ), which was one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count at the date of acquisition.
898173_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	At the date of the acquisition, CSK had 1,342 stores in 22 states, operating under four brand names: Checker Auto Parts, Schuck s Auto Supply, Kragen Auto Parts and Murray s Discount Auto Parts.
898173_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	The results of CSK s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.
898173_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	At December 31, 2012, we operated 3,976 stores in 42 states.
898173_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our stores carry an extensive product line, including the products identified below:
898173_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	accessories, such as floor mats, seat covers and truck accessories.
898173_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers, such as those identified below:
898173_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 1 4 for a description of certain risks relevant to our business.
898173_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	These risk factors include, among others, deteriorating economic conditions, the performance of acquired stores, increased debt levels, our acquisition strategies, competition in the automotive aftermarket business, our dependence upon key and other personnel, future growth assurance, our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, the effect of sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, our relationships with key vendors and availability of key products, a downgrade in our credit ratings, complications in our distribution centers ( DC s), and environmental legislation and other regulations.
898173_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy.
898173_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O Reilly values of customer service and expense control.
898173_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve, by providing superior customer service and significant value to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	We believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, strategic distribution systems and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages that cannot be easily duplicated.
898173_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Proven Ability to Execute a Dual Market Strategy:
898173_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Over the past 30 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage.
898173_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts, capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors, and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	In 2012, we derived approximately 59 % of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 41 % of our sales from our professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Prior to the acquisition of CSK, we derived approximately 50% of our sales from both our DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	As we continue to grow our commercial business in the acquired CSK markets, we expect that over time our DIY and professional service provider sales mix to approximate historical averages.
898173_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	As a result of our historical success of executing our dual market strategy and our over 470 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer, we believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional service provider customers and will continue to have a competitive advantage over our retail competitors who continue to derive a higher concentration of their sales from the DIY market.
898173_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	We seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below:
898173_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators.
898173_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard parts, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis.
898173_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People.
898173_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	We believe our commitment to a robust, regional , tiered distribution network provides for superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network.
898173_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes DCs and Hub stores.
898173_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management.
898173_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	We currently operate 24 regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 142,000 stock keeping units ( SKU s), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P16_S4	To augment our robust DC network, we operate 240 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to an average of 42,000 SKUs to other stores within the surrounding area .
898173_13_ITEM1_P16_S5	We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.
898173_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our Company philosophy is to promote from within and the vast majority of our senior management, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company.
898173_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience.
898173_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	We have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 146 professionals who average 18 years of service; 273 corporate managers who average 15 years of service; and 386 district managers who average 13 years of service.
898173_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	Our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 20 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993.
898173_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	We intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket.
898173_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	During 2012, we opened 180 net, new stores, acquired 56 stores and we plan to open approximately 190 net, new stores in 2013, which will increas e our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets.
898173_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O'Reilly stores.
898173_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	We typically open new stores either by (i) constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory, (ii) acquiring an independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store, or (iii) purchasing multi-store chains.
898173_13_ITEM1_P18_S4	New store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_13_ITEM1_P18_S5	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities, competing auto parts stores within a pre-determined radius, and the operational strength of such competitors.
898173_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network.
898173_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets.
898173_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_13_ITEM1_P19_S3	Consequently, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.
898173_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy.
898173_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O'Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability.
898173_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Although the automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, such as ourselves, to operate more efficiently and proficiently than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation.
898173_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	Thus, our intention is to continue to selectively pursue acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard into new markets.
898173_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Continually Enhance Store Design and Location:
898173_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our current prototype store design features enhancements such as optimized square footage, higher ceilings, more convenient interior store layouts, improved in-store signage, brighter lighting, increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance customer service.
898173_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	During 2012, we relocated 32 stores and renovated 70 stores.
898173_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best serve our customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Continually Enhance the Growth and Functionality of Our E-Commerce W ebsite:
898173_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our user-friendly website, www.oreillyauto.com , allows our customers to search product and repair content, check our in-store availability of products, and place orders for either home delivery or in-store pickup.
898173_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	We continue to enhance the functionality of our website to provide our customers with a friendly and convenient shopping experience, as well as a robust product and repair content information resource, that will continue to build the O Reilly Brand.
898173_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	As of January 31, 2013, we employed 53,615 Team Members (33,931 full-time Team Members and 19,684 part-time Team Members), of whom 45,180 were employed at our stores, 5,937 were employed at our DCs and 2,498 were employed at our corporate and regional offices.
898173_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	A union represents 49 stores (527 Team Members) in the Greater Bay Area in California, and has for many years.
898173_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	In addition, approximately 71 Team Members who drive over-the-road trucks in two of our DCs are represented by a labor union.
898173_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	Except for these Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions.
898173_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	Our tradition for 56 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our Live Green Culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member s contribution to the success of O Reilly.
898173_13_ITEM1_P29_S4	This focus on professionalism and fairness has created an industry-leading team and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent.
898173_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	As a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	Our stores, on average, carry approximately 23,500 SKUs and average approximately 7,200 total square feet in size.
898173_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	At December 31, 2012, we had a total of approximately 29 million square feet in our 3,976 stores.
898173_13_ITEM1_P30_S3	Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 142,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 240 Hub stores, which, on average, carry approximately 42,000 SKUs and average approximately 10,000 square feet in size.
898173_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	We believe that our stores are ''destination stores'' generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity.
898173_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings and prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares, and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	The following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of December 31, 2012 and 2011:
898173_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	We utilize a computer-assisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent retail merchandise presentation and customize our hard-parts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area.
898173_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	Front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access, maximum selling space and to prominently display high-turnover products and accessories to customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	To ensure the best customer experience possible, we have selectively implemented bilingual in-store signage based on the demographics in each store s geographic area.
898173_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Aisle displays and end caps are used to feature high-demand , seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.
898173_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	To enhance store-level operations, customer service and reliability, we use Linux servers and IBM I-Series computer systems in our stores.
898173_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	These systems are linked with the I-Series computers located in each of our DCs.
898173_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	Our point-of-sale system provide s immediate access to our electronic catalog , part images, schematics and pricing information by make, model and year of vehicle and use barcode scanning technology to price our merchandise.
898173_13_ITEM1_P35_S3	This system speeds transaction times, reduces the customer s checkout time, ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service.
898173_13_ITEM1_P35_S4	Moreover, our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management, strategic planning, inventory control and distribution efficiency.
898173_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are identified below:
898173_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	the type and size of store that should be developed.
898173_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale.
898173_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas.
898173_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.
898173_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store.
898173_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	Each of our 386 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores, which provides our stores with a strong amount of operational support.
898173_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Store and d istrict managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model.
898173_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	S tore and district managers also receive continuous training through on-line assignments, field workshops and regional meetings.
898173_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through incentive compensation programs.
898173_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	Under our incentive compensation programs, base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based upon their individual and/or store s sales and profitability.
898173_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	In addition, each of our district managers participate in our stock option program and store managers may be eligible for a quarterly bonus program based on their store s performance .
898173_13_ITEM1_P41_S3	We believe that our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store Team Members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.
898173_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	We believe our highly trained team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	Because a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly, technically proficient in automotive products.
898173_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from a Professional Parts Person, particularly when purchasing hard parts.
898173_13_ITEM1_P42_S3	The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.
898173_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	We screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs, or automotive aptitude.
898173_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company as well as the requirements for their specific job position.
898173_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O Reilly Certified Parts Professional test.
898173_13_ITEM1_P43_S4	Passing the O Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE).
898173_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	All of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with their regional field sales manager.
898173_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	Afterward, these Team Members spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P44_S3	Additionally, each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.
898173_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products.
898173_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	We believe that the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the specific automotive products requested.
898173_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	Accordingly, each O'Reilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications.
898173_13_ITEM1_P45_S3	We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management's assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.
898173_13_ITEM1_P45_S4	We have no material back orders for the products we sell.
898173_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our online ordering service provides enhanced customer service capabilities to our DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our program allows customers to view available parts and prices online, purchase parts online and/or either ship these purchases to their location or have these parts available for pick up in our local store.
898173_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	We believe that our tiered distribution model provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions, while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory.
898173_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	Moreover, we believe that our ongoing, significant capital investments made in our DC network allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network.
898173_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clus ters of stores located in the regions surrounding each DC.
898173_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	We currently have a total growth capacity of over 400 stores in our distribu tion center network , which will increase by 300 stores with the completion of our Lakeland, Florida DC in the first quarter of 2014 .
898173_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	We currently operate 24 DCs comprised of approximately 8.6 million operating square feet (see the Properties table in Ite m 2 of this Form 10-K for a detailed listing of DC operating square footages).
898173_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our DCs electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores.
898173_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our DCs stock an average of 142,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to multiple other regional DCs inventory.
898173_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to all of our stores in the continental United States.
898173_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	In addition, stores within a DC metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from our DC city counters , most of which receive this service seven days per week.
898173_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	In addition, our Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores.
898173_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	As part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2013 we plan to:
898173_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	make proven, return-on-investment based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs including conveyor systems, picking modules and lift equipment.
898173_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	We currently operate 240 strategically placed Hub stores.
898173_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis.
898173_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our Hub stores average approxima tely 10,000 square feet and carry an average of 42,000 SKU s.
898173_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of brand name , house brands and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks.
898173_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, BWD, Cardone, Castrol, Gates Rubber, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Quaker State, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix.
898173_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	In addition to name brand products, our stores carry a wide variety of high-quality house brands and private label products under our BestTest , BrakeBest , Import Direct , Master Pro , Micro-Gard , Murray , Omnispark , O Reilly Auto Parts , Precision , Power Torque , Super Start , and Ultima brands.
898173_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	Our house brand and private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value a characteristic important to our DIY customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	We have no long-term contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts.
898173_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	We believe that alternative supply sources exist at substantially similar costs, for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell.
898173_13_ITEM1_P54_S2	It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors.
898173_13_ITEM1_P54_S3	Again in 2012, we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases.
898173_13_ITEM1_P54_S4	As a whole, we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good.
898173_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500 vendors, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 25 % of our total purchases in 2012.
898173_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our largest vendor in 2012 accounted for approximately 8 % of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for approximately 3 % to 5 % of such purchases.
898173_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	We use an integrated marketing program, which includes television, radio, direct mail and newspaper distribution, in-store and online promotions, and sports and event sponsorships to aggressively attract DIY customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	The marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the O Reilly Brand across our geographic footprint.
898173_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	We utilize a combination of brand and product/price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases, which frequently coincide with key sales events.
898173_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	To stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts, who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public, we sponsored multiple nationally-televised races and over 1,500 grassroots, local, and regional motorsports events throughout 38 states during 2012.
898173_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	National series events in Texas and five National Hot Rod Association ( NHRA ) races from C alifornia to N orth Carolina.
898173_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	During the fall and winter months, we strategically sponsor National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) basketball and the National Football League ( NFL ).
898173_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	Our relationships with over 50 NCAA teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently-displayed O Reilly logos on TV-visible signs throughout the season.
898173_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	Through an expanded use of Spanish language radio, print, and outdoor advertising , as well as sponsorships of over 45 local and regional festivals and events, we demonstrated our commitment to increasing marketing efforts that are targeted toward the Hispanic auto parts consumer.
898173_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	In 2012, we continued our dedicated problem/solution communication strategy, which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance as a way to save money and protect their automotive investment over the long-term.
898173_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	This highly relevant message resonates with consumers and establishes O Reilly as their source for the parts they need and excellent customer service.
898173_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Marketing to the Professional Service Provider Customer:
898173_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	We have over 470 full-time O Reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our First Call program.
898173_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	Each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon, selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	Targeted marketing materials such as flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers, paint and body shops and fleet customers.
898173_13_ITEM1_P62_S3	Our industry-leading First Call program enables our sales representatives, district managers, and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services identified below:
898173_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	Marketing to the Independently Owned Parts Store:
898173_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	Along with the daily operation and management of the DCs and the distribution of automotive products to our stores, Ozark Automotive Distributors, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary ( Ozark ), also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores ( jobber stores ) throughout our trade areas.
898173_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	These jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an O'Reilly store.
898173_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	Ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores.
898173_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	Approximately 185 jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from Ozark and participate in our Parts City Auto Parts program, our proprietary jobber service program.
898173_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	As a participant in these programs, a jobber store, which meets certain financial and operational standards, is permitted to indicate its Parts City Auto Parts membership through the display of the respective logo that is owned by Ozark.
898173_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	In return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from Ozark, we provide computer software for business management, competitive pricing, advertising, marketing and sales assistance to Parts City Auto Parts affiliate stores.
898173_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	We believe that a competitive pricing policy is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business.
898173_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	Product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing policies of competitors in the market area served by each store.
898173_13_ITEM1_P68_S2	Most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of competitor price comparisons and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at a discount to the manufacturer s suggested retail price with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing.
898173_13_ITEM1_P68_S3	Consistent with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any in-stock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area.
898173_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our stores accept cash, checks, debit and credit cards.
898173_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	We also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our pre-established credit requirements.
898173_13_ITEM1_P69_S2	Some of the factors considered in our pre-established credit requirements include customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_13_ITEM1_P69_S3	No customer accounted for ten percent or more of our consolidated net sales, nor do we have any dependence on any single customer.
898173_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	We accept product returns for new products, core products and warranty/defective products.
898173_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	The automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light- and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale.
898173_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	The total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $ 231 billion, according to the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ).
898173_13_ITEM1_P71_S2	This market is made up of four segments labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales and tire sales.
898173_13_ITEM1_P71_S3	Reilly s addressable market within this industry is approximately $ 131 billion, which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and DIY sales.
898173_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations.
898173_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market.
898173_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	We compete primarily with the stores identified below:
898173_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout and convenient and accessible store locations.
898173_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	Our dual market strategy requires significant capital expenditures to support, such as the capital expenditures required for the distribution network, store network and inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.
898173_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	We have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	To the extent our acquisition cost increases due to base commodity price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_13_ITEM1_P75_S2	As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
898173_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	To some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Store sales, profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, including those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.
898173_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our oil and battery recycling programs.
898173_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party vendors.
898173_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates, deposited into vendor-supplied containers and pallets, and then disposed of by the third-party vendors.
898173_13_ITEM1_P79_S3	In general, our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the vendor.
898173_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date.
898173_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	We cannot give any assurance, however, that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.
898173_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	The following paragraphs discuss information about our executive officers who are not also directors:
898173_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	Greg Henslee , age 52 , President and Chief Executive Officer, has been an O Reilly Team Member for 28 years.
898173_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	O Reilly career started as a parts specialist, and during his first five years he served in several positions in retail store operations, including district manager.
898173_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	From there he advanced to Computer Operations Manager, and over the next 15 years, he served as Director of Computer Operations/Loss Prevention, Vice President of Store Operations and as Senior Vice President.
898173_13_ITEM1_P83_S2	In 1999, he became President of Merchandise, Distribution, Information Systems and Loss Prevention, and in 2005, he became Chief Executive Officer and Co-President.

898173_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unawa re, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission co uld have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deteriorating e conomic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In recent years, w orldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions, including the United States, and such conditions may worsen in the foreseeable future.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Many of these factors are outside of our control.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our customers purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the U.S., the total number of registered vehicles the U.S., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the U.S.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Also , the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Both the DIY and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Some of our competitors are l arger than we are and have greater financial resources.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, some of our competit ors are smaller than we are , but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	For a list of our principal competitors, see the Competition section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	O ur business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our cu stomers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to DIY customers.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, our stores and DCs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We cannot assure future growth will be achieved.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our a bility to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 201 3 and beyond will be achieved.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	For a discussion of our growth strategies, see the Growth Strategy section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense .
898173_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which cou ld cause us to be less efficient, and as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P13_S6	For a discussion of our management, see the Business section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect ou r financial health.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors' ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	For example, financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors, and could lead to les s competition and result in higher prices.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following:
898173_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, the subsequent owner or operator, may be liable.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, operability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters or the threat of them, may result in the closure of our distribution centers ( DC s) or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	This may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or other catastrophic events.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business .
898173_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We believe our Company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse affects on our business or Team Members.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	All of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amende d, subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We cannot predict the effect, if any, which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perce ption that such sale s might occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, could affect our stock price.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	If our quarterly operating results fa il to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of acquired businesses will be successful or that they will successfull y meet the expectati ons of these analysts.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our business would likely suffer.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our bus iness.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We have in place , a n un secured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	For example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things :
898173_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	expos e us to fluctuations in interest rates.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In addition, the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative and negative covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees .
898173_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	A downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive vendor financing programs.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The evaluations are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates .
898173_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	A downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P38_S4	A downgrade could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our notes, preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P38_S5	In addition, a downgrade could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our vendor financing programs at attractive rates.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Decreased participation in our vendor financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flow.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	A breach of customer , Team Member or C ompany information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and Team Member s.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing , and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches , and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition .
898173_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	L itigation, governmental proceedings , environmental legislation and regulations and employment laws and regulations may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings , arising out of the ordinary course of our business.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition .
898173_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Environmental legislation and regulations, like the i nitiativ es to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change , could a dversely impact all industries.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, including, among other things, increasing fuel prices.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our business is subject to employment laws and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and to look for opportunities to reduce costs.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P46_S3	A violation of or change in such laws and/or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by Congress and state legislators , could significantly impact our healthcare cost structure and increase our healthcare -related expenses .
898173_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We are currently evaluating the potential impact the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate the impacts , including potential modifications to our current benefit plans, operational changes to minimize the impact of the legislation to our cost structure and increases to selling prices to mitigate the expected increase in healthcare-related expenses.
898173_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	I f we cannot effectively modify our programs and operations in response to the new legislation , our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.
898173_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	We currently operate 24 regional distribution centers ( DC s).
898173_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we leased nine DCs ( 2.9 million operating square footage) and owned 15 DCs ( 5.7 million operating square footage) for total DC square footage of 8.6 million.
898173_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	The following table provides information regarding our DCs, returns facilities and corporate offices as of December 31, 2012:
898173_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	Of the 24 DCs that we operated at December 31, 2012, 15 were owned and nine were leased.
898173_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	The leased facilities typically require a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expense and have an original term of, at a minimum, 20 years, subject to one five-year renewal at our option.
898173_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	One of our bulk facilities is leased from an entity owned by an affiliated director s immediate family.
898173_13_ITEM2_P1_S3	This lease requires payment of a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of 15 years, subject to three five-year renewals at our option.
898173_13_ITEM2_P1_S4	We believe that this lease agreement with the affiliated entity is on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.
898173_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	Of the 3,976 stores that we operated at December 31, 2012, 1,359 stores were owned, 2,540 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 77 stores were leased from entities in which certain of our affiliated directors, members of our affiliated director s immediate family, or our executive officers, are affiliated.
898173_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	Leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of, at a minimum, 10 years, subject to one or more renewals at our option.
898173_13_ITEM2_P2_S2	We have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby.
898173_13_ITEM2_P2_S3	Such master lease agreements with two of the eight affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores.
898173_13_ITEM2_P2_S4	The master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from March 31, 2013, to September 30, 2031.
898173_13_ITEM2_P2_S5	We believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.
898173_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	We believe that our present facilities are in good condition, are adequately insured and are adequate for the conduct of our current operations.
898173_13_ITEM2_P3_S1	The store servicing capability of our 24 existing DCs is approximately 4,425 stores, providing a growth capacity of more than 400 st ores , which will increase by 300 stores with the completion of our Lakeland, Florida, DC, which is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2014 and provide distribution system support for store growth into southern Florida.
898173_13_ITEM2_P3_S2	We believe the growth capacity in our 24 existing DCs, along with the additional capacity of our new Lakeland, Florida , DC will provide us with the DC infrastructure needed for near-term expansion .
898173_13_ITEM2_P3_S3	However, as we expand our geographic footprint, we will continue to evaluate our existing distribution system infrastructure and will adjust our distribution system capacity as needed to support our future growth.
898173_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	O Reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company s business.
898173_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Company records reserves for litigation losses in instances where a material adverse outcome is probable and the Company is able to reasonably estimate the probable loss.
898173_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	The Company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred in pending litigation matters.
898173_13_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, it does not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters, taking into account applicable insurance and reserves, will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.
898173_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	In addition, O Reilly was involved in resolving governmental investigations that were being conducted against CSK and CSK s former officers and other litigation, prior to its acquisition by O Reilly, as described below.
898173_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	As previously reported, the governmental investigations of CSK regarding its legacy pre-acquisition accounting practices have concluded.
898173_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	All criminal charges against former employees of CSK related to its legacy pre-acquisition accounting practices, as well as the civil litigation filed against CSK s former Chief Executive Officer by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), have concluded.
898173_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	Under Delaware law, the charter documents of the CSK entities and certain indemnification agreements, CSK may have certain indemnification obligations.
898173_13_ITEM3_P3_S1	As a result of the CSK acquisition, O Reilly has incurred legal fees and costs related to these potential indemnification obligations arising from the litigation commenced by the Department of Justice and SEC against CSK s former employees.
898173_13_ITEM3_P3_S2	Whether those legal fees and costs are covered by CSK s insurance is subject to uncertainty, and, given its complexity and scope, the final outcome cannot be predicted at this time.
898173_13_ITEM3_P3_S3	Reilly has a remaining reserve, with respect to the indemnification obligations of $ 13.7 million at December 31, 2012, which relates to the payment of those legal fees and costs already incurred.
898173_13_ITEM3_P4_S0	It is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the Company s results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by resolution of such matter, depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flows for such period.
898173_13_ITEM3_P4_S1	However, at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter, after consideration of applicable reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

898173_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States.
898173_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ( DIY ) and professional service provider customer s.
898173_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment.
898173_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer.
898173_13_ITEM7_P5_S4	For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good , better , and best alternatives.
898173_13_ITEM7_P5_S5	Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products.
898173_13_ITEM7_P5_S6	Consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry.
898173_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	As of December 31, 201 2, we operated 3,976 stores in 42 states.
898173_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits and competition.
898173_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact O Reilly and the retail sector in general.
898173_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	We believe that the average consumer s tendency has been to trade-down to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions.
898173_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of purchasing up on the value spectrum.
898173_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	We believe these ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products will result in our customers willingness to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers; however, we cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change.
898173_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.
898173_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.
898173_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Historically, the long-term trend in the total miles driven in the U.S. has steadily increased; however, according to the Department of Transportation, total miles driven in the U.S. have remained relatively flat since 2007 as the U.S. has experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions.
898173_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	We believe that as the U.S. economy recovers and the level of unemployment declines, annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to drive demand f or the industry.
898173_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the U.S. vehicle population also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive afterm arket industry.
898173_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ), the total number of registered vehicles has increase d 15 % ov er the past decade, from 209 million light vehicles in 2001 to 241 million light vehicles in 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	A nnual new light vehicle registrations, have declined 24 % over the past decade, from 17 million registrations in 2001 to 13 million registrations in 2011; however, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (the SAAR ) of sales of light vehicles in the U.S. increased to 15 million as of December 31, 2012, indicating that the trend of declining new light vehicle registrations has reversed.
898173_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	As reported by the AAIA, vehicle scrappage rates have decreased 23% from 2001 to 2011, while the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased 21 % over th at decade , from 8.9 years in 2001 to 10.8 y ears in 2011 .
898173_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	We believe this decrease in vehicle scrappage rates and increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors , and the consumer s willingness to invest in maintaining their higher-mileage, better built vehicles.
898173_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty.
898173_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures a nd generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles.
898173_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Based on this change in consumer sentiment surrounding the length of time older vehicles can be reliably driven at higher mileages, we believe consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer as the economy recovers maintaining the trend of an aging vehicle population.
898173_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Unemployment - Unemployment rates and continued uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending.
898173_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The annual U.S. unemployment rate over the past two years has remained at 30-year highs.
898173_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	We believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money, which can be an important factor in the consumer s decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle and maintain their existing vehicle.
898173_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	While the deferral of vehicle purchases has led to an increase in vehicle maintenance, long-term trends of high unemployment could continue to impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased sli ghtly to 7.8 % fr om 8.5% as of December 31, 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	We believe that as the economy recovers, unemployment will return to more historic levels and we will see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work.
898173_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	Aided by these increased commuter miles, overall annual U.S. miles driven should begin to grow resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O Reilly values of customer service and expense control.
898173_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:
898173_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Under the Company s share repurchase program, as approved by the Board of Directors in January of 2011 , the Company may, from time to time , repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	The Company and its Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	The Company s Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $ 500 million on each of June 1, 2012, August 10, 2012, and November 12, 2012, raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to $ 3.0 billion.
898173_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	The additional $ 500 million authorizati ons are effective for a 3-year period, and the most recent authorization expires on November 12, 2015.
898173_13_ITEM7_P18_S4	As of February 28, 2013, we had repurchased approximately 34.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $2.6 billion un der this program.
898173_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	At the close of business on December 31, 2012, the Company completed the purchase of the auto-parts-related assets of VIP Parts, Tires Service ( VIP ).
898173_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The asset purchase included 56 stores located throughout Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, as well as a distribution center located in Lewiston, Maine.
898173_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:
898173_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased $ 393 million to $ 6.18 billion from $ 5.79 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 3.8 % and 4.6 % for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
898173_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members.
898173_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 (in millions):
898173_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Tea m Member s that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2012, was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decrease in DIY customer transaction counts.
898173_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The improvement in average ticket values was a result of the continued growth of the more costly , hard part categories, as a percentage of our total sales.
898173_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	The growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider customer sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in DIY hard part sales, as consumers continue to maintain and repair their vehicles.
898173_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	The strong increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts, driven by our acquired markets, have been offset by pressured DIY transaction counts.
898173_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	DIY customer transaction counts continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic pressures on disposable income, including sustained unemployment levels above historical averages.
898173_13_ITEM7_P24_S5	Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, which have been manufactured in recent years.
898173_13_ITEM7_P24_S6	These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the repair is typically greater.
898173_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	We opened 180 net, new stores and acquired 56 stores during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 170 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	At December 31, 2012, we operated 3,976 stores in 42 states compared to 3,740 stores in 39 states at December 31, 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 190 net, new stores in 201 3 .
898173_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $ 3.10 billion (or 50.1 % of sales) from $ 2.84 billion (or 49.0 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increases in sales from new stores and the increases in comparable store sales at existing stores.
898173_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to distribution center ( DC ) efficiencies, acquisition cost improvements and improved inventory shrinkage, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of the total sales mix.
898173_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	DC efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs.
898173_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	In addition, during 2012 we increased our store-level inventories as a component of our focus on providing higher service levels.
898173_13_ITEM7_P26_S5	The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores were more efficient than routine restocking activity and, as a result, we realized a one-time benefit from capitalized distribution costs.
898173_13_ITEM7_P26_S6	This capitalization of costs benefited gross margin by approximately 20 basis points versus the prior year, however, we do not anticipate realizing this excess benefit in future periods.
898173_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs.
898173_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	The improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks.
898173_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers, therefore, creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales.
898173_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $ 2.12 billion (or 34.3 % of sales) from $ 1.97 billion (or 34.1 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count.
898173_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	The slight increase in SG A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of our focus on store staffing levels to continue to deliver industry-leading customer service while adjusting to the slower sales environment, as well as an overall deleverage on soft comparable store sales.
898173_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	As a result of the impacts discussed above, o perating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $ 977 million (or 15.8 % of sales) from $ 867 million (or 15.0 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, de creased to $ 36 million (or 0.6 % of sales), from $ 51 million (or 0.9 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing a decrease of 30 % .
898173_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	The decrease in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, was primarily due to one-time charges related to our financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), partially offset by increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as compared to the prior year.
898173_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $ 356 million ( 37.8 % effective tax rate) from $ 308 million ( 37.8 % effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15 % .
898173_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income.
898173_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $ 586 million (or 9.5 % of sales), from $ 508 million (or 8.8 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 28 % to $ 4.75 on 123 million shares from $ 3.71 on 137 million shares for the same period one year ago.
898173_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	The impact of share repurchases during 2012 on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately $ 0.26 .
898173_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events:
898173_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK for SEC purposes , of $ 3 million ($ 2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer.
898173_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	This clawback amount was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $ 22 million ($ 13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $ 4 million ($ 3 million, net of tax).
898173_13_ITEM7_P36_S4	The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in Other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P36_S5	The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table.
898173_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 13 % to $ 977 million (or 15.8 % of sales) from $ 864 million (or 14.9 % of sales) for the same period one year ago.
898173_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 12 % to $ 586 million (or 9.5 % of sales) from $ 522 million (or 9.0 % of sales) for the same period one year ago.
898173_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 25 % to $ 4.75 from $ 3.81 for the same period one year ago.
898173_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	The financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
898173_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, and the former CSK officer clawback, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations.
898173_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_13_ITEM7_P38_S4	Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_13_ITEM7_P38_S5	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Sales for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased $ 391 million to $ 5.79 billion from $ 5.40 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.6 % and 8.8 % for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
898173_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members.
898173_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 (in millions):
898173_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	Our comparable store sales increase for the year was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decline in customer transaction counts.
898173_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the continued growth of the higher priced, hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales, and the impact of increased raw material acquisition costs, which were passed through to increased selling prices during the period.
898173_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	The growth in the hard part categories was driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and a shift in DIY sales to the hard part categories.
898173_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	During the year, DIY customer transaction counts were negatively impacted by the continued pressure on disposable income that our customers faced as a result of increased fuel costs and sustained unemployment levels above historical averages, which offset strong increases in professional service provider transaction counts.
898173_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	We opened 170 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 149 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2010.
898173_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	At December 31, 2011, we operated 3,740 stores in 39 states compared to 3,570 stores in 38 states at December 31, 2010.
898173_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 2.84 billion (or 49.0 % of sales) from $ 2.62 billion (or 48.6 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores.
898173_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable product mix, improved acquisition costs, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution center efficiencies, partially offset by the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of the total sales mix.
898173_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	The improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a high gross profit as a percentage of sales.
898173_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	Increasing hard part sales is the result of strong demand as consumers retain and maintain their vehicles beyond manufacturer warranty periods and our strong growth in sales to professional service providers in the acquired markets.
898173_13_ITEM7_P43_S5	The improved shrinkage wa s driven by our converted CSK stores, which are now managed using the O Reilly point-of-sale system ( POS ), installed in all CSK stores as they converted to the O Reilly distribution systems throughout 2009 and 2010.
898173_13_ITEM7_P43_S6	The O Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory, resulting in improved inventory shrinkage.
898173_13_ITEM7_P43_S7	Distribution center efficiencies we re the result of leverage on increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced distribution center Team Members in our newer DCs.
898173_13_ITEM7_P43_S8	Professional service provider sales in the acquired CSK markets grew at a faster rate than total DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in those markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy.
898173_13_ITEM7_P43_S9	Professional service provider sales typically carry a lower overall gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service providers, consequently creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales.
898173_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 1.97 billion (or 34.1 % of sales) from $ 1.89 billion (or 35.0 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 5 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count.
898173_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy and headquarters costs on strong comparable store sales, improved store payroll efficiencies and positive trends related to health benefits, partially offset by increased fuel costs for our store delivery vehicles supporting our growing commercial business.
898173_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 867 million (or 15.0 % of sales) from $ 713 million (or 13.2 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 22 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase in operating income during the year was primarily due to the impacts discussed above, as well as $ 3 million of nonrecurring income in the current year related to a settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and a forme r CSK of ficer that resulted in the reimbursement to CSK of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer (discussed in detail below see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements) versus a $21 million charge to operating income in the prior year, related to the previously announced legacy United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) investigation of CSK (discussed in detail below see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
898173_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG A from strong comparable store sales.
898173_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 51 million (or 0.9 % of sales), from $ 23 million (or 0.4 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 118 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase in total other expense for the year was primarily due to one-time charges related to our new financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), offset by decreased interest expense on a lower average interest rate on outstanding borrowings, a lower facility fee on our revolving credit facility and less amortization of debt issuance costs in the current period as compared to the borrowing rates, facility fee and amortization of debt issuance costs in the prior period.
898173_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	In addition, during 2010, we recognized a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $ 12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK (discussed in detail below).
898173_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 308 million ( 37.8 % effective tax rate) from $ 270 million ( 39.2 % effective tax rate) for the same period in the prior year , representing an increase of 14 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income.
898173_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	The decrease in the effective rate was primarily the result of the $ 21 million charge recorded in 2010 related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation, discussed in detail below, which was not deductible for tax purposes.
898173_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 508 million (or 8.8 % of sales), from $ 419 million (or 7.8 % of sales) for the same period in the prior year , representing an increase of 21 %.
898173_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 26 % to $ 3.71 on 137 million shares from $ 2.95 on 142 million shares for the same period in the prior year .
898173_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	The impact of share repurchases during 2011 on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately $ 0.19 .
898173_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events:
898173_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK for SEC purposes , of $ 3 million ($ 2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer.
898173_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	This clawback amount was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $ 22 million ($ 13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $ 4 million ($ 3 million, net of tax).
898173_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in Other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P51_S5	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010, included a nonrecurring, non-operating gain in Other income (expense) of $ 12 million ($ 7 million, net of tax) related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the CSK acquisition, as well as a charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation into CSK s pre-acquisition historical accounting practices.
898173_13_ITEM7_P51_S6	We accrued $ 21 million during 2010 in anticipation of executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement ( NPA ) among the DOJ, CSK and O Reilly and paying a one-time monetary penalty of $ 21 million.
898173_13_ITEM7_P51_S7	During the third quarter of 2011, the NPA was executed and the previously recorded, one-time $ 21 million penalty was paid to the DOJ on behalf of CSK.
898173_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	investigation was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2010.
898173_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table.
898173_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 18 % to $ 864 million (or 14.9 % of sales) from $ 734 million (or 13.6 % of sales) for the same period one year ago.
898173_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 21 % to $ 522 million (or 9.0 % of sales) from $ 433 million (or 8.0 % of sales) for the same period in the prior year .
898173_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 25 % to $ 3.81 from $ 3.05 for the same period in the prior year .
898173_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	The financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
898173_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, the former CSK officer clawback, the charges for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation and the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations.
898173_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_13_ITEM7_P54_S4	Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_13_ITEM7_P54_S5	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program.
898173_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility .
898173_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations.
898173_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility .
898173_13_ITEM7_P55_S4	We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
898173_13_ITEM7_P55_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels.
898173_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in millions):
898173_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	(1) Quick assets include cash, cash equivalents and receivables.
898173_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	(2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.
898173_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	(3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities.
898173_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	(4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities.
898173_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	(5) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by shareholders equity.
898173_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Current liabilities increased 44%, t otal de bt increased 37% and total equity decreased 26% from 2011 to 2012.
898173_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing program and the additional vendor participation during the year.
898173_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 84.7% as of December 31, 2012, as compared to 64.4% one year prior.
898173_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of our unsecured $300 million 3.800% Senior Notes during 2012.
898173_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year and an increase in additional paid-in-capital from the proceeds of stock option exercises, and related tax benefits, executed under our director and employee share-based compensation plans.
898173_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):
898173_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges and the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011), decreases in net inventory investment and other assets and increases in income taxes payable (adjusted for the effect of non-cash change in deferred income taxes and the excess tax benefit from stock options exercised) and other current liabilities.
898173_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors.
898173_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs.
898173_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	Our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors.
898173_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 84.7% and 64.4% at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
898173_13_ITEM7_P66_S4	The decrease in other assets was primarily the result of the timing of payments from vendors for receivables due to the Company under various programs.
898173_13_ITEM7_P66_S5	The increase in income taxes payable, adjusted for the non-cash impacts discussed above, was primarily the result of the prepayment of income taxes during 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	liabilities was primarily the result of the payment, during 2011, for the one-time monetary penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation.
898173_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	Th e increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 wa s primarily due to strong net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011 and deferred income taxes) and a significant decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in other current liabilities (driven by the payment of the one-time penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation).
898173_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Our net inventory investment significantly decreased as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs as well as our ongoing efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems.
898173_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 64.4% and 44.3% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
898173_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	Our efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems resulted in a decrease in total inventory of $37 million during the year, despite the fact that we opened 170 new stores during the year.
898173_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures during 2012, partially offset by small acquisitions during the year.
898173_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	Total c apital expenditures were $ 301 million, $ 328 million, and $ 365 million in 2012, 2011, and 20 10, respectively .
898173_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	The decrease in capital expenditures during 2012, as compared to 2011, was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased stores opened.
898173_13_ITEM7_P69_S3	We were able to find real estate with attractive lease factors during 2012 and as a result, opened a larger number of leased locations during 2012 as compared to the year prior.
898173_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Opening a new store in a leased location requires a smaller capital investment than opening an owned location.
898173_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures.
898173_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	During 2010, we completed the comprehensive expansion of our distribution system in the CSK markets and the conversion of the CSK stores to the O Reilly POS, resulting in reduced levels of conversion related capital expenditures during 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	We opened 180 , 170 , and 149 net, new stores in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively , and acquired 56 stores in 2012 .
898173_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	We plan to open 190 net, new stores in 2013.
898173_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $ 1.7 million to $ 1.9 million ; however, suc h costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site .
898173_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2012, in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program and greater net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during 2011, partially offset by an increase in the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under the Company s incentive programs and the related tax benefits during 2012.
898173_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2011 in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program, which was partially offset by an increase in net long term borrowings in 2011 as compared to net repayments under our facilities during 2010.
898173_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	The net borrowings in 2011 are the result of proceeds from the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 and our 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 in January and September of 2011, respectively, partially offset by the repayment and termination of our previous ABL Credit Facility and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the issuance of our senior notes and the establishment of our new unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	The net repayments under our facilities in 2010 were the result of our focus on using available cash on hand to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings under our secured ABL Credit Facility.
898173_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $ 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility ) arranged by BA and Barclays Capital, which was scheduled to mature in January of 2016.
898173_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	During 2011, we amended the unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which decreased the facility to $ 660 million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	The amendment also extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to September of 2016.
898173_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	In conjunction with the amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of $ 0.3 million, which is included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $ 200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $ 75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings.
898173_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	As described in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $ 200 million.
898173_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	We had stand-by letters of credit, primarily to satisfy workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $ 57 million and $ 60 million as of December 13, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
898173_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	On July 11, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in July of 2013.
898173_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	which $ 106 million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract.
898173_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	All outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility were repaid, and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on January 14, 2011, and the ABL Credit Facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our 4.875 % Senior Notes due 2021, as further described below.
898173_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	In conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $ 22 million and a one-time charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of $ 4 million, which are included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875 % Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ) at a price to the public of 99.297 % of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. ( UMB ) as trustee.
898173_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, which began on July 14, 2011, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.

898173_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	On August 21, 2012, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.800 % Senior Notes due 2022 ( 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 ) at a price to the public of 99.627 % of their face value with UMB as trustee.
898173_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	Interest on the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.
898173_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	The net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering, with the remainder intended to be used to repay borrowings outstanding from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases.
898173_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries ( Subsidiary Guarantors ) that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our Revolving C redit F acility or certain of our other debt or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors.
898173_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the subsidiary guarantor s guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sales or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all of the property of, the subsidiary guarantor .
898173_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries.
898173_13_ITEM7_P83_S3	Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries.
898173_13_ITEM7_P83_S4	Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law.
898173_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31 , 201 2 .
898173_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures.
898173_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.
898173_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	The Credit Agreement contains covenants, including limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility , a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.0 0 times through December 31, 2012; 2.25 times through December 31, 2014; 2.5 0 times through maturity; and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 3. 0 0 times through maturity.
898173_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock option compensation expense ( EBITDAR ) to adjusted debt.
898173_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt.
898173_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken against us, including but not limited to possible termination of credit extensions, immediate payment of outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and litigation from our lenders.
898173_13_ITEM7_P87_S3	We had a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.95 times and 4.86 times as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio of 1.83 times and 1.75 times as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.
898173_13_ITEM7_P87_S4	Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio range of 2. 0 0 times to 2.25 times.
898173_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	The table below outlines the calculations of the fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
898173_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	The fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
898173_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	We believe that the presentation of our fixed charge coverage ratio, adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR and free cash flow provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement.
898173_13_ITEM7_P89_S3	We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_13_ITEM7_P89_S4	Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_13_ITEM7_P89_S5	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	Under our share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	We may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	During 2012, our Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the cumulative authorization amount to $ 3.0 billion.
898173_13_ITEM7_P90_S3	The most recent $ 500 million authorization is effective for a three-year period and expires November 12, 2015.
898173_13_ITEM7_P90_S4	Each prior $500 million authorization was effective for a three-year period beginning on the date of the additional authorization.

898173_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Subsequent to the end of the year and through the date of this filing, we repurchased an add itional 2.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of $ 90.09 for a total investment of $ 186 million.
898173_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	We have repurchased a total of 34.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 through and including February 28, 2013, at an average price of $ 76.37 for a total aggregate investment of $ 2.6 billio n.

898173_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	We expect to fund these commitments pri marily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility .
898173_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	Deferred income taxes , which is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory , are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment s cancellation terms.
898173_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 201 3 , which are included in Current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
898173_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $660 million and matures in September of 2016 , bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.975 % to 1.6 00% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.
898173_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	000 % to 0.6 00% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services , subject to limited exceptions .
898173_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above.
898173_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.150% to 0.400% based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services , subject to limited exceptions .
898173_13_ITEM7_P96_S2	Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans is 0.200%, our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 1.200% and our facility fee is 0.175% .
898173_13_ITEM7_P96_S3	As of December 31, 2012, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year.
898173_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payment s.
898173_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits.
898173_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount.
898173_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities, however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.

898173_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined.
898173_13_ITEM7_P100_S2	As of December 31, 201 2 , we recorded a liability of $ 59 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of Other liabilities .
898173_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	Off - balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the enti ty that is not recorded in our c onsolidated financial statements.
898173_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.
898173_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $ 200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility .
898173_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	Th o s e letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies.
898173_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance.
898173_13_ITEM7_P103_S3	Letters of credit totaling $ 57 million and $ 60 million were outstanding at December 31, 201 2 and 20 11 , respectively.
898173_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
898173_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	See Contractual Obligations and N ote 11 C ommitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our operating leases.
898173_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management.
898173_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
898173_13_ITEM7_P105_S2	Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates.
898173_13_ITEM7_P105_S3	Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP.
898173_13_ITEM7_P105_S4	However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.
898173_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal.
898173_13_ITEM7_P106_S2	The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population.
898173_13_ITEM7_P106_S3	We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand.
898173_13_ITEM7_P106_S4	We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost.
898173_13_ITEM7_P106_S5	This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods.
898173_13_ITEM7_P106_S6	Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances.
898173_13_ITEM7_P106_S7	We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future.
898173_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink.
898173_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and DCs.
898173_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances.
898173_13_ITEM7_P107_S3	We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates.
898173_13_ITEM7_P107_S4	If unrecorded shrink changed 10 % from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1 % of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012.
898173_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business.
898173_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors.
898173_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	Actual results have consistently been within management s expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts.
898173_13_ITEM7_P108_S3	However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains.
898173_13_ITEM7_P108_S4	If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10 % from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1 % of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 201 2 .
898173_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when ever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment.
898173_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset.
898173_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	The estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations.
898173_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.
898173_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets.
898173_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment.
898173_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter , or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	We have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill.
898173_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach.
898173_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value.
898173_13_ITEM7_P114_S3	In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 201 2 , nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing.
898173_13_ITEM7_P114_S4	If the price of O Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10 % from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.
898173_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	Vendor C oncessions We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates.
898173_13_ITEM7_P115_S1	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_13_ITEM7_P115_S2	All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory.
898173_13_ITEM7_P115_S3	Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns.
898173_13_ITEM7_P115_S4	Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations.
898173_13_ITEM7_P115_S5	Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations.
898173_13_ITEM7_P115_S6	The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
898173_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	W e offer warranties on certain merchandise we sel l with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties.
898173_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our vendors.
898173_13_ITEM7_P116_S2	Certain vendors provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims.
898173_13_ITEM7_P116_S3	For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims.
898173_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	Differences between vendor allowances received i n lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales.
898173_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line.
898173_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims.
898173_13_ITEM7_P118_S2	If warranty reserves were changed 10 % from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $3 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012.
898173_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits.
898173_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim.
898173_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations.
898173_13_ITEM7_P120_S2	Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities.
898173_13_ITEM7_P120_S3	Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains.
898173_13_ITEM7_P120_S4	As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information.
898173_13_ITEM7_P120_S5	These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value , using a credit-adjusted discount rate .
898173_13_ITEM7_P120_S6	These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_13_ITEM7_P120_S7	We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities.
898173_13_ITEM7_P120_S8	If self- insurance reserves were changed 10 % from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 11 million or 1.2 % of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012.
898173_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	Closed Property Reserves We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations.
898173_13_ITEM7_P121_S1	We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income.
898173_13_ITEM7_P121_S2	The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms.
898173_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions.
898173_13_ITEM7_P122_S1	Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates.
898173_13_ITEM7_P122_S2	Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known.
898173_13_ITEM7_P122_S3	If closed property reserves were changed 10 % from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1 % of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
898173_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	Legal Reserves We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O Reilly is currently involved.
898173_13_ITEM7_P123_S1	We are curre ntly involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business .
898173_13_ITEM7_P123_S2	We resolv ed the governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against CSK and certain of CSK s former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date.
898173_13_ITEM7_P123_S3	As a result of the acquisition, we incur red legal fees and costs related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations.
898173_13_ITEM7_P123_S4	Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK.
898173_13_ITEM7_P123_S5	Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures.
898173_13_ITEM7_P123_S6	If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012.
898173_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
898173_13_ITEM7_P124_S1	These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve.
898173_13_ITEM7_P124_S2	We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit.
898173_13_ITEM7_P124_S3	The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings.
898173_13_ITEM7_P124_S4	Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations.
898173_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented.
898173_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates.
898173_13_ITEM7_P125_S2	Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position.
898173_13_ITEM7_P125_S3	While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority.
898173_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_13_ITEM7_P126_S1	To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_13_ITEM7_P126_S2	As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
898173_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_13_ITEM7_P127_S1	While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 201 2 and 201 1 .
898173_13_ITEM7_P128_S1	The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown.
898173_13_ITEM7_P128_S2	The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.
898173_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	In February of 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2013-02, "Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" ( ASU 2013-02 ).
898173_13_ITEM7_P129_S1	Under ASU 2013-02, an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) by component.
898173_13_ITEM7_P129_S2	In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period.
898173_13_ITEM7_P129_S3	For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts.
898173_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	ASU 2013-02 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements.
898173_13_ITEM7_P130_S1	We plan to adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ended March 31, 2013; the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore, is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) with variable interest rates based on either a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Historically, we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates, however, as of December 31, 2012, we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $1.10 billion and $0.80 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
898173_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $1.20 billion and $0.85 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.
898173_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less.
898173_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal.
898173_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	As of December 31 , 201 2 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $ 248 million .
898173_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	The management of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company ), under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Company s Board of Directors , is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control ove r financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) or 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended .
898173_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
898173_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	Internal control over financial reporting includes all policies and procedures that:
898173_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	Management recognizes that all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
898173_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only rea sonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
898173_13_ITEM8_P3_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk.
898173_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
898173_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 201 2 .
898173_13_ITEM8_P5_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control Integrated Fr amework .
898173_13_ITEM8_P5_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 201 2 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
898173_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	Ernst Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has audited the Company s consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein.
898173_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	We have audited O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 20 1 2 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
898173_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
898173_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
898173_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
898173_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
898173_13_ITEM8_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
898173_13_ITEM8_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
898173_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
898173_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
898173_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
898173_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	In our opinion, O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 20 1 2 , based on the COSO criteria .
898173_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 20 1 2 and 20 1 1 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 20 1 2 , of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated February 2 8 , 201 3 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon .
898173_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries:
898173_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 201 2 and 201 1 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in th e period ended December 31, 201 2 .
898173_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) .
898173_13_ITEM8_P14_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
898173_13_ITEM8_P14_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
898173_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
898173_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
898173_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
898173_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
898173_13_ITEM8_P16_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
898173_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and S ubsidiaries at December 31, 201 2 and 201 1 , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in th e period ended December 31, 201 2 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
898173_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
898173_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial r eporting as of December 31, 201 2 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28 , 201 3 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon .

898173_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	The business was founded in 1957 by Charles F. O'Reilly and his son, Charles H. ''Chub'' O'Reilly, Sr. and initially operated from a single store in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our common stock has traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ORLY since April 22, 1993.
898173_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	At December 31, 2013, we operated 4,166 stores in 42 states.
898173_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our stores carry an extensive product line, including the products identified below:
898173_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	accessories, such as floor mats, seat covers and truck accessories.
898173_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers, such as those identified below:
898173_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 15 for a description of certain risks relevant to our business.
898173_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	These risk factors include, among others, deteriorating economic conditions, competition in the automotive aftermarket business, our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, future growth assurance, our dependence upon key and other personnel, our relationships with key vendors and availability of key products, our acquisition strategies, complications in our distribution centers ( DC s), failure to achieve high levels of services and products, the effect of sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, increased debt levels, a downgrade in our credit ratings, data security, and environmental legislation and other regulations.
898173_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy.
898173_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O Reilly values, including customer service and expense control.
898173_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	Our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve, by providing superior customer service and significant value to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution systems and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages which cannot be easily duplicated.
898173_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Proven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy:
898173_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Over the past 30 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage.
898173_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts, capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors, and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	In 2013, we derived approximately 58% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 42% of our sales from our professional service provider customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	We believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation, the opportunities for growth in our less mature markets, and our systems, knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, supported by 600 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer.
898173_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business over our competitors who do not have the same historical track record of serving the professional service provider.
898173_14_ITEM1_P11_S3	We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on the growth of our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy.
898173_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Superior Customer Service: We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products.
898173_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe that the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the specific automotive products requested.
898173_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	Accordingly, each O'Reilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications.
898173_14_ITEM1_P12_S3	We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management's assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.
898173_14_ITEM1_P12_S4	We have no material backorders for the products we sell.
898173_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	We seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below:
898173_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Technically Proficient Professional Parts People: Our highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators.
898173_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard parts, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis.
898173_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People.
898173_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	We believe our commitment to a robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network.
898173_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes DCs and Hub stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management.
898173_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	We currently operate 24 regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 147,000 stock keeping units ( SKUs ), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P15_S4	To augment our robust DC network, we operate 266 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to an average of 43,000 SKUs to other stores within the surrounding area.
898173_14_ITEM1_P15_S5	We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.
898173_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Experienced Management Team: Our Company philosophy is to promote from within and the vast majority of our senior management, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company.
898173_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience.
898173_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	We have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 166 professionals who average 18 years of service; 210 corporate managers who average 16 years of service; and 404 district managers who average 12 years of service.
898173_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 21 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993.
898173_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Aggressively Open New Stores: We intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket.
898173_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	During 2013, we opened 190 net, new stores and we plan to open approximately 200 net, new stores in 2014, which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets.
898173_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O'Reilly stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	We typically open new stores by (i) constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory, (ii) acquiring an independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store, or (iii) purchasing multi-store chains.
898173_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	New store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities, competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius, and the operational strength of such competitors.
898173_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network.
898173_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets.
898173_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_14_ITEM1_P19_S3	Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.
898173_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Grow Sales in Existing Stores: Profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy.
898173_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O'Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability.
898173_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions: The automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, such as ourselves, to operate more efficiently and proficiently than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation.
898173_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets.
898173_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Continually Enhance Store Design and Location: Our current prototype store design features enhancements such as optimized square footage, higher ceilings, more convenient interior store layouts, improved in-store signage, brighter lighting, increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance overall customer service.
898173_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance.
898173_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	During 2013, we relocated 19 stores and renovated 57 stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best serve our customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Continually Enhance the Growth and Functionality of Our E-Commerce Website: Our user-friendly website, www.oreillyauto.com , allows our customers to search product and repair content, check the in-store availability of our products, and place orders for either home delivery or in-store pickup.
898173_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	We continue to enhance the functionality of our website to provide our customers with a friendly and convenient shopping experience, as well as a robust product and repair content information resource, which will continue to build the O Reilly Brand.
898173_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	As of January 31, 2014, we employed 62,533 Team Members ( 31,771 full-time Team Members and 30,762 part-time Team Members), of whom 53,317 were employed at our stores, 6,613 were employed at our DCs and 2,603 were employed at our corporate and regional offices.
898173_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	A union represents 50 stores ( 535 Team Members) in the Greater Bay Area in California, and has for many years.
898173_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	In addition, approximately 66 Team Members who drive over-the-road trucks in two of our DCs are represented by a labor union.
898173_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Except for these Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions.
898173_14_ITEM1_P26_S3	Our tradition for 57 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our Live Green Culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member s contribution to the success of O Reilly.
898173_14_ITEM1_P26_S4	This focus on professionalism and fairness has created an industry-leading team and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent.
898173_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Store Locations and Size: As a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our stores, on average, carry approximately 24,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,000 total square feet in size.
898173_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	At December 31, 2013, we had a total of approximately 30 million square feet in our 4,166 stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 147,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 266 Hub stores, which, on average, carry approximately 43,000 SKUs and average approximately 10,000 square feet in size.
898173_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	We believe that our stores are ''destination stores'' generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity.
898173_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares, and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	The following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of December 31, 2013 and 2012:
898173_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Store Layout: We utilize a computer-assisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent retail merchandise presentation and customize our hard-parts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area.
898173_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	Front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access, maximum selling space and to prominently display high-turnover products and accessories to customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	To ensure the best customer experience possible, we have selectively implemented bilingual in-store signage based on the demographics in each store s geographic area.
898173_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Aisle displays and end caps are used to feature high-demand, seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.
898173_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Store Automation: To enhance store-level operations, customer service and reliability, we use Linux servers and IBM I-Series computer systems in our stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	These systems are linked with the I-Series computers located in each of our DCs.
898173_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our point-of-sale system provides immediate access to our electronic catalog, part images, schematics and pricing information by make, model and year of vehicle and uses barcode scanning technology to price our merchandise.
898173_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	This system speeds transaction times, reduces the customer s checkout time, ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service.
898173_14_ITEM1_P32_S4	Moreover, our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management, strategic planning, inventory control and distribution efficiency.
898173_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are identified below:
898173_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	the type and size of store that should be developed.
898173_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale.
898173_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas.
898173_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	As these store clusters mature, we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas.
898173_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.
898173_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store.
898173_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	Each of our 404 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten stores, which provides our stores with a strong amount of operational support.
898173_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	Store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model.
898173_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	Store and district managers also receive continuous training through online assignments, field workshops, regional meetings and our annual managers' conference.
898173_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through incentive compensation programs.
898173_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	Under our incentive compensation programs, base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and/or store sales and profitability.
898173_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	In addition, each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs, and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store s performance.
898173_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store Team Members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.
898173_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	We believe our highly trained team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	Because a significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products.
898173_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from a Professional Parts Person, particularly when purchasing hard parts.
898173_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.
898173_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	We screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs, or automotive aptitude.
898173_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company as well as the requirements for their specific job position.
898173_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P41_S3	Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O Reilly Certified Parts Professional test.
898173_14_ITEM1_P41_S4	Passing the O Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE).
898173_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	All of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager.
898173_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	Afterward, these Team Members spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	Additionally, each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.
898173_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	We believe that our tiered distribution model provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions, while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory.
898173_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	Moreover, we believe the ongoing, significant capital investments made in our DC network allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network.
898173_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	Our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each DC.
898173_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	As of December 31, 2013, we had a total growth capacity of over 225 stores in our distribution center network, which increased by 300 stores with the completion of our Lakeland, Florida DC in January of 2014, and will increase by 250 stores with the completion of our Chicago, Illinois, DC in the second half of 2014 and 210 net stores with the relocation of our existing Lewiston, Maine, DC to a facility in Devens, Massachusetts, in the second half of 2014.
898173_14_ITEM1_P43_S4	Including this planned growth, we expect to end the year in 2014 with a total growth capacity in our distribution system of over 750 stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Distribution Centers: As of December 31, 2013, we operated 24 DCs comprised of approximately 8.6 million operating square feet (see the "Properties" table in Item 2 of this Form 10-K for a detailed listing of DC operating square footages).
898173_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our DCs electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	Our DCs stock an average of 147,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional DCs on-hand inventory.
898173_14_ITEM1_P44_S3	Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to all of our stores in the continental United States.
898173_14_ITEM1_P44_S4	In addition, stores within an individual DC's metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC's city counter , most of which receive this service seven days per week.
898173_14_ITEM1_P44_S5	Our DCs also provide weekend service not only to stores they service via their city counters, but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute to surrounding stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P44_S6	Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	With our planned DC expansion during 2014, we expect to end the year in 2014 operating 26 DCs comprised of approximately 9.9 million operating square feet.
898173_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	As part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2014, we plan to:
898173_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	expand our distribution network by adding two additional new DCs to our network and relocating one DC to a larger, state-of-the art facility.
898173_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Hub stores: We currently operate 266 strategically located Hub stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis.
898173_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our Hub stores average approximately 10,000 square feet and carry an average of 43,000 SKUs.
898173_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of brand name, house brands and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks.
898173_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, BWD, Cardone, Castrol, Gates Rubber, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Quaker State, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix.
898173_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	In addition to name brand products, our stores carry a wide variety of high-quality house brands and private label products under our BestTest , BrakeBest , Import Direct , Master Pro , Micro-Gard , Murray , Omnispark , O Reilly Auto Parts , Precision , Power Torque , Super Start , and Ultima brands.
898173_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	Our house brand and private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value a characteristic important to our DIY customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	We have no long-term contractual purchase commitments with any of our vendors, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts.
898173_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs, for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell.
898173_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our vendors and to utilize extended dating terms available from vendors.
898173_14_ITEM1_P50_S3	Again in 2013, we entered into various programs and arrangements with certain vendors that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases.
898173_14_ITEM1_P50_S4	As a whole, we consider our relationships with our vendors to be very good.
898173_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500 vendors, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 24% of our total purchases in 2013.
898173_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our largest vendor in 2013 accounted for approximately 7% of our total purchases and the next four largest vendors each accounted for approximately 3% to 6% of our total purchases.
898173_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Marketing to the DIY Customer: We use an integrated marketing program, which includes television, radio, direct mail and newspaper distribution, in-store, online, and social media promotions, and sports and event sponsorships to aggressively attract DIY customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	The marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the O Reilly Brand across our geographic footprint.
898173_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	We utilize a combination of brand and product/price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases, which frequently coincide with key sales events.
898173_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	To stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts, who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public, we sponsored multiple nationally-televised races and over 1,500 grassroots, local, and regional motorsports events throughout 42 states during 2013.
898173_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	National series events in Texas and four National Hot Rod Association ( NHRA ) races across the country.
898173_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	During the fall and winter months, we strategically sponsor National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) basketball.
898173_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	Our relationships with over 30 NCAA teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently-displayed O Reilly logos on TV-visible signs throughout the season.
898173_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Through an expanded use of Spanish language radio, print, and outdoor advertising, as well as sponsorships of over 45 local and regional festivals and events, we demonstrated our commitment to increasing marketing efforts that are targeted toward the Spanish speaking auto parts consumer.
898173_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	In 2013, we continued our dedicated problem/solution communication strategy, which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance as a way to save money and protect their automotive investment over the long term.
898173_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	This highly relevant message resonates with consumers and establishes O Reilly as their source for the parts they need and excellent customer service.
898173_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	Reilly O Rewards DIY customer loyalty program.
898173_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	The program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points toward coupons, which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	The programs allow us to enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business and target promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns, while also rewarding our customers for their continued business.
898173_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Marketing to the Professional Service Provider Customer: We have over 600 full-time O Reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our First Call program.
898173_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon, selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	Targeted marketing materials such as flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers, paint and body shops and fleet customers.
898173_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	district managers, and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services identified below:
898173_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	Marketing to the Independently Owned Parts Store: Along with the daily operation and management of the DCs and the distribution of automotive products to our stores, Ozark Automotive Distributors, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary ( Ozark ), also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores ( jobber stores ) throughout our trade areas.
898173_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	These jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an O'Reilly store.
898173_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	Approximately 181 jobber stores currently purchase automotive products from Ozark and participate in our Parts City Auto Parts program, our proprietary jobber service program.
898173_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	As a participant in these programs, a jobber store, which meets certain financial and operational standards, is permitted to indicate its Parts City Auto Parts membership through the display of trademarked logo that is owned by Ozark.
898173_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	In return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from Ozark, we provide computer software for business management, competitive pricing, advertising, marketing and sales assistance to Parts City Auto Parts affiliate stores.
898173_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	We believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business.
898173_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	Product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store.
898173_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	Most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of competitor price comparisons and internal gross margin targets and are generally sold at a discount to the manufacturer s suggested retail price with additional savings offered through volume discounts and special promotional pricing.
898173_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	Consistent with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any in-stock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area.
898173_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	Our stores accept cash, checks, debit and credit cards.
898173_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	We also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our pre-established credit requirements.
898173_14_ITEM1_P66_S2	Some of the factors considered in our pre-established credit requirements include customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_14_ITEM1_P66_S3	No customer accounted for ten percent or more of our consolidated net sales, nor do we have any dependence on any single customer.
898173_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	We accept product returns for new products, core products and warranty/defective products.
898173_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	The automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light- and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale.
898173_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	The total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $239 billion , according to the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ).
898173_14_ITEM1_P68_S2	This market is made up of four segments labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales and tire sales.
898173_14_ITEM1_P68_S3	Reilly s addressable market within this industry is approximately $136 billion , which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and DIY sales.
898173_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations.
898173_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	The sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition and price.
898173_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market.
898173_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	We compete primarily with the stores identified below:
898173_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout and convenient and accessible store locations.
898173_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	Our dual market strategy requires significant capital to support, such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.
898173_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	We have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	To the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_14_ITEM1_P72_S2	As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
898173_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	To some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	Store sales, profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	We are subject to federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, including those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.
898173_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our oil and battery recycling programs.
898173_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party vendors.
898173_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our Team Members, deposited into vendor-supplied containers and pallets, and then disposed of by the third-party vendors.
898173_14_ITEM1_P76_S3	In general, our agreements with such vendors contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the vendor.
898173_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date.
898173_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	However, we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.

898173_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In recent years, worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions, including the United States, and such conditions may worsen in the foreseeable future.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Many of these factors are outside of our control.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our customers purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the U.S., the total number of registered vehicles in the U.S., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the U.S.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Also, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Both the DIY and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	For a list of our principal competitors, see the Competition section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to DIY customers.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In addition, our stores and DCs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We cannot assure future growth will be achieved.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2014 and beyond will be achieved.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	For a discussion of our growth strategies, see the Growth Strategy section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient, and as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P7_S7	For a discussion of our management, see the Business section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors' ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	For example, financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In addition, the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors, and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following:
898173_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, the subsequent owner or operator, may be liable.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, operability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters or the threat of them, may result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers ( DCs ) or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	This may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or other catastrophic events.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We believe our Company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or Team Members.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	All of the shares of our common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We believe sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of acquired businesses will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	If we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our stock price would likely suffer.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We have in place an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	For example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things:
898173_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	expose us to fluctuations in interest rates.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In addition, the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative and negative covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	A downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive vendor financing programs.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These ratings are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	A downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	A downgrade could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our notes, preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P24_S5	In addition, a downgrade could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our vendor financing programs at attractive rates.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Decreased participation in our vendor financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business, adversely affecting our cash flow.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	A breach of customer, Team Member or Company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and Team Members.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Litigation, governmental proceedings, environmental legislation and regulations and employment laws and regulations may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings, arising out of the ordinary course of our business.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Environmental legislation and regulations, like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change, could adversely impact all industries.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	While it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, by, among other things, increasing fuel prices.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business is subject to employment laws and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as minimum wage legislation.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	A violation of or change in employment laws and/or regulations could hinder our ability to control costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by Congress and state legislatures, significantly impacts our healthcare cost structure and increases our healthcare-related expenses.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We are currently evaluating the potential additional impact the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate such impact, including potential further modifications to our current benefit plans, operational changes to minimize the effect of the legislation on our cost structure and increases to selling prices to mitigate the expected increase in healthcare-related expenses.
898173_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If we cannot effectively modify our programs and operations in response to the new legislation, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.
898173_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Distribution centers, stores, and other properties As of December 31, 2013, we operated 24 regional distribution centers ( DC s), of which nine were leased ( 2.9 million operating square footage) and 15 were owned ( 5.7 million operating square footage) for total DC operating square footage of 8.6 million square feet.
898173_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	The following table provides information regarding our DCs, returns facilities and corporate offices as of December 31, 2013:
898173_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) Includes floor and mezzanine operating square footage, excludes subleased square footage.
898173_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	(2) Occupied under the terms of a lease with an affiliated party.
898173_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	The leased facilities typically require a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expense and have an original term of, at a minimum, 20 years, subject to one five-year renewal at our option.
898173_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	by an affiliated director s immediate family.
898173_14_ITEM2_P3_S1	This lease requires payment of a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of 15 years, subject to three five-year renewals at our option.
898173_14_ITEM2_P3_S2	We believe that this lease agreement with the affiliated entity is on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.
898173_14_ITEM2_P4_S0	Of the 4,166 stores that we operated at December 31, 2013, 1,469 stores were owned, 2,620 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 77 stores were leased from entities in which certain of our affiliated directors, members of our affiliated director s immediate family, or our executive officers, are affiliated.
898173_14_ITEM2_P4_S1	Leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of, at a minimum, 10 years, subject to one or more renewals at our option.
898173_14_ITEM2_P4_S2	We have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby.
898173_14_ITEM2_P4_S3	Such master lease agreements with three of the eight affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores.
898173_14_ITEM2_P4_S4	The master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from April 30, 2014 , to September 30, 2031 .
898173_14_ITEM2_P4_S5	We believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.
898173_14_ITEM2_P5_S0	We believe that our present facilities are in good condition, are adequately insured and are adequate for the conduct of our current operations.
898173_14_ITEM2_P6_S0	The store servicing capability of our 24 existing DCs is approximately 4,400 stores, providing a growth capacity of more than 225 stores, which increased by 300 stores with the completion of our Lakeland, Florida, DC in January of 2014 and will increase by 250 stores with the completion of our Chicago, Illinois, DC and 210 stores with the completion of our Devens, Massachusetts, DC, both of which are expected to open in the second half of 2014.
898173_14_ITEM2_P6_S1	We believe the growth capacity in our 24 existing DCs, along with the additional capacity of our new Lakeland, Chicago and Devens DCs, will provide us with the DC infrastructure needed for near-term expansion.
898173_14_ITEM2_P6_S2	However, as we expand our geographic footprint, we will continue to evaluate our existing distribution system infrastructure and will adjust our distribution system capacity as needed to support our future growth.
898173_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	O Reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company s business.
898173_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Company records reserves for litigation losses in instances where a material adverse outcome is probable and the Company is able to reasonably estimate the probable loss.
898173_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	The Company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred in pending litigation matters.
898173_14_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, it does not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters, taking into account applicable insurance and reserves, will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.
898173_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	In addition, O Reilly was involved in resolving governmental investigations that were being conducted against CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK") and CSK s former officers and other litigation, prior to its acquisition by O Reilly in 2008, as described below.
898173_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	As previously reported, the governmental investigations of CSK regarding its legacy pre-acquisition accounting practices have concluded.
898173_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	All criminal charges against former employees of CSK related to its legacy pre-acquisition accounting practices, as well as the civil litigation filed against CSK s former Chief Executive Officer by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), have concluded.
898173_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	Under Delaware law, the charter documents of the CSK entities and certain indemnification agreements, CSK may have certain indemnification obligations.
898173_14_ITEM3_P3_S1	As a result of the CSK acquisition, O Reilly has incurred legal fees and costs related to these potential indemnification obligations arising from the litigation commenced by the Department of Justice and SEC against CSK s former employees.
898173_14_ITEM3_P3_S2	Whether those legal fees and costs are covered by CSK s insurance is subject to uncertainty, and, given its complexity and scope, the final outcome cannot be predicted at this time.
898173_14_ITEM3_P3_S3	Reilly has a remaining reserve, with respect to the indemnification obligations of $13.4 million at December 31, 2013, which relates to the payment of those legal fees and costs already incurred.
898173_14_ITEM3_P4_S0	It is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the Company s results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by resolution of such matter, depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flows for such period.
898173_14_ITEM3_P4_S1	However, at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter, after consideration of applicable reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

898173_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The table below compares O Reilly Automotive, Inc. s (the Company s ) selected financial data over a ten-year period.
898173_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) The cumulative change in accounting method, effective January 1, 2004, changed the method of applying last-in, first-out accounting policy for certain inventory costs.
898173_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	Under the new method, included in the value of inventory are certain procurement, warehousing and distribution center costs.
898173_14_ITEM6_P1_S2	The previous method was to recognize those costs as incurred, reported as a component of costs of goods sold.
898173_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	In 2005, 2008 and 2012, the Company acquired Midwest Auto Parts Distributors ( Midwest ), CSK Auto Corporation ( CSK ) and VIP Parts, Tires Service ( VIP ), respectively.
898173_14_ITEM6_P2_S1	The 2005 Midwest acquisition added 72 stores, the 2008 CSK acquisition added 1,342 stores and the 2012 VIP acquisition added 56 stores to the O Reilly store count.
898173_14_ITEM6_P2_S2	Financial results for these acquired companies have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the dates of the acquisitions forward.

898173_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States.
898173_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ( DIY ) customers and professional service providers our dual market strategy .
898173_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment.
898173_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer.
898173_14_ITEM7_P5_S4	For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good , better , and best alternatives.
898173_14_ITEM7_P5_S5	Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products.
898173_14_ITEM7_P5_S6	Consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry.
898173_14_ITEM7_P5_S7	Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers: used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops.
898173_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we operated 4,166 stores in 42 states.
898173_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits, and competition.
898173_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact O Reilly and the retail sector in general.
898173_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	We believe that the average consumer s tendency has been to trade down to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions.
898173_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of purchasing up on the value spectrum.
898173_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	We believe these ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products will result in our customers willingness to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers; however, we cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change.
898173_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.
898173_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.
898173_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	According to the Department of Transportation, prior to 2007, the annual number of total miles driven in the U.S. had steadily increased; however, since that time, as the U.S. experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions and historically high levels of unemployment, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. have remained relatively flat.
898173_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Although total miles driven have not significantly increased since 2007, vehicles in the U.S. continue to be driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and continued demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.
898173_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	In addition, we believe that as the U.S. economy continues to recover and the level of unemployment declines, total miles driven in the U.S. will return to a period of annual growth, supporting continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ), the total number of registered vehicles has increased 8% over the past decade, from 229 million light vehicles in 2002 to 247 million light vehicles in 2012.
898173_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Annual new light vehicle registrations declined 14% over the past decade, from 16.7 million registrations in 2002 to 14.3 million registrations in 2012; however, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (the SAAR ) of sales of light vehicles in the U.S. increased to 15 million as of December 31, 2013, indicating that the trend of declining new light vehicle registrations has reversed.
898173_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	In addition, during the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates remained relatively stable, ranging from just 4.6% to 5.7% annually.
898173_14_ITEM7_P11_S4	The stable scrappage rates over the past decade have contributed to an increase in the average age of the U.S. vehicle population over that period, growing 16% , from 9.6 years in 2002 to 11.1 years in 2012.
898173_14_ITEM7_P11_S5	We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles.
898173_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty.
898173_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles.
898173_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	As the U.S. economy recovers, we believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Unemployment - Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the continued uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending.
898173_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Long-term trends of high unemployment could continue to impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	However, as of December 31, 2013, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 6.7% , its lowest rate in over five years.
898173_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	We believe that as the economy continues to recover, unemployment rates should decline and we would expect to see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work.
898173_14_ITEM7_P13_S4	Aided by the anticipated increase in commuter miles, we believe overall annual U.S. miles driven should return to a period of annual growth, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.
898173_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:
898173_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Under the Company s share repurchase program, as approved by the Board of Directors in January of 2011, the Company may, from time to time, repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Company and its Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	The Company s Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, which was announced on May 29, 2013, and an additional $500 million, which was announced on February 5, 2014, raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to $ 4.0 billion .
898173_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	As of February 28, 2014, we had repurchased approximately 40.6 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $ 3.4 billion under this program.
898173_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	On July 2, 2013, the Company amended its credit agreement, which it entered into in January of 2011.
898173_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The amendment lowered the maximum borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility to $ 600 million , extended the maturity date of the credit agreement to July of 2018 and lowered the interest rate margins on borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility and facility fees applicable to the commitments thereunder.
898173_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:
898173_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased $ 467 million to $ 6.65 billion from $ 6.18 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8% .
898173_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.3% and 3.8% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
898173_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from the VIP Parts, Tires Service ("VIP") stores acquired on December 31, 2012, due to the significant change in the business model and lack of historical data.
898173_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in millions):
898173_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2013, Compared to the Same Period in 2012 Store sales:
898173_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, enhanced services and programs offered in most stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2013, was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both DIY and commercial business, and an increase in customer transaction counts for commercial business, slightly offset by a small decrease in customer transaction counts for DIY business.
898173_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	The improvements in average ticket values were the result of the continued growth of the more costly hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales.
898173_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	The growth in the hard part categories was driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in DIY hard part sales, as consumers continue to maintain and repair their existing vehicles.
898173_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	The increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts were driven by the chainwide growth of our professional business, while macroeconomic pressures on disposable income continue to negatively impact DIY customer transaction counts.
898173_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, which have been manufactured in recent years.
898173_14_ITEM7_P24_S5	These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the repair is, on average, greater.
898173_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	We opened 190 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 180 net, new stores and 56 acquired stores for the year ended December 31, 2012.
898173_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	At December 31, 2013, we operated 4,166 stores in 42 states compared to 3,976 stores in 42 states at December 31, 2012.
898173_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 200 net, new stores in 2014.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 3.37 billion (or 50.7% of sales) from $ 3.10 billion (or 50.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9% .
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to acquisition cost improvements, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution system efficiencies, partially offset by a smaller amount of capitalized distribution costs in the current year, the non-cash impact to gross margin resulting from the depletion of our last-in, first-out ("LIFO") reserve and the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of our total sales mix.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S4	The improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S5	Distribution system efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S6	The decrease in capitalized distribution costs in the current year is the result of the larger than typical benefit from capitalized distribution costs in the prior year associated with our initiative to increase our store-level inventories.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S7	The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores in the prior year were more efficient than routine restocking activity; as a result, we realized a larger than normal benefit from capitalized distribution costs.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S8	The depletion of our LIFO reserve during the year resulted from the acquisition cost improvements we have realized over time.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S9	The Company's policy is not to write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and, accordingly, we are now effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S10	During 2013, our LIFO cost was written down by approximately $21.6 million to reflect replacement cost.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S11	We expect to incur pressure from product acquisition cost reductions in the first quarter of 2014; however, at this time, we do not anticipate material charges for the last three quarters of 2014.
898173_14_ITEM7_P26_S12	Unforeseen significant acquisition cost decreases could occur and may create additional LIFO gross margin headwinds during 2014.
898173_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers, therefore, outsized growth, as compared to DIY, creates pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales.
898173_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 2.27 billion (or 34.1% of sales) from $ 2.12 billion (or 34.3% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7% .
898173_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count.
898173_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of improved leverage of store payroll and occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.
898173_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 1.10 billion (or 16.6% of sales) from $ 977 million (or 15.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13% .
898173_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 45 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $ 36 million (or 0.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 24% .
898173_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily due to increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings.
898173_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 389 million ( 36.7% effective tax rate) from $ 356 million ( 37.8% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9% .
898173_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income.
898173_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	The decrease in our tax rate was primarily due to the benefits of employment tax credits realized in the current year, adjustments to tax reserves related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits during the current year and unfavorable adjustments relating to certain income tax audits in the prior year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 670 million (or 10.1% of sales), from $ 586 million (or 9.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 14% .
898173_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased 27% to $ 6.03 on 111 million shares from $ 4.75 on 123 million shares for the same period one year ago.
898173_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased $393 million to $6.18 billion from $5.79 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%.
898173_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 3.8% and 4.6% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
898173_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members.
898173_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 (in millions):
898173_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2012, Compared to the Same Period in 2011 Store sales:
898173_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2012, was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decrease in DIY customer transaction counts.
898173_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	The improvement in average ticket values was a result of the continued growth of the more costly, hard part categories, as a percentage of our total sales.
898173_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	The growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider customer sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in DIY hard part sales, as consumers continue to maintain and repair their vehicles.
898173_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	The strong increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts, driven by our acquired markets, have been offset by pressured DIY transaction counts.
898173_14_ITEM7_P38_S4	DIY customer transaction counts continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic pressures on disposable income, including sustained unemployment levels above historical averages.
898173_14_ITEM7_P38_S5	Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, which have been manufactured in recent years.
898173_14_ITEM7_P38_S6	These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the repair is typically greater.
898173_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	We opened 180 net, new stores and acquired 56 stores during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 170 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	At December 31, 2012, we operated 3,976 stores in 42 states compared to 3,740 stores in 39 states at December 31, 2011.
898173_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $3.10 billion (or 50.1% of sales) from $2.84 billion (or 49.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9%.
898173_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increases in sales from new stores and the increases in comparable store sales at existing stores.
898173_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to DC efficiencies, acquisition cost improvements and improved inventory shrinkage, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of the total sales mix.
898173_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	DC efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs.
898173_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	In addition, during 2012 we increased our store-level inventories as a component of our focus on providing higher service levels.
898173_14_ITEM7_P40_S5	The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores were more efficient than routine restocking activity and, as a result, we realized a one-time benefit from capitalized distribution costs.
898173_14_ITEM7_P40_S6	This capitalization of costs benefited gross margin by approximately 20 basis points versus the prior year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs.
898173_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks.
898173_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers, therefore, creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales.
898173_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $2.12 billion (or 34.3% of sales) from $1.97 billion (or 34.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%.
898173_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count.
898173_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	The slight increase in SG A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of our focus on store staffing levels to continue to deliver industry-leading customer service while adjusting to the slower sales environment, as well as an overall deleverage on soft comparable store sales.
898173_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) from $867 million (or 15.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13%.
898173_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, decreased to $36 million (or 0.6% of sales), from $51 million (or 0.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing a decrease of 30%.
898173_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	The decrease in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, was primarily due to one-time charges related to our financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), partially offset by increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as compared to the prior year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $356 million (37.8% effective tax rate) from $308 million (37.8% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15%.
898173_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income.
898173_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $586 million (or 9.5% of sales), from $508 million (or 8.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15%.
898173_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 28% to $4.75 on 123 million shares from $3.71 on 137 million shares for the same period one year ago.
898173_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK for SEC purposes, of $3 million ($2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer.
898173_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	This clawback amount was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011.
898173_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million ($13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $4 million ($3 million, net of tax).
898173_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in Other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_14_ITEM7_P49_S5	The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table.
898173_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 13% to $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) from $864 million (or 14.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago.
898173_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 12% to $586 million (or 9.5% of sales) from $522 million (or 9.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago.
898173_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 25% to $4.75 from $3.81 for the same period one year ago.
898173_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	The financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
898173_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, and the former CSK officer clawback, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations.
898173_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	is useful to investors as well.
898173_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program.
898173_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
898173_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations.
898173_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
898173_14_ITEM7_P54_S4	We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
898173_14_ITEM7_P54_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels.
898173_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in millions):
898173_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.
898173_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	(2) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.
898173_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Current liabilities increased 7% , total debt increased 27% and total equity decreased 7% from 2012 to 2013.
898173_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing program and the additional vendor participation during the year, which allowed us to obtain more favorable payment terms.
898173_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 86.6% as of December 31, 2013, as compared to 84.7% one year prior.
898173_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of $300 million of 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023.
898173_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):
898173_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	(a) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period.
898173_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Operating activities: The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a smaller increase in income taxes payable, offset in part by an increase in net income for the year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors.
898173_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs.
898173_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	Our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors.
898173_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 86.6% , 84.7% and 64.4% at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
898173_14_ITEM7_P62_S4	The smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2013 is the result of a smaller increase in the number of new vendors added to our financing programs in the current year versus the prior year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P62_S5	We launched our enhanced vendor financing program in January of 2011, and were able to add a large number of vendors to the programs during 2011 and 2012.
898173_14_ITEM7_P62_S6	As we anniversary these vendor additions to the programs, we expect to see a slower rate of growth in our accounts payable to inventory ratio.
898173_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	The smaller increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of a prepaid tax position at the beginning of 2012 versus a payable position at the beginning of 2013.
898173_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges and the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011), decreases in net inventory and other assets and increases in income taxes payable (adjusted for the effect of non-cash change in deferred income taxes and the excess tax benefit from stock options exercised) and other current liabilities.
898173_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 84.7%, 64.4% and 44.3% at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
898173_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	The decrease in other assets was primarily the result of the timing of payments from vendors for receivables due to the Company under various programs.
898173_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	The increase in income taxes payable, adjusted for the non-cash impacts discussed above, was primarily the result of the prepayment of income taxes during 2011.
898173_14_ITEM7_P64_S4	The increase in other current liabilities was primarily the result of the payment, during 2011, for the one-time monetary penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation.
898173_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Investing activities: The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during the current year related to the purchase and construction of new distribution facilities during 2013 to support our ongoing store growth.
898173_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	The total capital expenditures were $396 million and $301 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
898173_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures during 2012, partially offset by small acquisitions during the year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Total capital expenditures were $301 million and $328 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
898173_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	The decrease in capital expenditures during 2012, as compared to 2011, was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased stores opened.
898173_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	We were able to find real estate with attractive lease rates during 2012 and as a result, opened a larger number of leased locations during 2012 as compared to the year prior.
898173_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Opening a new store in a leased location requires a smaller capital investment than opening an owned location.
898173_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	We opened 190 , 180, and 170 net, new stores in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, and acquired 56 stores in 2012.
898173_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	We plan to open 200 net, new stores in 2014.
898173_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $ 1.3 million to $ 1.5 million ; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.
898173_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Financing activities: The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily attributable to the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during the current year, in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program.
898173_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2012, in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program and greater net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during 2011, partially offset by an increase in the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under the Company s incentive programs and the related tax benefits during 2012.
898173_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Credit facilities: On January 14, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") for a five-year $ 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") arranged by Bank of America, N.A. and Barclays Capital, originally scheduled to mature in January of 2016.
898173_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	During 2011, we completed our first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, decreasing the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to $ 660 million , extending the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to September of 2016 and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	In conjunction with the first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification in the amount of $ 0.3 million , which is included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_14_ITEM7_P71_S3	In July of 2013, we completed our second amendment to the Credit Agreement, decreasing the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to $ 600 million , extending the maturity date on the Credit Agreement to July of 2018 and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_14_ITEM7_P71_S4	The Credit Agreement includes a $ 200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $ 75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings.
898173_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $ 200 million .
898173_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	related to workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $ 52 million and $ 57 million as of December 13, 2013 and 2012, respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by those amounts.
898173_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	On July 11, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility (the "ABL Credit Facility"), which was scheduled to mature in July of 2013.
898173_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding borrowings of $356 million under the ABL Credit Facility, of which $106 million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract.
898173_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	All outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility were repaid, and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on January 14, 2011, and the ABL Credit Facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021, as further described below.
898173_14_ITEM7_P74_S3	In conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million and a one-time charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of $4 million, which are included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
898173_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Senior Notes: 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021: On January 14, 2011 , we issued $ 500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ) at a price to the public of 99.297% of their face value with UMB as trustee.
898173_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, which began on July 14, 2011, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	4.625% Senior Notes due 2021: On September 19, 2011 , we issued $ 300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ) at a price to the public of 99.826% of their face value with UMB as trustee.
898173_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	Interest on the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, which began on March 15, 2012, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	3.800% Senior Notes due 2022: On August 21, 2012 , we issued $ 300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 ( 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 ) at a price to the public of 99.627% of their face value with UMB as trustee.
898173_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	Interest on the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, which began on March 1, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	3.850% Senior Notes due 2023: On June 20, 2013 , we issued $ 300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 ( 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 ) at a price to the public of 99.992% of their face value with UMB as trustee.
898173_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	Interest on the 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which began on December 15, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	The net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases.
898173_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries ( Subsidiary Guarantors ) that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility or certain of our other debt or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors.
898173_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the subsidiary guarantor s guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all the property of, the subsidiary guarantor.
898173_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries.
898173_14_ITEM7_P79_S3	Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries.
898173_14_ITEM7_P79_S4	Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law.
898173_14_ITEM7_P79_S5	Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures.
898173_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.
898173_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.25 times through December 31, 2014, and 2.50 times thereafter through maturity, and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times through maturity.
898173_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock-based compensation expense ( EBITDAR ).
898173_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt.
898173_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of credit extensions, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders.
898173_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.98 times and 4.95 times as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.90 times and 1.83 times as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.
898173_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio range of 2.00 times to 2.25 times.
898173_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
898173_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
898173_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	We believe that the presentation of our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio and free cash flow provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement.
898173_14_ITEM7_P84_S3	We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_14_ITEM7_P84_S4	Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_14_ITEM7_P84_S5	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	Share repurchase program: Under our share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	We may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the cumulative authorization amount under the program was $ 3.5 billion .
898173_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	On February 5, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a resolution to increase the cumulative authorization amount by an additional $ 500 million , which is effective for a three-year period and expires February 5, 2017.
898173_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	As of February 5, 2014, the cumulative authorization amount under the program was $ 4.0 billion .
898173_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	The following table identifies shares of the Company s common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data):
898173_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had $ 146 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
898173_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 28, 2014, we did not repurchase a material number of shares of our common stock.
898173_14_ITEM7_P88_S2	We repurchased a total of 41 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 28, 2014, at an average price of $ 82.61 for a total aggregate investment of $ 3.4 billion .
898173_14_ITEM7_P88_S3	As of February 28, 2014, we had approximately $ 645 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
898173_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 Leasing and Note 13 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment s cancellation terms.
898173_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2014, which are included in Current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
898173_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	(1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $ 600 million and matures in July of 2018, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.975% to 1.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.
898173_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above.
898173_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.150% to 0.400% based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.
898173_14_ITEM7_P91_S3	Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans is 0.000% , our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 0.975% and our facility fee is 0.150% .
898173_14_ITEM7_P91_S4	As of December 31, 2013, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	(2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments.
898173_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits.
898173_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount.
898173_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 16 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined.
898173_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we recorded a liability of $ 59 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of Other liabilities .
898173_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
898173_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	We have historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.
898173_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $ 200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies.
898173_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance.
898173_14_ITEM7_P96_S3	Letters of credit totaling $ 52 million and $ 57 million were outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
898173_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
898173_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	See Contractual Obligations and Note 13 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our operating leases.
898173_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management.
898173_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
898173_14_ITEM7_P98_S2	Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates.
898173_14_ITEM7_P98_S3	Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP.
898173_14_ITEM7_P98_S4	However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.
898173_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal.
898173_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population.
898173_14_ITEM7_P99_S3	We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand.
898173_14_ITEM7_P99_S4	We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost.
898173_14_ITEM7_P99_S5	This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods.
898173_14_ITEM7_P99_S6	Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances.
898173_14_ITEM7_P99_S7	We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future.
898173_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink.
898173_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories.
898173_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates.
898173_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	If unrecorded shrink changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business.
898173_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors.
898173_14_ITEM7_P102_S2	Actual results have consistently been within management s expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts.
898173_14_ITEM7_P102_S3	However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains.
898173_14_ITEM7_P102_S4	If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment.
898173_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset.
898173_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	The estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations.
898173_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.
898173_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets.
898173_14_ITEM7_P106_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment.
898173_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	We have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill.
898173_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach.
898173_14_ITEM7_P108_S2	Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value.
898173_14_ITEM7_P108_S3	In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2013, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing.
898173_14_ITEM7_P108_S4	If the price of O Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.
898173_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	Vendor Concessions We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates.
898173_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory.
898173_14_ITEM7_P110_S2	Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns.
898173_14_ITEM7_P110_S3	Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations.
898173_14_ITEM7_P110_S4	Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations.
898173_14_ITEM7_P110_S5	The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
898173_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	Warranty Reserves We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties.
898173_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our vendors.
898173_14_ITEM7_P111_S2	Certain vendors provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims.
898173_14_ITEM7_P111_S3	For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims.
898173_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	Differences between vendor allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales.
898173_14_ITEM7_P112_S1	Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line.
898173_14_ITEM7_P112_S2	Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims.
898173_14_ITEM7_P112_S3	If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 3 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits.
898173_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim.
898173_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations.
898173_14_ITEM7_P114_S2	Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities.
898173_14_ITEM7_P114_S3	Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains.
898173_14_ITEM7_P114_S4	As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information.
898173_14_ITEM7_P114_S5	These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate.
898173_14_ITEM7_P114_S6	These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_14_ITEM7_P114_S7	We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities.
898173_14_ITEM7_P114_S8	If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 12 million or 1.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Closed Property Reserves We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations.
898173_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income.
898173_14_ITEM7_P115_S2	The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms.
898173_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions.
898173_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates.
898173_14_ITEM7_P116_S2	Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known.
898173_14_ITEM7_P116_S3	If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	Legal Reserves We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O Reilly is currently involved.
898173_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business.
898173_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	We resolved the governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK") and certain of CSK s former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the 2008 acquisition date.
898173_14_ITEM7_P117_S3	As a result of the acquisition, we incurred legal fees and costs related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations.
898173_14_ITEM7_P117_S4	Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK.
898173_14_ITEM7_P117_S5	Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures.
898173_14_ITEM7_P117_S6	If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
898173_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve.
898173_14_ITEM7_P118_S2	We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit.
898173_14_ITEM7_P118_S3	The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings.
898173_14_ITEM7_P118_S4	Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations.
898173_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented.
898173_14_ITEM7_P119_S1	The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates.
898173_14_ITEM7_P119_S2	Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position.
898173_14_ITEM7_P119_S3	While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority.
898173_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_14_ITEM7_P121_S1	As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.
898173_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_14_ITEM7_P122_S1	While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2013 and 2012.
898173_14_ITEM7_P123_S1	The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown.
898173_14_ITEM7_P123_S2	The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.
898173_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	(1) Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for each quarter and annual period.
898173_14_ITEM7_P124_S1	The quarterly earnings per share amounts may not sum to equal the full-year earnings per share.
898173_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	In July of 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists ( ASU 2013-11 ).
898173_14_ITEM7_P125_S1	Under ASU 2013-11, an entity is required to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.
898173_14_ITEM7_P125_S2	If a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.
898173_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	ASU 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM7_P126_S1	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2014; the application of this guidance affects presentation only and, therefore, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) with variable interest rates based on either a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Historically, we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates; however, as of December 31, 2013, we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $ 1.40 billion and $ 1.10 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
898173_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $ 1.41 billion and $ 1.20 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.
898173_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less.
898173_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal.
898173_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $ 231 million .
898173_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The management of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company ), under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) or 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
898173_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
898173_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	Internal control over financial reporting includes all policies and procedures that:
898173_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	Management recognizes that all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
898173_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
898173_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk.
898173_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
898173_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM8_P5_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992 framework).
898173_14_ITEM8_P5_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2013, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
898173_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	Ernst Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has audited the Company s consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein.
898173_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	We have audited O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria).
898173_14_ITEM8_P7_S1	Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
898173_14_ITEM8_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
898173_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
898173_14_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
898173_14_ITEM8_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
898173_14_ITEM8_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
898173_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
898173_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
898173_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
898173_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	In our opinion, O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria .
898173_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated February 28, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
898173_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries:
898173_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
898173_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
898173_14_ITEM8_P14_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
898173_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
898173_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
898173_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
898173_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
898173_14_ITEM8_P16_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
898173_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
898173_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

898173_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	The Company s stores carry an extensive product line, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and various automotive accessories.
898173_14_ITEM8_P24_S3	As of December 31, 2013, the Company owned and operated 4,166 stores in 42 states, servicing both the do-it-yourself ( DIY ) customer and the professional service provider.
898173_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company s robust distribution system provides stores with same-day or overnight access to an extensive inventory of hard-to-find items not typically stocked in the stores of other auto parts retailers.
898173_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Segment reporting: The Company is managed and operated by a single management team reporting to the chief operating decision maker.
898173_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	O'Reilly stores have similar characteristics including the nature of the products and services, the type and class of customers and the methods used to distribute products and provide service to its customers and, as a whole, make up a single operating segment.
898173_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company does not prepare discrete financial information with respect to product lines or geographic locations and as such has one reportable segment.
898173_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
898173_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
898173_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
898173_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
898173_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Cash equivalents: Cash equivalents include investments with maturities of 90 days or less on the date of purchase.
898173_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Accounts receivable: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company s customers to make required payments.
898173_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection is reasonably assured: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_14_ITEM8_P32_S2	Amounts due to the Company from its Team Members are included as a component of accounts receivable.
898173_14_ITEM8_P32_S3	These amounts consist primarily of purchases of merchandise on Team Member accounts.
898173_14_ITEM8_P32_S4	Accounts receivable due from Team Members was approximately $ 1.0 million and $ 2.1 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
898173_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company s pre-established credit requirements.
898173_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to these receivables are limited because the Company s customer base consists of a large number of small customers, spreading the credit risk across a broad base.
898173_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	The Company also controls this credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and accounts receivable and credit monitoring procedures.
898173_14_ITEM8_P33_S3	Generally, the Company does not require security when credit is granted to customers.
898173_14_ITEM8_P33_S4	Credit losses are provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements and have consistently been within management s expectations.
898173_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Amounts receivable from vendors: The Company receives concessions from its vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for new stores and warranties, volume purchase rebates and co-operative advertising.
898173_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to the Company s advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	All other vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory.
898173_14_ITEM8_P34_S3	Amounts receivable from vendors also includes amounts due to the Company for changeover merchandise and product returns.
898173_14_ITEM8_P34_S4	The Company regularly reviews vendor receivables for collectability and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectable amounts based on an evaluation of the Company s vendors financial positions and corresponding abilities to meet financial obligations.
898173_14_ITEM8_P34_S5	Management does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the Company will be unable to collect the amounts receivable from vendors and the Company did not record a reserve for uncollectable amounts from vendors in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 or 2012.
898173_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Inventory: Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	Inventory also includes capitalized costs related to procurement, warehousing and distribution centers ( DCs ).
898173_14_ITEM8_P35_S2	Cost has been determined using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method, which more accurately matches costs with related revenues.
898173_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	merchandise inventory purchases have increased, this has resulted in improved acquisition costs from its suppliers and the corresponding price deflation exhausted the Company's LIFO reserve balance during the year ended December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	The Company's policy is not to write up the value of its inventory in excess of its replacement cost.
898173_14_ITEM8_P36_S2	Accordingly, the Company's merchandise inventory is effectively being recorded at replacement cost as of December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM8_P36_S3	The replacement cost of inventory was $ 2.38 billion and $ 2.31 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
898173_14_ITEM8_P36_S4	LIFO costs exceeded replacement costs by $ 21.6 million at December 31, 2013.
898173_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Property and equipment: Property and equipment are carried at cost.
898173_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method generally over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
898173_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated economic life of the assets.
898173_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	The lease term includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception for which failure to execute renewal options would result in a substantial economic penalty to the Company.
898173_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
898173_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	Upon retirement or sale, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the gain or loss, if any, is included as a component of Other income (expense) in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income.
898173_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.

898173_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	The notes receivable, which bear interest at rates ranging from 0% to 10% , are due in varying amounts through March of 2019 .
898173_14_ITEM8_P42_S2	Interest income on notes receivable is recorded in accordance with the note terms to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected.
898173_14_ITEM8_P42_S3	The Company regularly reviews its notes receivable for collectability and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectable amounts based on an evaluation of the Company s borrowers financial positions and corresponding abilities to meet financial obligations.
898173_14_ITEM8_P42_S4	Management does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the Company will be unable to collect the notes receivable and the Company did not record a reserve for uncollectable notes receivable in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 or 2012.
898173_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	Goodwill and other intangibles: The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013 and 2012, include goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as the result of acquisitions.
898173_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values, rather than systematically amortizing goodwill against earnings.
898173_14_ITEM8_P43_S2	During 2013 and 2012, the goodwill impairment test included a quantitative assessment, which compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill.
898173_14_ITEM8_P43_S3	The Company operates as a single reporting unit, and the Company determined that its fair value exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012; as such, no goodwill impairment adjustment was required as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.
898173_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Finite-lived intangibles are carried at cost.
898173_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method, generally over the estimated useful lives of the intangibles.
898173_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Impairment of long-lived assets: The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
898173_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	When such an event occurs, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the asset (asset group) with the carrying amounts of the asset.
898173_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
898173_14_ITEM8_P45_S3	The Company has not historically recorded any material impairment to its long-lived assets and the Company did not record an impairment to its long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2013 or 2012.
898173_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	Self-insurance reserves: The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities for Team Member health care benefits, workers compensation, vehicle liability, general liability and property loss.
898173_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, the Company obtains third-party insurance coverage to limit its exposure.
898173_14_ITEM8_P46_S2	The Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_14_ITEM8_P46_S3	Certain of these liabilities were recorded at an estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate.
898173_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	The following table identifies the components of the Company s self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):
898173_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	The current portion of the Company s discounted self-insurance reserves totaled $ 57.7 million and $ 54.2 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
898173_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	The remainder was included within Other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.
898173_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	Warranties: The Company offers warranties on certain merchandise it sells with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties.
898173_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of the Company s vendors.
898173_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	Certain vendors provide upfront allowances to the Company in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims.
898173_14_ITEM8_P49_S3	For this merchandise, when sold, the Company bears the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims.
898173_14_ITEM8_P49_S4	Differences between vendor allowances received by the Company in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales.
898173_14_ITEM8_P49_S5	Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line.
898173_14_ITEM8_P49_S6	The Company s historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims to the Company has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims.
898173_14_ITEM8_P49_S7	See Note 9 for further information concerning the Company s aggregate product warranty liability.
898173_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	O Reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company s business.

898173_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	The Company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred on pending litigation matters.
898173_14_ITEM8_P50_S3	Although the Company cannot ascertain the total amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, the Company does not currently believe that in the aggregate, taking into account applicable insurance coverage, these matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	In addition, O Reilly was involved in resolving legacy governmental investigations and litigation commenced by the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) against CSK Automotive Corporation ( CSK ) and certain former CSK employees arising out of alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the Company s acquisition of CSK in 2008; as a result, O Reilly incurred legal fees and costs related to potential indemnification obligations.

898173_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Closed property liabilities: The Company maintains reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations.
898173_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	The Company provides for these liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the close date, net of estimated sublease income.
898173_14_ITEM8_P52_S2	In conjunction with the acquisition of CSK, the Company s reserves include purchase accounting liabilities related to acquired properties that were no longer being utilized in the acquired business as well as the Company s planned exit activities.
898173_14_ITEM8_P52_S3	See Note 7 for further information concerning these closed property liabilities.
898173_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Derivative instruments and hedging activities: The Company s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether the instruments meet the criteria for designation as cash flow or fair value hedges.
898173_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	The criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the assessment of the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction, matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction and the probability that the underlying transaction will occur.
898173_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	A designated hedge of the exposure to variability in the future cash flows of an asset or a liability qualifies as a cash flow hedge.
898173_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	A designated hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability qualifies as a fair value hedge.
898173_14_ITEM8_P54_S2	For derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation, the Company would recognize the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss and would reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same income statement line item as the impact of the hedged transaction.
898173_14_ITEM8_P54_S3	For derivatives with fair value hedge accounting designation, the Company would recognize gains or losses from the change in fair value of these derivatives, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item, in earnings.
898173_14_ITEM8_P54_S4	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company did not hold any instruments that qualified as cash flow or fair value hedge derivatives.

898173_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	These debt issuance costs have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the corresponding debt issue and the amortization expense is included as a component of Interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
898173_14_ITEM8_P69_S2	Deferred debt issuance costs totaled $ 11.5 million and $ 10.1 million , net of amortization, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of which $ 1.6 million and $ 1.5 million were included within Other current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, with the remainder included within Other assets, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.
898173_14_ITEM8_P69_S3	See Note 5 for further information concerning debt issuance costs associated with the issuances of or amendments to long-term debt instruments.
898173_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	Income taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.
898173_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the GAAP basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rules and rates currently scheduled to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.

898173_14_ITEM8_P70_S5	The Company did not establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, as it was considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets were realizable through a combination of future taxable income, the realization of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies.
898173_14_ITEM8_P70_S6	The Company regularly reviews its potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit.
898173_14_ITEM8_P70_S7	The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings.
898173_14_ITEM8_P70_S8	Changes in the Company s tax liability may occur in the future as its assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations.
898173_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented.
898173_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	The estimates of the Company s potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the Company s various tax positions and actual results could differ from estimates.
898173_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal period.
898173_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus, the common stock equivalents associated with the potential impact of dilutive stock options.
898173_14_ITEM8_P72_S2	Certain common stock equivalents that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, were not included in the fully diluted computation because they would have been antidilutive.
898173_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Generally, stock options are antidilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation when the exercise price exceeds the market price of the common shares.

898173_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	These risk factors include, among others, deteriorating economic conditions, competition in the automotive aftermarket business, our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, future growth assurance, our dependence upon key and other personnel, our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products, our acquisition strategies, complications in our distribution centers ("DCs"), failure to achieve high levels of services and products, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, our increased debt levels, a downgrade in our credit ratings, data security, and environmental legislation and other regulations.
898173_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy.
898173_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O'Reilly values, including customer service and expense control.
898173_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	Our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve, by providing superior customer service and significant value to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution systems and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages which cannot be easily duplicated.
898173_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	Proven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy:
898173_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	For more than 35 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage.
898173_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts, capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors, and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	In 2014 , we derived approximately 58% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 42% of our sales from our professional service provider customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	We believe we will continue to increase our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation, the opportunities for growth in our less mature markets, and our systems, knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, supported by our approximately 700 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer.
898173_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business over our competitors who do not have the same historical track record of serving the professional service provider.
898173_15_ITEM1_P11_S3	We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on the growth of our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy.
898173_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Superior Customer Service: We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products.
898173_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe that the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the specific automotive products requested.
898173_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	Accordingly, each O'Reilly store carries a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications.
898173_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management's assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.
898173_15_ITEM1_P12_S4	We have no material backorders for the products we sell.
898173_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	We seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below:
898173_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Technically Proficient Professional Parts People: Our highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators.
898173_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be technically knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard parts, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis.
898173_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People.
898173_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	We believe our commitment to a robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network.
898173_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our strategic regional tiered distribution network includes DCs and Hub stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management.
898173_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	We currently operate 26 regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 146,000 stock keeping units ("SKUs"), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P15_S4	To augment our robust DC network, we operate 283 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to an average of 41,000 SKUs to other stores within the surrounding area.
898173_15_ITEM1_P15_S5	We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.
898173_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Experienced Management Team: Our Company philosophy is to "promote from within" and the vast majority of our senior management, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company.
898173_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience.
898173_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	We have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 166 professionals who average 18 years of service; 228 corporate managers who average 16 years of service; and 429 district managers who average 12 years of service.
898173_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 22 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993.
898173_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Aggressively Open New Stores: We intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket.
898173_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	During 2014 , we opened 200 net, new stores and we plan to open approximately 205 net, new stores in 2015 , which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets.
898173_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O'Reilly stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	We typically open new stores by (i) constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory, (ii) acquiring an independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store, or (iii) purchasing multi-store chains.
898173_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	New store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities, competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius, and the operational strength of such competitors.
898173_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network.
898173_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets.
898173_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.
898173_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Grow Sales in Existing Stores: Profitable same store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy.
898173_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O'Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability.
898173_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions: The automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, such as ourselves, to operate more efficiently and proficiently than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation.
898173_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets.
898173_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Continually Enhance Store Design and Location: Our current prototype store design features enhancements such as optimized square footage, higher ceilings, more convenient interior store layouts, improved in-store signage, brighter lighting, increased parking availability and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance overall customer service.
898173_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance.
898173_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	During 2014 , we relocated 29 stores and renovated 58 stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	in same store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best serve our customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Continually Enhance the Growth and Functionality of Our E-Commerce Website: Our user-friendly website, www.oreillyauto.com , allows our customers to search product and repair content, check the in-store availability of our products, and place orders for either home delivery or in-store pickup.
898173_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	We continue to enhance the functionality of our website to provide our customers with a friendly and convenient shopping experience, as well as a robust product and repair content information resource, which will continue to build the O'Reilly Brand.
898173_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	As of January 31, 2015 , we employed 67,926 Team Members ( 33,779 full-time Team Members and 34,147 part-time Team Members), of whom 57,887 were employed at our stores, 7,085 were employed at our DCs and 2,954 were employed at our corporate and regional offices.
898173_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	A union represents 50 stores ( 569 Team Members) in the Greater Bay Area in California and has for many years.
898173_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	In addition, approximately 61 Team Members who drive over-the-road trucks in two of our DCs are represented by a labor union.
898173_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	Except for these Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions.
898173_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	Our tradition for 58 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our "Live Green" Culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member's contribution to the success of O'Reilly.
898173_15_ITEM1_P26_S4	This focus on professionalism and fairness has created an industry-leading team, and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent.
898173_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are identified below:
898173_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	the type and size of store that should be developed.
898173_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale.
898173_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas.
898173_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	As these store clusters mature, we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas.
898173_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.
898173_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Store Locations and Size: As a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	Our stores, on average, carry approximately 23,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,200 total square feet in size.
898173_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	At December 31, 2014 , we had a total of approximately 32 million square feet in our 4,366 stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 146,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 283 Hub stores, which, on average, carry approximately 41,000 SKUs and average approximately 10,000 square feet in size.
898173_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	We believe that our stores are ''destination stores'' generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity.
898173_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares, and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	The following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
898173_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Store Layout: We utilize a computer-assisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent retail merchandise presentation and customize our hard-parts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area.
898173_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access, maximum selling space and to prominently display high-turnover products and accessories to customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	To ensure the best customer experience possible, we have selectively implemented bilingual in-store signage based on the demographics in each store's geographic area.
898173_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Aisle displays and end caps are used to feature high-demand, seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.
898173_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Store Automation: To enhance store-level operations, customer service and reliability, we use Linux servers and IBM I-Series computer systems in our stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	These systems are linked with the I-Series computers located in each of our DCs.
898173_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	Our point-of-sale system provides immediate access to our electronic catalog, part images, schematics and pricing information by make, model and year of vehicle and uses barcode scanning technology to price our merchandise.
898173_15_ITEM1_P35_S3	This system speeds transaction times, reduces the customer's checkout time, ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service.
898173_15_ITEM1_P35_S4	Moreover, our store automation systems capture detailed sales information which assists in store management, strategic planning, inventory control and distribution efficiency.
898173_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store.
898173_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Each of our 429 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten stores, which provides our stores with a strong amount of operational support.
898173_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model.
898173_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	Store and district managers also receive continuous training through online assignments, field workshops, regional meetings and our annual managers' conference.
898173_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through incentive compensation programs.
898173_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	Under our incentive compensation programs, base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability.
898173_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	In addition, each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs, and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store's performance.
898173_15_ITEM1_P38_S3	We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store Team Members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.
898173_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	We believe our highly trained team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	A significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers; therefore, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products.
898173_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from Professional Parts People, particularly when purchasing hard parts.
898173_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.
898173_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	We screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs, or automotive aptitude.
898173_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company, as well as the requirements for their specific job position.
898173_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide the highest level of service to our customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P40_S3	Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O'Reilly Certified Parts Professional test.
898173_15_ITEM1_P40_S4	Passing the O'Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE).
898173_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	All of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager.
898173_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	Afterward, these Team Members spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P41_S3	Additionally, each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.
898173_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	We believe that our tiered distribution model provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions, while lowering our inventory carrying costs and controlling inventory.
898173_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	network allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network.
898173_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	Our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each DC.
898173_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , we had a total growth capacity of over 800 stores in our distribution center network.
898173_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Distribution Centers: As of December 31, 2014 , we operated 26 DCs comprised of approximately 10.0 million operating square feet (see the "Properties" table in Item 2 of this Form 10-K for a detailed listing of DC operating square footages).
898173_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our DCs electronically receive orders from computers located in each of our stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	Our DCs stock an average of 146,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional DCs' on-hand inventory.
898173_15_ITEM1_P44_S3	Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to all of our stores in the continental United States.
898173_15_ITEM1_P44_S4	In addition, stores within an individual DC's metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC's "city counter," most of which receive this service seven days per week.
898173_15_ITEM1_P44_S5	Our DCs also provide weekend service not only to stores they service via their city counters, but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute to surrounding stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P44_S6	Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	As part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2015 , we plan to:
898173_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	make proven, return-on-investment based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs including conveyor systems, picking modules and lift equipment.
898173_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Hub stores: We currently operate 283 strategically located Hub stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis.
898173_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our Hub stores average approximately 10,000 square feet and carry an average of 41,000 SKUs.
898173_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of brand name, house brands and private label products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks.
898173_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, BWD, Cardone, Castrol, Gates Rubber, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Quaker State, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix.
898173_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	In addition to name brand products, our stores carry a wide variety of high-quality proprietary private label products under our BestTest , BrakeBest , Import Direct , Master Pro , Micro-Gard , Murray , Omnispark , O'Reilly Auto Parts , Precision , Power Torque , Super Start , and Ultima brands.
898173_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	Our proprietary private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers and meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and provide a great combination of quality and value a characteristic important to our DIY customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	We have no long-term contractual purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts.
898173_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs, for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell.
898173_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P49_S3	We have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases.
898173_15_ITEM1_P49_S4	As a whole, we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good.
898173_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 500 suppliers, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 23% of our total purchases in 2014 .
898173_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our largest supplier in 2014 accounted for approximately 6% of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3% to 5% of our total purchases.
898173_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	Marketing to the DIY Customer: We use an integrated marketing program, which includes radio, direct mail and newspaper distribution, in-store, online, and social media promotions, and sports and event sponsorships, to aggressively attract DIY customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	The marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the O'Reilly Brand across our geographic footprint.
898173_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	We also utilize a problem-resolution communication strategy, which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles, protecting their long-term automotive investment and establishing O'Reilly as their partner for auto parts needs.
898173_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	To stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts, who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public, we sponsored multiple nationally-televised races and over 1,300 grassroots, local and regional motorsports events throughout 42 states during 2014 .
898173_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	National series events in Texas and three National Hot Rod Association ("NHRA") races across the country.
898173_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	During the fall and winter months, we strategically sponsor National Collegiate Athletic Association ("NCAA") basketball.
898173_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	Our relationships with over 30 NCAA teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently displayed O'Reilly logos on TV-visible signs throughout the season.
898173_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	We target Spanish speaking auto parts customers through marketing efforts that include the use of Spanish language radio, print, and outdoor advertising, as well as sponsorships of over 45 local and regional festivals and events.
898173_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	As consumers increasingly turn to the Internet for information and offers, we continue to invest in digital channels to expand the O'Reilly brand presence online and through mobile devices.
898173_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	Search engine optimization strategies are used to drive traffic to our website and popular social media platforms are used to provide excellent customer service through interaction and dialogue with our customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	In 2014, we continued our O'Reilly O'Rewards DIY customer loyalty program, with a total of over 12 million customers enrolled.
898173_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	The program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points toward coupons, which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	The programs allow us to reward our customers for their continued business, as well as enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business and target promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns.
898173_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	Marketing to the Professional Service Provider Customer: We have approximately 700 full-time O'Reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our First Call program.
898173_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	Each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon, selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	Targeted marketing materials such as flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers, paint and body shops and fleet customers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P58_S3	Our industry-leading First Call program enables our sales representatives, district managers, and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services identified below:
898173_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	Marketing to the Independently Owned Parts Store: Along with the daily operation and management of the DCs and the distribution of automotive products to our stores, Ozark Automotive Distributors, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary ("Ozark"), also sells automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores ("jobber stores") throughout our trade areas.
898173_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	These jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an O'Reilly store.
898173_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	Ozark administers a dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	We currently provide automotive products to approximately 181 jobber stores, who participate in our proprietary jobber service program called Parts City Auto Parts program, with total annual sales of approximately $60 million .
898173_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	As a participant in these programs, a jobber store, which meets certain financial and operational standards, is permitted to indicate its Parts City Auto Parts membership through the display of trademarked logo that is owned by Ozark.
898173_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	In return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from Ozark, we provide computer software for business management, competitive pricing, advertising, marketing and sales assistance to Parts City Auto Parts affiliate stores.
898173_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	We believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business.
898173_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store.
898173_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	Most automotive products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of internal gross margin targets with additional savings offered on some items through volume discounts and special promotional pricing and competitor price comparisons.
898173_15_ITEM1_P64_S2	Consistent with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any in-stock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area.
898173_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our stores accept cash, checks, debit and credit cards.
898173_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	We also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our pre-established credit requirements.
898173_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	Some of the factors considered in our pre-established credit requirements include customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_15_ITEM1_P65_S3	No customer accounted for greater than one percent of our consolidated net sales, nor do we have any dependence on any single customer.
898173_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	We accept product returns for new products, core products and warranty/defective products.
898173_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	The automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale.
898173_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	The total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $246 billion , according to The Auto Care Association.
898173_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	This market is made up of four segments: labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales and tire sales.
898173_15_ITEM1_P67_S3	O'Reilly's addressable market within this industry is approximately $140 billion , which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and DIY sales.
898173_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations.
898173_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	The sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition and price.
898173_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market.
898173_15_ITEM1_P69_S2	We compete primarily with the stores identified below:
898173_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout and convenient and accessible store locations.
898173_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	Our dual market strategy requires significant capital to support, such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.
898173_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	We have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	To the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_15_ITEM1_P71_S2	As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
898173_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	To some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Store sales, profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	We are subject to federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, including those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.
898173_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our oil and battery recycling programs.
898173_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party suppliers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P75_S2	The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our Team Members, deposited into supplier-provided containers and pallets, and then disposed of by the third-party suppliers.
898173_15_ITEM1_P75_S3	In general, our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the supplier.
898173_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date.
898173_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	However, we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.

898173_15_ITEM1_P103_S0	Solely for convenience, our service marks and trademarks may appear in this report without the or symbol, which is not intended to indicate that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the right to these service marks and trademarks.

898173_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Many of these factors are outside of our control.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our customers' purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P1_S5	If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the U.S., the total number of registered vehicles in the U.S., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the U.S.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Also, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	If third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Both the DIY and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	For a list of our principal competitors, see the "Competition" section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to DIY customers.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers' automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In addition, our stores and DCs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We cannot assure future growth will be achieved.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2015 and beyond will be achieved.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	For a discussion of our growth strategies, see the "Growth Strategy" section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Our business, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient, and as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P7_S7	For a discussion of our management, see the "Business" section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers' ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	For example, financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In addition, the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers, as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries, may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to, or difficulties in the, manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following:
898173_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	we may fail, or be unable to, discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, the subsequent owner or operator, may be liable.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, operability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters or the threat of them, may result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers ("DCs") or other facilities, or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	This may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or other catastrophic events.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We believe our Company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Brand value is based, in large part, on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or Team Members.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of acquired businesses will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	If we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our stock price would likely suffer.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts' expectations.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	For example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things:
898173_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	expose us to fluctuations in interest rates.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In addition, the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	A downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes, as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These ratings are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	A downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our credit facility.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	A downgrade could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our notes, preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In addition, a downgrade could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business, adversely affecting our cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	A breach of customer, Team Member or Company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and Team Members.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Litigation, governmental proceedings, environmental legislation and regulations and employment laws and regulations may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings, arising out of the ordinary course of our business.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Environmental legislation and regulations, like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change, could adversely impact all industries.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	While it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, by, among other things, increasing fuel prices.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our business is subject to employment laws and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as minimum wage legislation.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	A violation of or change in employment laws and/or regulations could hinder our ability to control costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by Congress and state legislatures, significantly impacts our healthcare cost structure and increases our healthcare-related expenses.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We continue to evaluate potential additional impacts the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate such impact, including potential further modifications to our current benefit plans, operational changes to minimize the effect of the legislation on our cost structure and increases to selling prices to mitigate the expected increase in healthcare-related expenses.
898173_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If we cannot effectively modify our programs and operations in response to the new legislation, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.
898173_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Distribution centers, stores, and other properties As of December 31, 2014 , we operated 26 regional distribution centers ("DC"s), of which eight were leased ( 2.8 million operating square footage) and 18 were owned ( 7.2 million operating square footage) for total DC operating square footage of 10.0 million square feet.
898173_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	The following table provides information regarding our DCs, returns facility and corporate offices as of December 31, 2014 :
898173_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) Includes floor and mezzanine operating square footage, excludes subleased square footage.
898173_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	(2) Occupied under the terms of a lease with an affiliated party.
898173_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	The leased facilities typically require a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expenses and have an original term of, at a minimum, 20 years, subject to one five-year renewal at our option.
898173_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	One of our bulk facilities is leased from an entity owned by an affiliated director's immediate family.
898173_15_ITEM2_P3_S0	maintenance expenses and an original term of 15 years, subject to three five-year renewals at our option.
898173_15_ITEM2_P3_S1	We believe that this lease agreement with the affiliated entity is on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.
898173_15_ITEM2_P4_S0	Of the 4,366 stores that we operated at December 31, 2014 , 1,612 stores were owned, 2,677 stores were leased from unaffiliated parties and 77 stores were leased from entities in which certain of our affiliated directors, members of our affiliated director's immediate family, or our executive officers, are affiliated.
898173_15_ITEM2_P4_S1	Leases with unaffiliated parties generally provide for payment of a fixed base rent, payment of certain tax, insurance and maintenance expenses and an original term of, at a minimum, 10 years, subject to one or more renewals at our option.
898173_15_ITEM2_P4_S2	We have entered into separate master lease agreements with each of the affiliated entities for the occupancy of the stores covered thereby.
898173_15_ITEM2_P4_S3	Such master lease agreements with three of the eight affiliated entities have been modified to extend the term of the lease agreement for specific stores.
898173_15_ITEM2_P4_S4	The master lease agreements or modifications thereto expire on dates ranging from November 30, 2016 , to September 30, 2031 .
898173_15_ITEM2_P4_S5	We believe that the lease agreements with the affiliated entities are on terms comparable to those obtainable from third parties.
898173_15_ITEM2_P5_S0	We believe that our present facilities are in good condition, are adequately insured and are adequate for the conduct of our current operations.
898173_15_ITEM2_P5_S1	The store servicing capability of our 26 existing DCs is approximately 5,200 stores, providing a growth capacity of more than 800 stores.
898173_15_ITEM2_P5_S2	We believe the growth capacity in our 26 existing DCs will provide us with the DC infrastructure needed for near-term expansion.
898173_15_ITEM2_P5_S3	However, as we expand our geographic footprint, we will continue to evaluate our existing distribution system infrastructure and will adjust our distribution system capacity as needed to support our future growth.
898173_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	O'Reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company's business.
898173_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Company records reserves for litigation losses in instances where a material adverse outcome is probable and the Company is able to reasonably estimate the probable loss.
898173_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	The Company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred in pending litigation matters.
898173_15_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, it does not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters, taking into account applicable insurance and reserves, will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.
898173_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	The Company received a subpoena from the District Attorney of the County of Alameda, along with other environmental prosecutorial offices in the state of California, seeking documents and information related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste.
898173_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	Management has an ongoing and open dialogue with these agencies regarding this matter and is cooperating fully with the request; however, at this time a prediction of the ultimate outcome of these efforts cannot be determined.
898173_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	In addition, O'Reilly was involved in resolving governmental investigations that were being conducted against CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK") and CSK's former officers and other litigation, prior to its acquisition by O'Reilly in 2008, as described below.
898173_15_ITEM3_P2_S1	As previously reported all governmental investigations and litigation related to these CSK legacy issues, both civil and criminal, have concluded.
898173_15_ITEM3_P2_S2	However, under Delaware law, the charter documents of the CSK entities, and certain indemnification agreements, CSK may have certain indemnification obligations.
898173_15_ITEM3_P2_S3	As a result of the CSK acquisition, O'Reilly has incurred legal fees and costs related to these potential indemnification obligations arising from the litigation commenced by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission against CSK's former employees.
898173_15_ITEM3_P2_S4	Whether those legal fees and costs are covered by CSK's insurance is subject to uncertainty, and, given its complexity and scope, the final outcome cannot be predicted at this time.
898173_15_ITEM3_P2_S5	O'Reilly has a remaining reserve, with respect to the indemnification obligations of $12 million at December 31, 2014 , which relates to the payment of those legal fees and costs already incurred.
898173_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	It is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the Company's results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by resolution of such matter, depending, in part, upon the results of operations and cash flows for such period.
898173_15_ITEM3_P3_S1	However, at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter, after consideration of applicable reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

898173_15_ITEM5_P5_S1	The Company may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_15_ITEM5_P5_S2	As announced on February 5, 2014, August 13, 2014, and February 4, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under the share repurchase program by an additional $500 million , resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $5.0 billion .

898173_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States.
898173_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment.
898173_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer.
898173_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects "good," "better," and "best" alternatives.
898173_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the "best" quality category of products.
898173_15_ITEM7_P6_S5	Consumers' willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry.
898173_15_ITEM7_P6_S6	Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops.
898173_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we operated 4,366 stores in 43 states.
898173_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits, and competition.
898173_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	During challenging macroeconomic conditions, we believe that the average consumer's tendency has been to "trade down" to lower quality products.
898173_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers' changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of "purchasing up" on the value spectrum.
898173_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.
898173_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.
898173_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	According to the Department of Transportation, prior to 2007, the annual number of total miles driven in the U.S. had steadily increased; however, between 2008 and 2013, as the U.S. experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions and historically high levels of unemployment, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. remained relatively flat.
898173_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	As the U.S. economy began to recover in 2014, miles driven also improved and through November of 2014, year-to-date total miles driven in the U.S. increased 1.4%.
898173_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	We believe that as the U.S. economy continues to recover and the level of unemployment continues to decline, total miles driven in the U.S. will continue to increase and return to the historical trend of long-term annual growth.
898173_15_ITEM7_P10_S4	In addition, vehicles in the U.S. continue to be driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and continued demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.
898173_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 6% from 2003 to 2013, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 249 million by the end of 2013.
898173_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. was approximately 17 million , contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road.
898173_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	During the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from just 5.2% to 5.7% annually.
898173_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	The stable scrappage rates over the past decade have contributed to an increase in the average age of the U.S. vehicle population over that period, growing 16% , from 9.7 years in 2003 to 11.3 years in 2013.
898173_15_ITEM7_P11_S5	We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer's willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles.
898173_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty.
898173_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles.
898173_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Unemployment - Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending.
898173_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Long-term trends of high unemployment could impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	However, as of December 31, 2014 , the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 5.6% , its lowest rate in over six years.
898173_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	We believe that as the economy continues to recover, total employment should increase and we would expect to see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work.
898173_15_ITEM7_P13_S4	Aided by the anticipated increase in commuter miles, we believe overall annual U.S. miles driven should return to a period of annual growth, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O'Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.
898173_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:
898173_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	On January 26, 2015, Standard and Poor's Ratings Services raised all of its ratings on the Company, which moved the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility applicable rate to the tier one pricing level, thus reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins on borrowings of Eurodollar Rate loans.
898173_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Under the Company's share repurchase program, as approved by the Board of Directors in January of 2011, the Company may, from time to time, repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The Company and its Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	As announced on February 5, 2014, August 13, 2014, and February 4, 2015, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $500 million , resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $5.0 billion .
898173_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	Each additional $500 million authorization is each effective for a three -year period beginning on their respective announcement date.
898173_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	As of February 27, 2015, the Company had repurchased approximately 46.5 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $4.2 billion under this program.
898173_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 :
898173_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased $567 million to $7.22 billion from $6.65 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9% .
898173_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 6.0% and 4.3% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
898173_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members.
898173_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 (in millions):
898173_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2014, Compared to the Same Period in 2013 Store sales:
898173_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 , was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	of the continued growth of the more costly, hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales.
898173_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	The overall growth in our hard part categories continues to be driven by our faster growing professional service provider sales, which are primarily comprised of hard part categories and by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles.
898173_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the replacement parts is, on average, greater.
898173_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	While the less frequent repairs required by these better engineered and manufactured vehicles does create pressure on transaction counts, both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts were positive for the year ended December 31, 2014.
898173_15_ITEM7_P25_S4	The increases in professional service provider customer transaction counts were primarily driven by our acquired markets and the continued growth of less mature stores.
898173_15_ITEM7_P25_S5	The increases in DIY transaction counts were driven by our ongoing focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, including nights and weekends.
898173_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	We opened 200 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to 190 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
898173_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	At December 31, 2014 , we operated 4,366 stores in 43 states compared to 4,166 stores in 42 states at December 31, 2013 .
898173_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	We anticipate total new store growth to increase to 205 net, new store openings in 2015 .
898173_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $3.71 billion (or 51.4% of sales) from $3.37 billion (or 50.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 10% .
898173_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores.
898173_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, partially offset by the non-cash last-in, first-out ("LIFO") negative impact resulting from continued product acquisition cost reductions.
898173_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs.
898173_15_ITEM7_P27_S4	During the third quarter of 2013, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve due to acquisition cost improvements we realized over time.
898173_15_ITEM7_P27_S5	Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and, accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost.
898173_15_ITEM7_P27_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2014, our LIFO cost was written down by approximately $41 million to reflect replacement cost.
898173_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $2.44 billion (or 33.8% of sales) from $2.27 billion (or 34.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8% .
898173_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count.
898173_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.
898173_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $1.27 billion (or 17.6% of sales) from $1.10 billion (or 16.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15% .
898173_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $48 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $45 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8% .
898173_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 , was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings.
898173_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $444 million ( 36.3% effective tax rate) from $389 million ( 36.7% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 14% .
898173_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes was the result of higher taxable income in the current year, driven by our strong operating results.
898173_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to increased benefits from employment tax credits in the current year.
898173_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $778 million (or 10.8% of sales), from $670 million (or 10.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 16% .
898173_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased 22% to $7.34 on 106 million shares from $6.03 on 111 million shares for the same period one year ago.
898173_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased $467 million to $6.65 billion from $6.18 billion for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 8%.
898173_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.3% and 3.8% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
898173_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from the VIP Parts, Tires Service ("VIP") stores acquired on December 31, 2012, due to the significant change in the business model and lack of historical data.
898173_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in millions):
898173_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2013, Compared to the Same Period in 2012 Store sales:
898173_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provided incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2013, was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both DIY and professional service provider business, and an increase in customer transaction counts for professional service provider business, slightly offset by a small decrease in customer transaction counts for DIY business.
898173_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	The improvements in average ticket values were the result of the continued growth of the more costly hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales.
898173_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	The overall growth in the hard part categories continues to be driven by the increasing cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles.
898173_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the replacement parts is, on average, greater.
898173_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts are negatively impacted by these less frequent repairs.
898173_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	The increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts were driven by the chain wide growth of our professional business, while macroeconomic pressures on disposable income continue to negatively impact DIY customer transaction counts.
898173_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	We opened 190 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 180 net, new stores and 56 acquired stores for the year ended December 31, 2012.
898173_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	At December 31, 2013, we operated 4,166 stores in 42 states compared to 3,976 stores in 42 states at December 31, 2012.
898173_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $3.37 billion (or 50.7% of sales) from $3.10 billion (or 50.1% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 9%.
898173_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores.
898173_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to acquisition cost improvements, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution system efficiencies, partially offset by a smaller amount of capitalized distribution costs for the year ended December 31, 2013, the non-cash negative impact to gross margin resulting from the depletion of LIFO reserve and the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix.
898173_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	Acquisition cost improvements were the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs.
898173_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Distribution system efficiencies were the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs.
898173_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	The decrease in capitalized distribution costs for the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the larger than typical benefit from capitalized distribution costs in 2012 associated with our initiative to increase our store-level inventories.
898173_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores in 2012 were more efficient than routine restocking activity; as a result, we realized a larger than normal benefit from capitalized distribution costs.
898173_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	The complete depletion of our LIFO reserve during the year resulted from the acquisition cost improvements we realized over time.
898173_15_ITEM7_P41_S4	Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and, accordingly, we began effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost in 2013.
898173_15_ITEM7_P41_S5	During 2013, our LIFO cost was written down by approximately $21.6 million to reflect replacement cost in 2013.
898173_15_ITEM7_P41_S6	Professional service provider sales grew at a faster rate than DIY sales and professional service provider sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers; therefore, outsized growth in professional service provider sales, as compared to DIY, creates pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales.
898173_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $2.27 billion (or 34.1% of sales) from $2.12 billion (or 34.3% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 7%.
898173_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count.
898173_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of improved leverage of store payroll and occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.
898173_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $1.10 billion (or 16.6% of sales) from $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 13%.
898173_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $45 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $36 million (or 0.6% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 24%.
898173_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily due to increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings.
898173_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $389 million (36.7% effective tax rate) from $356 million (37.8% effective tax rate) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 9%.
898173_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income.
898173_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefits of employment tax credits realized in 2013, adjustments to tax reserves related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits during 2013 and unfavorable adjustments relating to certain income tax audits in 2012.
898173_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $670 million (or 10.1% of sales), from $586 million (or 9.5% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 14%.
898173_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased 27% to $6.03 on 111 million shares from $4.75 on 123 million shares for the same period one year prior.
898173_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program.
898173_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
898173_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations.
898173_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
898173_15_ITEM7_P48_S4	We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
898173_15_ITEM7_P48_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels.
898173_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):
898173_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.
898173_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	(2) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.
898173_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Current assets increased 8% and current liabilities increased 17% from 2013 to 2014 .
898173_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	The increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory, resulting from the opening of 200 net, new stores.
898173_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable, resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings supported in part by our suppliers and additional supplier participation in our enhanced supplier financing program during the year, which allowed us to obtain more favorable payment terms.
898173_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 94.6% as of December 31, 2014 , as compared to 86.6% in the prior year.
898173_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):
898173_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	(a) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period.
898173_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Operating activities: The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a greater decrease in net inventory investment and larger increases in net income and accrued payroll-related liabilities in 2014 as compared to 2013.
898173_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers.
898173_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced supplier financing programs.
898173_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	Our supplier financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers.
898173_15_ITEM7_P55_S3	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 94.6% , 86.6% and 84.7% as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
898173_15_ITEM7_P55_S4	The larger increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2014 was driven by continued strong supplier support.
898173_15_ITEM7_P55_S5	The increase in accrued payroll-related liabilities during 2014, as compared to 2013, was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates and timing of payments for employer obligations under certain benefit plans.
898173_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a smaller increase in income taxes payable, offset in part by an increase in net income for the year.
898173_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 86.6%, 84.7% and 64.4% at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
898173_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	The smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2013 is the result of a smaller increase in the number of new suppliers added to our financing programs versus the prior year.
898173_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	We launched our enhanced supplier financing program in January of 2011, and were able to add a large number of suppliers to the program during 2011 and 2012.
898173_15_ITEM7_P56_S4	The smaller increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of a prepaid tax position at the beginning of 2012 versus a payable position at the beginning of 2013.
898173_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Investing activities: The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during 2014 related to the mix of owned versus leased new stores as compared to the prior year, as well as an increase in the number of new store openings.
898173_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Total capital expenditures were $430 million and $396 million in 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
898173_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during 2013 related to the purchase and construction of new distribution facilities during 2013 to support our ongoing store growth, as well as an increase in the number of new store openings.
898173_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Total capital expenditures were $396 million and $301 million in 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
898173_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	We opened 200 , 190 , and 180 net, new stores in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively, and acquired 56 stores in 2012.
898173_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	We plan to open 205 net, new stores in 2015 .
898173_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million ; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.
898173_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Financing activities: The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term senior notes during 2013, partially offset by the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during the current year under our share repurchase program.
898173_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during 2013 under our share repurchase program.
898173_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Unsecured revolving credit facility: On January 14, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of September 9, 2011, and as further amended by Amendment No. 2 dated as of July 2, 2013 (the "Credit Agreement").
898173_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	The Credit Agreement provides for a $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Facility") arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in July of 2018.
898173_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	The Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings.
898173_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million .
898173_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	We had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers' compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $48 million and $52 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by those amounts.
898173_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Senior Notes: We have issued $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due between 2021 and 2023 with United Missouri Bank, N.A. as trustee.
898173_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Interest on the unsecured senior notes of 3.800% to 4.875% is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year.
898173_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's subsidiaries ("Subsidiary Guarantors") that incurs or guarantees obligations under our Credit Agreement or under other credit facility or capital markets debt of ours or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors.
898173_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the Subsidiary Guarantor's guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all the property of, the Subsidiary Guarantor.
898173_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries.
898173_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries.
898173_15_ITEM7_P65_S4	Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law.
898173_15_ITEM7_P65_S5	Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31, 2014 .
898173_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures.
898173_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.
898173_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.25 times from March 31, 2013, through December 31, 2014, and 2.50 times thereafter through maturity, and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times through maturity.
898173_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense ("EBITDAR").
898173_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt.
898173_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders.
898173_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.36 times and 4.98 times as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.72 times and 1.90 times as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.
898173_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio range of 2.00 times to 2.25 times.
898173_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
898173_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
898173_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement.
898173_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_15_ITEM7_P71_S4	Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_15_ITEM7_P71_S5	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Share repurchase program: Under our share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	We may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	February 4, 2015, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $500 million , resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $5.0 billion .
898173_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	Each additional $500 million authorization is effective for a three -year period beginning on their respective announcement date.
898173_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data):
898173_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we had $279 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
898173_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 27, 2015 , we repurchased an additional 0.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $197.48 , for a total investment of $28 million .
898173_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	We have repurchased a total of 46 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 27, 2015 , at an average price of $91.38 for a total aggregate investment of $4.2 billion .
898173_15_ITEM7_P75_S3	As of February 27, 2015 , we had approximately $752 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
898173_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 , included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 "Leasing," Note 9 "Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans" and Note 10 "Commitments" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment's cancellation terms.
898173_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2015 , which are included in "Current liabilities" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
898173_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 13 "Income Taxes" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the realized deferred income taxes' ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined.
898173_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , we recorded a net liability of $58 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of "Other liabilities".
898173_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor's Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.
898173_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above.
898173_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.125% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor's Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.
898173_15_ITEM7_P79_S3	Based on our credit ratings at December 31, 2014, our margin for Base Rate loans was 0.000% , our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans was 0.975% and our facility fee was 0.150% .
898173_15_ITEM7_P79_S4	As of December 31, 2014 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_15_ITEM7_P79_S5	Based upon our current credit ratings, our current margin for Base Rate loans is 0.000% , our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 0.875% and our facility fee is 0.125% (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year.
898173_15_ITEM7_P79_S6	These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments.
898173_15_ITEM7_P79_S7	(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits.
898173_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount.
898173_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_15_ITEM7_P80_S2	(4) The projected obligation related to future payments under the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the timing of which cannot be estimated.
898173_15_ITEM7_P80_S3	See Note 9 "Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's compensation plans.
898173_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
898173_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.
898173_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies.
898173_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance.
898173_15_ITEM7_P82_S3	Letters of credit totaling $48 million and $52 million were outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
898173_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
898173_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	See "Contractual Obligations" and Note 10 "Commitments" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our operating leases.
898173_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management.
898173_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
898173_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates.
898173_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP.
898173_15_ITEM7_P84_S4	However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.
898173_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal.
898173_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population.
898173_15_ITEM7_P85_S3	We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand.
898173_15_ITEM7_P85_S4	We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost.
898173_15_ITEM7_P85_S5	This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods.
898173_15_ITEM7_P85_S6	Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances.
898173_15_ITEM7_P85_S7	We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future.
898173_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink.
898173_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories.
898173_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances.
898173_15_ITEM7_P86_S3	We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates.
898173_15_ITEM7_P86_S4	If the shrink reserve changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2014 , the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
898173_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment.
898173_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset.
898173_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	The estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations.
898173_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.
898173_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets.
898173_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment.
898173_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	We have never recorded an impairment to goodwill.
898173_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach.
898173_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value.
898173_15_ITEM7_P91_S4	In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2014 , nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing.
898173_15_ITEM7_P91_S5	If the price of O'Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.
898173_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	Supplier Concessions We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates.
898173_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales.
898173_15_ITEM7_P93_S2	Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns.
898173_15_ITEM7_P93_S3	Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers' financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations.
898173_15_ITEM7_P93_S4	Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations.
898173_15_ITEM7_P93_S5	The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
898173_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	Warranty Reserves We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties.
898173_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers.
898173_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims.
898173_15_ITEM7_P94_S3	For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims.
898173_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales.
898173_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line.
898173_15_ITEM7_P95_S2	Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims.
898173_15_ITEM7_P95_S3	If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2014 , the financial impact would have been approximately $3 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
898173_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits.
898173_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim.
898173_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations.
898173_15_ITEM7_P97_S2	Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities.
898173_15_ITEM7_P97_S3	Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains.
898173_15_ITEM7_P97_S4	As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information.
898173_15_ITEM7_P97_S5	These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate.
898173_15_ITEM7_P97_S6	These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_15_ITEM7_P97_S7	We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities.
898173_15_ITEM7_P97_S8	If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2014 , the financial impact would have been approximately $12 million or 1.0% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
898173_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	Legal Reserves We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O'Reilly is currently involved.
898173_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business.
898173_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	We resolved the governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK") and certain of CSK's former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the 2008 acquisition date.
898173_15_ITEM7_P98_S3	As a result of the acquisition, we incurred legal fees and costs related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations.
898173_15_ITEM7_P98_S4	Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK.
898173_15_ITEM7_P98_S5	Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures.
898173_15_ITEM7_P98_S6	If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2014 , the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
898173_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
898173_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve.
898173_15_ITEM7_P99_S2	We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit.
898173_15_ITEM7_P99_S3	The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings.
898173_15_ITEM7_P99_S4	Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations.
898173_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	In management's opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented.
898173_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates.
898173_15_ITEM7_P100_S2	Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position.
898173_15_ITEM7_P100_S3	While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority.
898173_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	For the last three fiscal years, we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.
898173_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2014 and 2013 .
898173_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown.
898173_15_ITEM7_P103_S2	The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.

898173_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	Under ASU 2014-09, an entity is required to follow a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to recognize when promised goods or services are transferred to customers.
898173_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	ASU 2014-09 offers specific accounting guidance for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.
898173_15_ITEM7_P106_S2	In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
898173_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including periods within that reporting period, and can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment at the date of adoption, with early adoption not permitted.
898173_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2017; we are in the process of evaluating the potential future impact, if any, of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	In August of 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)" ("ASU 2014-15").
898173_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	ASU 2014-15 will require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting period and to provide related footnote disclosure in circumstances in which substantial doubt exists.
898173_15_ITEM7_P108_S2	ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early application permitted.
898173_15_ITEM7_P108_S3	We will apply this guidance beginning with our annual period ending December 31, 2016; the application of this guidance affects disclosure only and, therefore, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") with variable interest rates based on either a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $1.40 billion and $1.40 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
898173_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $1.53 billion and $1.41 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.
898173_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less.
898173_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal.
898173_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $251 million .
898173_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	The management of O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company"), under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Company's Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) or 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
898173_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
898173_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	Internal control over financial reporting includes all policies and procedures that:
898173_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	Management recognizes that all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
898173_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
898173_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk.
898173_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
898173_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 .
898173_15_ITEM8_P5_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013 framework).
898173_15_ITEM8_P5_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2014 , the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
898173_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	Ernst Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has audited the Company's consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein.

898173_15_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
898173_15_ITEM8_P8_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
898173_15_ITEM8_P8_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
898173_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
898173_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
898173_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

898173_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Company's stores carry an extensive product line, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and various automotive accessories.
898173_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company owned and operated 4,366 stores in 43 states, servicing both the do-it-yourself ("DIY") customer and the professional service provider.
898173_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company's robust distribution system provides stores with same-day or overnight access to an extensive inventory of hard-to-find items not typically stocked in the stores of other auto parts retailers.
898173_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Segment reporting: The Company is managed and operated by a single management team reporting to the chief operating decision maker.
898173_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	O'Reilly stores have similar characteristics including the nature of the products and services, the type and class of customers and the methods used to distribute products and provide service to its customers and, as a whole, make up a single operating segment.
898173_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company does not prepare discrete financial information with respect to product lines, types of customers or geographic locations and as such has one reportable segment.
898173_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
898173_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	These reclassifications had no effect on reported totals for assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity, cash flows or net income.
898173_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
898173_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
898173_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
898173_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
898173_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Cash equivalents: Cash equivalents include investments with maturities of 90 days or less on the date of purchase.
898173_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Accounts receivable: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company's customers to make required payments.
898173_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection is reasonably assured: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_15_ITEM8_P32_S2	Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on historical experience and an evaluation of the current composition of accounts receivable.
898173_15_ITEM8_P32_S3	Amounts due to the Company from its Team Members are included as a component of accounts receivable.
898173_15_ITEM8_P32_S4	These amounts consist primarily of purchases of merchandise on Team Member accounts.

898173_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to these receivables are limited because the Company's customer base consists of a large number of small customers, spreading the credit risk across a broad base.
898173_15_ITEM8_P33_S2	The Company also controls this credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and accounts receivable and credit monitoring procedures.
898173_15_ITEM8_P33_S3	Generally, the Company does not require security when credit is granted to customers.
898173_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Credit losses are provided for in the Company's consolidated financial statements and have consistently been within management's expectations.
898173_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Amounts receivable from suppliers: The Company receives concessions from its suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for new stores and warranties, volume purchase rebates and co-operative advertising.
898173_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to the Company's advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_15_ITEM8_P35_S2	All other supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales.
898173_15_ITEM8_P35_S3	Amounts receivable from suppliers also includes amounts due to the Company for changeover merchandise and product returns.
898173_15_ITEM8_P35_S4	The Company regularly reviews supplier receivables for collectability and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectable amounts based on an evaluation of the Company's suppliers' financial positions and corresponding abilities to meet financial obligations.
898173_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	suppliers and the Company did not record a reserve for uncollectable amounts from suppliers in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2014 or 2013 .
898173_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Inventory: Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	Inventory also includes capitalized costs related to procurement, warehousing and distribution centers ("DCs").
898173_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	Cost has been determined using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, which more accurately matches costs with related revenues.
898173_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Over time, as the Company's merchandise inventory purchases have increased, the Company negotiated improved acquisition costs from its suppliers and the corresponding price deflation exhausted the Company's LIFO reserve balance.
898173_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Company's policy is to not write up the value of its inventory in excess of its replacement cost, and accordingly, the Company's merchandise inventory has been effectively recorded at replacement cost since December 31, 2013.
898173_15_ITEM8_P38_S2	The replacement cost of inventory was $2.56 billion and $2.38 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
898173_15_ITEM8_P38_S3	LIFO costs exceeded replacement costs by $61.4 million and $21.6 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

898173_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method generally over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
898173_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated economic life of the assets.
898173_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	The lease term includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception for which failure to execute renewal options would result in a substantial economic penalty to the Company.
898173_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
898173_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	Upon retirement or sale, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
898173_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.

898173_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values, rather than systematically amortizing goodwill against earnings.
898173_15_ITEM8_P45_S2	During 2014 and 2013 , the goodwill impairment test included a quantitative assessment, which compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill.
898173_15_ITEM8_P45_S3	The Company operates as a single reporting unit, and the Company determined that its fair value exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 ; as such, no goodwill impairment adjustment was required as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
898173_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	Finite-lived intangibles are carried at cost.
898173_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method, generally over the estimated useful lives of the intangibles.
898173_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	Impairment of long-lived assets: The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
898173_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	When such an event occurs, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the asset (asset group) with the carrying amounts of the asset.
898173_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
898173_15_ITEM8_P47_S3	The Company has not historically recorded any material impairment to its long-lived assets and the Company did not record an impairment to its long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2014 or 2013 .
898173_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Valuation of investments: The Company has an unsecured obligation to pay, in the future, the value of deferred compensation and a Company match relating to employee participation in the Company s nonqualified deferred compensation plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") (see Note 9).
898173_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	The future obligation is adjusted to reflect the performance, whether positive or negative, of selected investment measurement options, chosen by each participant.
898173_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company invests in various marketable securities with the intention of selling these securities to fulfill its future obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

898173_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, the Company obtains third-party insurance coverage to limit its exposure.
898173_15_ITEM8_P50_S2	The Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_15_ITEM8_P50_S3	Certain of these liabilities were recorded at an estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate.
898173_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	The following table identifies the components of the Company's self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
898173_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	The current portion of the Company's discounted self-insurance reserves totaled $64.9 million and $57.7 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

898173_15_ITEM8_P53_S3	For this merchandise, when sold, the Company bears the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims.
898173_15_ITEM8_P53_S4	Differences between supplier allowances received by the Company in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales.
898173_15_ITEM8_P53_S5	Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line.
898173_15_ITEM8_P53_S6	The Company's historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims to the Company has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims.
898173_15_ITEM8_P53_S7	See Note 7 for further information concerning the Company's aggregate product warranty liability.
898173_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	Litigation reserves: O'Reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company's business.

898173_15_ITEM8_P54_S2	The Company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred on pending litigation matters.
898173_15_ITEM8_P54_S3	Although the Company cannot ascertain the total amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, the Company does not currently believe that in the aggregate, taking into account applicable insurance coverage, these matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	In addition, O'Reilly was involved in resolving legacy governmental investigations and litigation commenced by the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") against CSK Automotive Corporation ("CSK") and certain former CSK employees arising out of alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the Company's acquisition of CSK in 2008; as a result, O'Reilly incurred legal fees and costs related to potential indemnification obligations.

898173_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	Income taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.
898173_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the GAAP basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rules and rates currently scheduled to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.

898173_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	The estimates of the Company's potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the Company's various tax positions and actual results could differ from estimates.
898173_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal period.
898173_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus, the common stock equivalents associated with the potential impact of dilutive stock options.
898173_15_ITEM8_P74_S2	Certain common stock equivalents that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future were not included in the fully diluted computation because they would have been antidilutive.
898173_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Generally, stock options are antidilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation when the exercise price exceeds the market price of the common shares.
898173_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	See Note 14 for further information concerning these common stock equivalents.

898173_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.
898173_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
898173_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
898173_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: The carrying amount of the Company's marketable securities is included in "Other assets, net" on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014 (see Note 9).

898173_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	Non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: Certain long-lived non-financial assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in certain circumstances, including when there is evidence of impairment.
898173_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	These non-financial assets and liabilities may include assets acquired in a business combination or property and equipment that are determined to be impaired.
898173_15_ITEM8_P85_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company did not have any non-financial assets or liabilities that had been measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition.

898173_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	The table below identifies the estimated fair value of the Company's senior notes, using the market approach.
898173_15_ITEM8_P87_S1	The fair values of the Company's senior notes as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , were determined by reference to quoted market prices of the same or similar instruments (Level 2):
898173_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets include other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, amounts receivable from suppliers and accounts payable.
898173_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	Due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments, the Company believes that the carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair values.
898173_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following table identifies the types of property and equipment included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except useful lives):

898173_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	The business was founded in 1957 by Charles F. O'Reilly and his son, Charles H. ''Chub'' O'Reilly, Sr., and initially operated from a single store in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our common stock has traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "ORLY" since April 22, 1993.
898173_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	At December 31, 2015 , we operated 4,571 stores in 44 states.
898173_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	accessories, such as floor mats, seat covers and truck accessories.
898173_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	See the "Risk Factors" section of Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks relevant to our business.
898173_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	These risk factors include, among others, deteriorating economic conditions, competition in the automotive aftermarket business, our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, future growth assurance, our dependence upon key and other personnel, our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products, our acquisition strategies, complications in our distribution centers ("DCs"), failure to achieve high levels of service and product quality, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, our increased debt levels, a downgrade in our credit ratings, data security, and environmental legislation and other regulations.
898173_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy.
898173_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O'Reilly values, including superior customer service and expense control.
898173_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve, by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	We believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages, which cannot be easily duplicated.
898173_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Proven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy:
898173_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	For more than 35 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage.
898173_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of consumers of automotive aftermarket parts, capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors, and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service providers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	In 2015 , we derived approximately 58% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 42% of our sales from our professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	Historically, we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation.
898173_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business, due to our systems, knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, supported by our approximately 700 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer.
898173_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets.
898173_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Superior Customer Service: We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products.
898173_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	We believe that the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the specific automotive products needed to complete their repairs.
898173_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	Accordingly, each O'Reilly store carries, or has same or next day availability to, a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications.
898173_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management's assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.
898173_16_ITEM1_P9_S4	We have no material backorders for the products we sell.
898173_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	We seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and to retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below:
898173_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	a robust point-of-sale system integrated with our proprietary electronic catalog, which contains a wide variety of product images, schematics and technical specifications, equips our Team Members with highly effective tools to source products in our extensive supply network.
898173_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Technically Proficient Professional Parts People: Our highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators.
898173_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard part repairs, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis.
898173_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People.
898173_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	We believe our commitment to a robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network.
898173_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our strategic, regional, tiered distribution network includes DCs and Hub stores.
898173_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management.
898173_16_ITEM1_P13_S3	We currently operate 26 regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 146,000 stock keeping units ("SKUs"), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P13_S4	To augment our robust DC network, we operate 297 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to an average of 44,000 SKUs to other stores within the surrounding area.
898173_16_ITEM1_P13_S5	We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.
898173_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Experienced Management Team: Our Company philosophy is to "promote from within" and the vast majority of our senior management, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company.
898173_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience.
898173_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	We have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 174 professionals who average 18 years of service; 236 corporate managers who average 16 years of service; and 444 district managers who average 12 years of service.
898173_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	Our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 23 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993.
898173_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	Aggressively Open New Stores: We intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket.
898173_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	During 2015 , we opened 205 net, new stores and we plan to open approximately 210 net, new stores in 2016 , which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets.
898173_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O'Reilly stores.
898173_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	We typically open new stores by (i) constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory; (ii) acquiring an independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store; or (iii) purchasing multi-store chains.
898173_16_ITEM1_P15_S4	New store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_16_ITEM1_P15_S5	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities, competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius, and the number of competitors.
898173_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network.
898173_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets.
898173_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.
898173_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Grow Sales in Existing Stores: Profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy.
898173_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O'Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability.
898173_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions: The automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, such as ourselves, to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation.
898173_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets.
898173_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Continually Enhance Store Design and Location: Our current prototype store design features optimized square footage, high ceilings, convenient interior store layouts, improved in-store signage, bright lighting, convenient ingress and egress and parking, and dedicated counters to serve professional service providers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance overall customer service.
898173_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance.
898173_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	2015 , we relocated 24 stores and renovated 41 stores.
898173_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best serve our customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Continually Enhance the Growth and Functionality of Our E-Commerce Website: Our user-friendly website, www.oreillyauto.com , allows our customers to search product and repair content, check the in-store availability of our products, and place orders for either home delivery or in-store pickup.
898173_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	We continue to enhance the functionality of our website to provide our customers with a friendly and convenient shopping experience, as well as a robust product and repair content information resource, which will continue to build the O'Reilly Brand.
898173_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	As of January 31, 2016 , we employed 71,943 Team Members ( 37,879 full-time Team Members and 34,064 part-time Team Members), of whom 61,411 were employed at our stores, 7,612 were employed at our DCs and 2,920 were employed at our corporate and regional offices.
898173_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	A union represents 50 stores ( 538 Team Members) in the Greater Bay Area in California and has for many years.
898173_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	In addition, approximately 108 Team Members who drive over-the-road trucks in three of our DCs are represented by a labor union.
898173_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	Except for these Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions.
898173_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	Our tradition for 59 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our "Live Green" culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member's contribution to the success of O'Reilly.
898173_16_ITEM1_P24_S4	This focus on professionalism and respect has created an industry-leading team, and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent.
898173_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	the type and size of store that should be developed.
898173_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale.
898173_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas.
898173_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	As these store clusters mature, we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas.
898173_16_ITEM1_P27_S3	This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.
898173_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Store Locations and Size: As a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our stores, on average, carry approximately 23,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,200 total square feet in size.
898173_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	At December 31, 2015 , we had a total of approximately 33 million square feet in our 4,571 stores.
898173_16_ITEM1_P28_S3	Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 146,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 297 Hub stores, which, on average, carry approximately 44,000 SKUs and average approximately 10,000 square feet in size.
898173_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	We believe that our stores are ''destination stores'' generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity.
898173_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	The following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 :
898173_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	Store Layout: We utilize a computer-assisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent front room retail merchandise presentation and customize our hard-parts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area.
898173_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	Front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access, maximum selling space and to prominently display high-turnover products and accessories to customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	To ensure the best customer experience possible, we have selectively implemented bilingual, in-store signage based on the demographics in each store's geographic area.
898173_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Aisle displays and end caps are used to feature high-demand, seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.
898173_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Store Automation: To enhance store-level operations, customer service and reliability, we use Linux servers and IBM I-Series computer systems in our stores.
898173_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	These systems are linked with the I-Series computers located in each of our DCs.
898173_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our point-of-sale system provides immediate access to our electronic catalog, part images and schematics and pricing information by make, model and year of vehicle.
898173_16_ITEM1_P33_S3	This system speeds transaction times, reduces the customer's checkout time, ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service.
898173_16_ITEM1_P33_S4	Moreover, our store automation systems capture detailed sales information, which assists in store management, strategic planning, inventory control and distribution efficiency.
898173_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store.
898173_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	Each of our 444 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten stores, which provides our stores with a strong operational support.
898173_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model.
898173_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	Store and district managers also receive continuous training through online assignments, field workshops, regional meetings and our annual managers' conference.
898173_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through incentive compensation programs.
898173_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	Under our incentive compensation programs, base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability.
898173_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	In addition, each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs, and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store's performance.
898173_16_ITEM1_P36_S3	We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store Team Members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.
898173_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	We believe our highly trained team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	A significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers; therefore, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products.
898173_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from Professional Parts People, particularly when purchasing hard parts.
898173_16_ITEM1_P37_S3	The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.
898173_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	We screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs, or automotive aptitude.
898173_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company, as well as the requirements for their specific job position.
898173_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P38_S3	Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O'Reilly Certified Parts Professional test.
898173_16_ITEM1_P38_S4	Passing the O'Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE).
898173_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	All of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager.
898173_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	Afterward, these Team Members spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P39_S3	Additionally, each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.
898173_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	We believe that our tiered distribution model provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions, while lowering our inventory carrying costs by controlling the depth of our inventory.
898173_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Moreover, we believe our ongoing, significant capital investments made in our DC network allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network.
898173_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	Our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each DC.
898173_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Distribution Centers: As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 26 DCs comprised of approximately 10.0 million operating square feet (see the "Properties" table in Item 2 of this Form 10-K for a detailed listing of DC operating square footages).
898173_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	Our DCs stock an average of 146,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional DCs' on-hand inventory.
898173_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to all of our stores in the continental United States.
898173_16_ITEM1_P41_S3	In addition, stores within an individual DC's metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC's "city counter," most of which receive this service seven days per week.
898173_16_ITEM1_P41_S4	Our DCs also provide weekend service not only to stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute products to surrounding stores.
898173_16_ITEM1_P41_S5	Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores.
898173_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	enhance our distribution network by adding one additional new DC in Texas and expanding one existing DC in North Carolina.
898173_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total growth capacity of over 600 stores in our existing distribution center network.
898173_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	In 2016, we plan to open one additional DC, which will be located in Selma, near San Antonio, Texas.
898173_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	This new DC will have the capacity to service 250 stores and, taking into account this new DC and 210 planned, net, new store openings in 2016, we expect to end the year in 2016 with a total growth capacity in our distribution network of over 600 stores.
898173_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Hub stores: We currently operate 297 strategically located Hub stores.
898173_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis.
898173_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	Our Hub stores average approximately 10,000 square feet and carry an average of 44,000 SKUs.
898173_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks.
898173_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products, such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, BWD, Cardone, Castrol, Gates Rubber, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Quaker State, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix, and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products, which span the entire good, better and best value spectrum, under our BestTest , BrakeBest , Import Direct , Master Pro , Micro-Gard , Murray , Omnispark , O'Reilly Auto Parts , Precision , Power Torque , Super Start , and Ultima brands.
898173_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	Our proprietary private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers, meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary bands, which we have acquired or developed over time.
898173_16_ITEM1_P45_S3	Our "good" house brands provide a great combination of quality and value, a characteristic important to our DIY customers, while our proprietary national brands offer "better" and "best" options for our more heavy-duty DIY customers, as well as our professional service provider customers, who require high quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses.
898173_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	We have no long-term contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts.
898173_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs, for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell.
898173_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	We have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases.
898173_16_ITEM1_P46_S4	As a whole, we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good.
898173_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 900 suppliers, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 22% of our total purchases in 2015 .
898173_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our largest supplier in 2015 accounted for approximately 6% of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3% to 5% of our total purchases.
898173_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Marketing to the DIY Customer: We use an integrated marketing program, which includes radio, direct mail and newspaper distribution, in-store, online, and social media promotions, and sports and event sponsorships, to aggressively attract DIY customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	The marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the O'Reilly Brand across our geographic footprint.
898173_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	We utilize a combination of brand, product and price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases, which frequently coincide with key sales events.
898173_16_ITEM1_P48_S3	We also utilize a problem-resolution communication strategy, which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles, protecting their long-term automotive investment and establishing O'Reilly as their partner for auto parts needs.
898173_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	To stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts, who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public, we sponsored multiple nationally-televised races and over 1,300 grassroots, local and regional motorsports events throughout 43 states during 2015 .
898173_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	National series events and one National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) race.
898173_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	During the fall and winter months, we strategically sponsor National Collegiate Athletic Association ("NCAA") basketball.
898173_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our relationships with over 30 NCAA teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently displayed O'Reilly logos on TV-visible signs throughout the season.
898173_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	We target Spanish speaking auto parts customers through marketing efforts that include the use of Spanish language radio, print, and outdoor advertising, as well as sponsorships of over 45 local and regional festivals and events.
898173_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	As consumers increasingly turn to the Internet for information and offers, we continue to invest in digital channels to expand the O'Reilly brand presence online and through mobile devices.
898173_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	Search engine optimization strategies are used to drive traffic to our website, and popular social media platforms are used to provide excellent customer service through interaction and dialogue with our customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	To show appreciation for our DIY customers for their continued business, we maintain our O'Reilly O'Rewards customer loyalty program.
898173_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	The program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points toward coupons, which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores.
898173_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	The programs allow us to reward our customers for their continued business, as well as enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business with targeted promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns.
898173_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	Marketing to the Professional Service Provider Customer: We have approximately 700 full-time O'Reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our First Call program.
898173_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	Each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon, selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	Targeted marketing materials such as flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers, paint and body shops and fleet customers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	Our industry-leading First Call program enables our sales representatives, district managers, and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider accounts by providing the products and services identified below:
898173_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Certified Auto Repair Center Program, a program that provides professional service providers with business tools they can utilize to profitably grow and market their shops.
898173_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Marketing to the Independently Owned Parts Store: We also sell automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores ("jobber stores") in certain market areas.
898173_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	These jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an O'Reilly store.
898173_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	We administer a proprietary, dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores called Parts City Auto Parts that currently provides automotive products to approximately 190 jobber stores, with total annual sales of approximately $60 million .
898173_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	As a participant in this program, a jobber store, which meets certain financial and operational standards, is permitted to indicate its Parts City Auto Parts membership through the display of a trademarked logo owned by us.
898173_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	In return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from us, we provide computer software for business management, competitive pricing, advertising, marketing and sales assistance to Parts City Auto Parts affiliate stores.
898173_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	We believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business.
898173_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	Product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store.
898173_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Most products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of internal gross margin targets and competitive reviews, with additional savings offered on some items through special promotional pricing and volume discounts.
898173_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	Consistent with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any in-stock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area.
898173_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our stores accept cash, checks, debit and credit cards.
898173_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	We also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our pre-established credit requirements.
898173_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	Some of the factors considered in our pre-established credit requirements include customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	No customer accounted for greater than one percent of our consolidated net sales, nor do we have any dependence on any single customer.
898173_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	We accept product returns for new products, core products and warranty/defective products.
898173_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	The automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale.
898173_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	The total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $256 billion , according to The Auto Care Association.
898173_16_ITEM1_P62_S2	This market is made up of four segments: labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales and tire sales.
898173_16_ITEM1_P62_S3	O'Reilly's addressable market within this industry is approximately $146 billion , which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and DIY sales.
898173_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations.
898173_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	The sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition and price.
898173_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market.
898173_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts, maintenance items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.).
898173_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout and convenient and accessible store locations.
898173_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our dual market strategy requires significant capital, such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.
898173_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	We have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	To the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
898173_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	To some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	Store sales, profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	We are subject to federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, including those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.
898173_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our oil and battery recycling programs.
898173_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party suppliers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our Team Members, deposited into supplier-provided containers and pallets, and then disposed of by the third-party suppliers.
898173_16_ITEM1_P71_S3	In general, our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the supplier.
898173_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date.
898173_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	However, we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.

898173_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Many of these factors are outside of our control.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our customers' purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the U.S., the total number of registered vehicles in the U.S., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the U.S.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Furthermore, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Both the do-it-yourself ("DIY") and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P5_S5	For a list of our principal competitors, see the "Competition" section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions, and natural disasters.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to DIY customers.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers' automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In addition, our stores and distribution centers ("DCs") located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We cannot assure future growth will be achieved.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2016 and beyond will be achieved.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	For a discussion of our growth strategies, see the "Growth Strategy" section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our business, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P8_S6	We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient, and as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P8_S7	For a discussion of our management, see the "Business" section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	A change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers' ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	For example, financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition, the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers, as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries, may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to, or difficulties in the, manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following:
898173_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our management's attention may be distracted.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other benefits.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may fail, or be unable to, discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, the subsequent owner or operator, may be liable.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, operability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters, or the threat of them, may result in the closure of one or more of our DCs or other facilities, or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	This may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or other catastrophic events.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We believe our Company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Brand value is based, in large part, on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or Team Members.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our stock price would likely suffer.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts' expectations and failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	expose us to fluctuations in interest rates.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In addition, the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes, as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	These ratings are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	A downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our credit facility.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	A downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our notes, preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P29_S5	In addition, a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business, adversely affecting our cash flows.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	A breach of customer, Team Member or Company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and Team Members.
898173_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action.

898173_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States.
898173_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment.
898173_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer.
898173_16_ITEM7_P5_S3	For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects "good," "better," and "best" alternatives.
898173_16_ITEM7_P5_S4	Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the "best" quality category of products.
898173_16_ITEM7_P5_S5	Consumers' willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry.
898173_16_ITEM7_P5_S6	Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops.
898173_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 4,571 stores in 44 states.
898173_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits, and competition.
898173_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers' changing preferences and we also have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as "purchasing up" on the value spectrum.
898173_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.
898173_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Number of Miles Driven The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.
898173_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	According to the Department of Transportation, prior to 2007, the annual number of total miles driven in the U.S. had steadily increased; however, between 2008 and 2013, as the U.S. experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions and historically high levels of unemployment, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. remained relatively flat.
898173_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	In 2014, as the U.S. economy began to recover, miles driven also improved increasing 1.7% , and for 2015, miles driven increased 3.5% .
898173_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and continued demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.
898173_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	We believe that as total employment continues to improve, total miles driven in the U.S. should continue to increase in line with the historical trend of long-term annual growth.
898173_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 6% from 2004 to 2014, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 253 million by the end of 2014.
898173_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicles sales in the U.S. ("SAAR") was approximately 17.2 million , contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road.
898173_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	In the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.6% to 5.7% annually.
898173_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 21% , from 9.4 years in 2004 to 11.4 years in 2014.
898173_16_ITEM7_P10_S5	We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer's willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles.
898173_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty.
898173_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles.
898173_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Unemployment Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending.
898173_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Long-term trends of high unemployment have historically impeded the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the U.S. unemployment rate was 5.6%, and as of December 31, 2015 , the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 5.0% , its lowest rate in over seven years.
898173_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	Aided by the anticipated increase in commuter miles, we believe overall annual U.S. miles driven should continue to increase in line with the historical trend of long-term annual growth, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O'Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.

898173_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 , was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both our DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, and this improvement was without the benefit of an increase in the selling price of like kind items.
898173_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	These better engineered vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time, which does create pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are required, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater.
898173_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Despite pressure from these better engineered vehicles requiring less frequent repairs, customer transaction counts increased for both our DIY and professional service provider customers for the year ended December 31, 2015.
898173_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	These increases in transaction counts were driven by an increase in miles driven and a corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance, which was led by lower gas prices and decreasing unemployment levels.
898173_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	These factors created a positive macroeconomic environment, which was beneficial to both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts.
898173_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	In addition, the increase in our DIY transaction counts benefited from our continued focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, including nights and weekends, and the increase in our professional service provider customer transaction counts benefited from the continued growth of our less mature stores.
898173_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	We opened 205 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to 200 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
898173_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 4,571 stores in 44 states compared to 4,366 stores in 43 states at December 31, 2014 .
898173_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	We anticipate total new store growth to increase to 210 net, new store openings in 2016 .
898173_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 , increased to $4.16 billion (or 52.3% of sales) from $3.71 billion (or 51.4% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 12% .
898173_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores.
898173_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, a smaller non-cash negative last-in, last-out ("LIFO") impact and distribution system efficiencies.
898173_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale.
898173_16_ITEM7_P26_S4	The non-cash negative LIFO impact is the result of our continued product acquisition cost reductions, and due to these acquisition cost reductions, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve in 2013.
898173_16_ITEM7_P26_S5	Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost.
898173_16_ITEM7_P26_S6	During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $28 million and $41 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost.
898173_16_ITEM7_P26_S7	Distribution system efficiencies are the result of leverage on our increased sales volumes and lower fuel costs.
898173_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") for the year ended December 31, 2015 , increased to $2.65 billion (or 33.2% of sales) from $2.44 billion (or 33.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9% .
898173_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and a $19 million litigation loss charge from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider.
898173_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.
898173_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 , increased to $1.51 billion (or 19.0% of sales) from $1.27 billion (or 17.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 19% .
898173_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 , increased to $54 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $48 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 11% .
898173_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 , was primarily the result of a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest in the current period, as compared to the same period in the prior year.
898173_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 , increased to $529 million ( 36.2% effective tax rate) from $444 million ( 36.3% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 19% .
898173_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the result of higher taxable income in 2015, driven by our strong operating results.
898173_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to the non-typical favorable tax reserve adjustment, which was related to historical tax positions due to a previous acquisition, partially offset by a decreased benefit in the current period from the realization of employment tax credits.
898173_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 , increased to $931 million (or 11.7% of sales), from $778 million (or 10.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 20% .
898173_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2015 , increased 25% to $9.17 on 102 million shares from $7.34 on 106 million shares for the same period one year ago.
898173_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased $567 million to $7.22 billion from $6.65 billion for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 9%.
898173_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 6.0% and 4.3% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
898173_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members.
898173_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 (in millions):
898173_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2014, Compared to the Same Period in 2013 Store sales:
898173_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Sales in 2013 for stores that have closed (4 ) Non-store sales:
898173_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2014, was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	The improvements in average ticket values were the result of the continued growth of the more costly, hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales.
898173_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	The overall growth in our hard part categories continues to be driven by our faster growing professional service provider sales, which are primarily comprised of hard part categories and by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles.
898173_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the replacement parts is, on average, greater.
898173_16_ITEM7_P38_S4	While the less frequent repairs required by these better engineered and manufactured vehicles does create pressure on transaction counts, both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts were positive for the year ended December 31, 2014.
898173_16_ITEM7_P38_S5	The increases in professional service provider customer transaction counts were primarily driven by our acquired markets and the continued growth of less mature stores.
898173_16_ITEM7_P38_S6	The increases in DIY transaction counts were driven by our ongoing focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, including nights and weekends.
898173_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	We opened 200 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 190 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2013.
898173_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we operated 4,366 stores in 43 states compared to 4,166 stores in 42 states at December 31, 2013.
898173_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $3.71 billion (or 51.4% of sales) from $3.37 billion (or 50.7% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 10%.
898173_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores.
898173_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, partially offset by the LIFO negative impact resulting from continued product acquisition cost reductions.
898173_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs.
898173_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	During the third quarter of 2013, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve due to acquisition cost improvements we realized over time.
898173_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost.
898173_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $41 million and $22 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost.
898173_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: SG A for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $2.44 billion (or 33.8% of sales) from $2.27 billion (or 34.1% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 8%.
898173_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count.
898173_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.
898173_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $1.27 billion (or 17.6% of sales) from $1.10 billion (or 16.6% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 15%.

898173_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings.
898173_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $444 million (36.3% effective tax rate) from $389 million (36.7% effective tax rate) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 14%.
898173_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014, was the result of higher taxable income in 2014, driven by our strong operating results.
898173_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to increased benefits from the realization of employment tax credits in 2014.
898173_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $778 million (or 10.8% of sales), from $670 million (or 10.1% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 16%.

898173_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program.
898173_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
898173_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations.
898173_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	Additionally, decreased demand or changes in customer buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
898173_16_ITEM7_P48_S4	We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
898173_16_ITEM7_P48_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels.
898173_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):
898173_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	(1) Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company's adoption of new accounting standards during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015.
898173_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
898173_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	(2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.
898173_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	(3) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.
898173_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Current liabilities increased 8% from 2014 to 2015 .
898173_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable, resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings supported in part by our suppliers and additional supplier participation in our enhanced supplier financing program during the year, which allowed us to obtain more favorable payment terms.
898173_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 99.1% as of December 31, 2015 , as compared to 94.6% in the prior year.
898173_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
898173_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	(1) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period.
898173_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Operating activities: The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a decrease in accrued payroll-related liabilities.
898173_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	The larger increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of higher accrued income taxes payable at the end of 2015, as compared to the end of 2014.
898173_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers.
898173_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced supplier financing programs.
898173_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	Our supplier financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers.
898173_16_ITEM7_P55_S3	The smaller decrease in net inventory investment in 2015 was the result of fewer new suppliers entering our supplier financing programs in 2015, as compared to 2014.
898173_16_ITEM7_P55_S4	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 99.1% and 94.6% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
898173_16_ITEM7_P55_S5	The decrease in accrued payroll-related liabilities during 2015, as compared to the increase in 2014, was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates.
898173_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a greater decrease in net inventory investment and larger increases in net income and accrued payroll-related liabilities in 2014 as compared to 2013.
898173_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	The greater decrease in our net inventory investment was the result of increased supplier participation and support of our supplier financing programs.
898173_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 94.6% and 86.6% as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
898173_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	The increase in accrued payroll-related liabilities during 2014, as compared to 2013, was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates and timing of payments for employer obligations under certain benefit plans.
898173_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Investing activities: The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures.
898173_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	Total capital expenditures were $414 million and $430 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and the decrease was primarily related to the construction of additional distribution facilities in 2014 to support our ongoing store growth, partially offset by an increase in the number of new store openings in 2015.
898173_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures.
898173_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	Total capital expenditures were $430 million and $396 million in 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and the increase was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased new stores opened in 2014, as compared to 2013, as well as an increase in the number of new store openings in 2014.
898173_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	We opened 205 , 200 , and 190 net, new stores in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
898173_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	We plan to open 210 net, new stores in 2016 .
898173_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	The current costs associated with the opening of a new store, including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million ; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.
898173_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Financing activities: The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2015.
898173_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term senior notes during 2013, partially offset by a smaller impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2014.
898173_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Unsecured revolving credit facility: On January 14, 2011 , we entered into a credit agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of September 9, 2011 , and as further amended by Amendment No. 2 dated as of July 2, 2013 , and further amended by Amendment No. 3 dated as of June 18, 2015 (the "Credit Agreement").
898173_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The Credit Agreement provides for a $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in July 2018 .
898173_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	The Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings.
898173_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million .
898173_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers' compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amounts of $38 million and $48 million , respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by those amounts.
898173_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Senior Notes: We have issued $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due between January 2021 and June 2023 with United Missouri Bank, N.A. as trustee.
898173_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	Interest on the senior notes, ranging from 3.800% to 4.875% , is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year.
898173_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries ("Subsidiary Guarantors") that incurs or guarantees obligations under our Credit Agreement or under other credit facility or capital markets debt of ours or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors.
898173_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the Subsidiary Guarantor's guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all the property of, the Subsidiary Guarantor.
898173_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by us, and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries.
898173_16_ITEM7_P66_S3	Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries.
898173_16_ITEM7_P66_S4	Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law.
898173_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures.
898173_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.
898173_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.
898173_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50 times, and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times.
898173_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense ("EBITDAR").
898173_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt.
898173_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders.
898173_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.99 times and 5.36 times as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.52 times and 1.72 times as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.
898173_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio range of 2.00 times to 2.25 times.
898173_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):
898173_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	(1) Prior period amount has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company's adoption of new accounting standards during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015.
898173_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
898173_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
898173_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under our Credit Agreement.
898173_16_ITEM7_P72_S3	We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	Share repurchase program: In January of 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program.
898173_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_16_ITEM7_P74_S2	Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_16_ITEM7_P74_S3	As announced on February 4, 2015, May 29, 2015, and February 10, 2016, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $500 million , $500 million and $750 million , respectively, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $6.25 billion .
898173_16_ITEM7_P74_S4	Each additional authorization is effective for a three -year period, beginning on its respective announcement date.
898173_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data):
898173_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we had $143 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
898173_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 26, 2016 , we repurchased an additional 0.8 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $247.61 , for a total investment of $202 million .
898173_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	We have repurchased a total of 52 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 26, 2016 , at an average price of $106.76 for a total aggregate investment of $5.56 billion .
898173_16_ITEM7_P76_S3	As of February 26, 2016 , we had approximately $692 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
898173_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 , included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 "Leasing," Note 9 "Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans" and Note 10 "Commitments" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment's cancellation terms.
898173_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2016 , which are included in "Current liabilities" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
898173_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 12 "Income Taxes" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined.
898173_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	We record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is fully disclosed in Note 9 "Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	This estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined.
898173_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	The following table identifies the estimated payments of the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):
898173_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	(1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $600 million and matures in July 2018 , bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.875% to 1.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor's Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.
898173_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above.
898173_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.125% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor's Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.
898173_16_ITEM7_P82_S3	Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans was 0.000% , our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans was 0.875% and our facility fee was 0.125% .
898173_16_ITEM7_P82_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_16_ITEM7_P82_S5	(2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year.
898173_16_ITEM7_P82_S6	These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments.
898173_16_ITEM7_P82_S7	See Note 6 "Leasing" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.
898173_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits.
898173_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount.
898173_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	See Note 10 "Commitments" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.
898173_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
898173_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.
898173_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers' compensation, general liability and other insurance policies.
898173_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance.
898173_16_ITEM7_P86_S3	Letters of credit totaling $38 million and $48 million were outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
898173_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
898173_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	See "Contractual Obligations" section of Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K and Note 6 "Leasing" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.
898173_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management.
898173_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
898173_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates.
898173_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP.
898173_16_ITEM7_P88_S4	However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.
898173_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink: Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal.
898173_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population.
898173_16_ITEM7_P89_S3	We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand.
898173_16_ITEM7_P89_S4	We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost.
898173_16_ITEM7_P89_S5	This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods.
898173_16_ITEM7_P89_S6	Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances.
898173_16_ITEM7_P89_S7	We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future.
898173_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink.
898173_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories.
898173_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances.
898173_16_ITEM7_P90_S3	We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates.
898173_16_ITEM7_P90_S4	If the shrink reserve changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2015 , the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
898173_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill:
898173_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment.
898173_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset.
898173_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	The estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations.
898173_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.
898173_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets.
898173_16_ITEM7_P95_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment.
898173_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	We have never recorded an impairment to goodwill.
898173_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach.
898173_16_ITEM7_P96_S3	Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value.
898173_16_ITEM7_P96_S4	In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2015 , nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing.
898173_16_ITEM7_P96_S5	If the price of O'Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.
898173_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Supplier Concessions: We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates.
898173_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales.
898173_16_ITEM7_P98_S2	Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns.
898173_16_ITEM7_P98_S3	Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers' financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations.
898173_16_ITEM7_P98_S4	Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations.
898173_16_ITEM7_P98_S5	The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
898173_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	Warranty Reserves: We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties.
898173_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers.
898173_16_ITEM7_P99_S2	Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims.
898173_16_ITEM7_P99_S3	For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims.
898173_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	Differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales.
898173_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line.
898173_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims.
898173_16_ITEM7_P100_S3	If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2015 , the financial impact would have been approximately $4 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
898173_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	Self-Insurance Reserves: We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits.
898173_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim.
898173_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations.
898173_16_ITEM7_P102_S2	Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities.
898173_16_ITEM7_P102_S3	Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains.
898173_16_ITEM7_P102_S4	As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information.
898173_16_ITEM7_P102_S5	These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate.
898173_16_ITEM7_P102_S6	These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_16_ITEM7_P102_S7	We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities.
898173_16_ITEM7_P102_S8	If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2015 , the financial impact would have been approximately $13 million or 0.9% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
898173_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	Legal Reserves: We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O'Reilly is currently involved.
898173_16_ITEM7_P103_S1	We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business.
898173_16_ITEM7_P103_S2	Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures.
898173_16_ITEM7_P103_S3	If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2015 , the financial impact would have been approximately $5 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
898173_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	Taxes: We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
898173_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve.
898173_16_ITEM7_P104_S2	We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit.
898173_16_ITEM7_P104_S3	The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings.
898173_16_ITEM7_P104_S4	Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations.
898173_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	In management's opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented.
898173_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates.
898173_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position.
898173_16_ITEM7_P105_S3	While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results, except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority.
898173_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	For the last three fiscal years, we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.
898173_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.

898173_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	Segment reporting: The Company is managed and operated by a single management team reporting to the chief operating decision maker.
898173_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	O'Reilly stores have similar characteristics including the nature of the products and services, the type and class of customers and the methods used to distribute products and provide service to its customers and, as a whole, make up a single operating segment.

898173_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	These reclassifications had an effect on previously reported totals for assets and liabilities but had no effect on reported totals for shareholders' equity, cash flows or net income.
898173_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
898173_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
898173_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

898173_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Cash equivalents: Cash equivalents include investments with maturities of 90 days or less on the date of purchase.
898173_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Accounts receivable: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company's customers to make required payments.
898173_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection is reasonably assured: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on historical experience and an evaluation of the current composition of accounts receivable.
898173_16_ITEM8_P31_S3	Amounts due to the Company from its Team Members are included as a component of accounts receivable.
898173_16_ITEM8_P31_S4	These amounts consist primarily of purchases of merchandise on Team Member accounts.

898173_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to these receivables are limited because the Company's customer base consists of a large number of small customers, spreading the credit risk across a broad base.
898173_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	The Company also controls this credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and accounts receivable and credit monitoring procedures.
898173_16_ITEM8_P32_S3	Generally, the Company does not require security when credit is granted to customers.
898173_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Credit losses are provided for in the Company's consolidated financial statements and have consistently been within management's expectations.
898173_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Amounts receivable from suppliers: The Company receives concessions from its suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for new stores and warranties, volume purchase rebates and co-operative advertising.
898173_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to the Company's advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	All other supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales.
898173_16_ITEM8_P34_S3	Amounts receivable from suppliers also includes amounts due to the Company for changeover merchandise and product returns.
898173_16_ITEM8_P34_S4	The Company regularly reviews supplier receivables for collectability and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectable amounts based on an evaluation of the Company's suppliers' financial positions and corresponding abilities to meet financial obligations.
898173_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	suppliers and the Company did not record a reserve for uncollectable amounts from suppliers in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 or 2014 .
898173_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Inventory: Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	Inventory also includes capitalized costs related to procurement, warehousing and distribution centers ("DCs").
898173_16_ITEM8_P36_S2	Cost has been determined using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, which more accurately matches costs with related revenues.
898173_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Over time, as the Company's merchandise inventory purchases have increased, the Company negotiated improved acquisition costs from its suppliers and the corresponding price deflation exhausted the Company's LIFO reserve balance.
898173_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Company's policy is to not write up the value of its inventory in excess of its replacement cost, and accordingly, the Company's merchandise inventory has been effectively recorded at replacement cost since December 31, 2013.

898173_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	See the Risk Factors section of Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks relevant to our business.
898173_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	These risk factors include, among others, deteriorating economic conditions, competition in the automotive aftermarket business, our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, future growth assurance, our dependence upon key and other personnel, our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products, our acquisition strategies, complications in our distribution centers ( DCs ), failure to achieve high levels of service and product quality, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, our increased debt levels, a downgrade in our credit ratings, data security, and environmental legislation and other regulations.
898173_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy.
898173_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O Reilly values, including superior customer service and expense control.

898173_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	We believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages, which cannot be easily duplicated.
898173_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Proven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy:
898173_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	For more than 35 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage.
898173_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers, capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors, and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	In 2016 , we derived approximately 58% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 42% of our sales from our professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	Historically, we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation.
898173_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business, due to our systems, knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, supported by our approximately 750 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer.
898173_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets.
898173_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Superior Customer Service: We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products.
898173_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	We believe that the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the specific automotive products needed to complete their repairs.
898173_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	Accordingly, each O Reilly store carries, or has same or next day availability to, a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications.
898173_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.

898173_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis.
898173_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People.
898173_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	We believe our commitment to a robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network.
898173_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our strategic, regional, tiered distribution network includes DCs and Hub stores.
898173_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management.
898173_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	We currently operate 27 regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 148,000 stock keeping units ( SKUs ), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P16_S4	To augment our robust distribution network, we operate 312 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to an average of 45,000 SKUs to other stores within the surrounding area.
898173_17_ITEM1_P16_S5	We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.
898173_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Experienced Management Team: Our Company philosophy is to promote from within and the vast majority of our senior management, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company.
898173_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience.
898173_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	We have a strong management team comprised of senior management with 185 professionals who average 18 years of service; 242 corporate managers who average 16 years of service; and 474 district managers who average 12 years of service.
898173_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	Our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 24 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993.
898173_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Aggressively Open New Stores: We intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket.
898173_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	During 2016 , we opened 210 net, new stores and acquired 48 Bond Auto Parts stores and we plan to open approximately 190 net, new stores in 2017 , which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets.
898173_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O Reilly stores.
898173_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	We typically open new stores by (i) constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory; (ii) acquiring an independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store; or (iii) purchasing multi-store chains.
898173_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	New store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, vehicles in operation, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius.
898173_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network.
898173_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets.
898173_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.
898173_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Grow Sales in Existing Stores: Profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy.
898173_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability.
898173_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions: The automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, such as ourselves, to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation.
898173_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisition targets that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets.
898173_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Continually Enhance Store Design and Location: Our current prototype store design features optimized square footage, high ceilings, convenient interior store layouts, in-store signage, bright lighting, convenient ingress and egress and parking, and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance overall customer service.
898173_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance.
898173_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	During 2016 , we relocated 20 stores and renovated 30 stores.
898173_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best serve our customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Continually Enhance the Growth and Functionality of Our E-Commerce Website: Our user-friendly website, www.oreillyauto.com , allows our customers to search product and repair content, check the in-store availability of our products, and place orders for either home delivery or in-store pickup.
898173_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	We continue to enhance the functionality of our website to provide our customers with a friendly and convenient shopping experience, as well as a robust product and repair content information resource, which will continue to build the O Reilly Brand.
898173_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	As of January 31, 2017 , we employed 74,715 Team Members ( 42,289 full-time Team Members and 32,426 part-time Team Members), of whom 63,380 were employed at our stores, 7,907 were employed at our DCs and 3,428 were employed at our corporate and regional offices.
898173_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	A union represents 49 stores ( 493 Team Members) in the Greater Bay Area in California and has for many years.
898173_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	In addition, approximately 104 Team Members who drive over-the-road trucks in three of our DCs are represented by labor unions.
898173_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	Except for these Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions.
898173_17_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our tradition for 60 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our Live Green culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member s contribution to the success of O Reilly.
898173_17_ITEM1_P27_S4	This focus on professionalism and respect has created an industry-leading team, and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent.
898173_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	the type and size of store that should be developed.
898173_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale.
898173_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we seek to begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas.
898173_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	As these store clusters mature, we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas.
898173_17_ITEM1_P30_S3	This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.
898173_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	Store Locations and Size: As a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our stores, on average, carry approximately 23,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,300 total square feet in size.
898173_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	At December 31, 2016 , we had a total of approximately 35 million square feet in our 4,829 stores.
898173_17_ITEM1_P31_S3	Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 148,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 312 Hub stores, which, on average, carry approximately 45,000 SKUs and average approximately 10,600 square feet in size.
898173_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	We believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity.
898173_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	The following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
898173_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Store Layout: We utilize a computer-assisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent front room retail merchandise presentation and customize our hard-parts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of a particular market area.
898173_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	Front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access, maximum selling space and to prominently display high-turnover products and accessories to customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	To ensure the best customer experience possible, we have selectively implemented bilingual, in-store signage based on the demographics in each store s geographic area.
898173_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Aisle displays and end caps are used to feature high-demand, seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.
898173_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Store Automation: To enhance store-level operations, customer service and reliability, we use Linux servers and IBM I-Series computer systems in our stores.
898173_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	These systems are linked with the I-Series computers located in each of our DCs.
898173_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	Our point-of-sale system provides immediate access to our electronic catalog, part images and schematics and pricing information by make, model and year of vehicle.
898173_17_ITEM1_P36_S3	This system speeds transaction times, reduces the customer s checkout time, ensures accuracy and provides enhanced customer service.
898173_17_ITEM1_P36_S4	Moreover, our store automation systems capture detailed sales information, which assists in store management, strategic planning, inventory control and distribution efficiency.
898173_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store.
898173_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Each of our 474 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten stores, which provides our stores with a strong operational support.
898173_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model.
898173_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	Store and district managers also receive continuous training through online assignments, field workshops, regional meetings and our annual managers conference.
898173_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through incentive compensation programs.
898173_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	Under our incentive compensation programs, base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability.
898173_17_ITEM1_P39_S2	In addition, each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs, and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store s performance.
898173_17_ITEM1_P39_S3	We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store Team Members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.
898173_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	We believe our highly trained team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	A significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers; therefore, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products.
898173_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from Professional Parts People, particularly when purchasing hard parts.
898173_17_ITEM1_P40_S3	The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.
898173_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	We screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs, or automotive aptitude.
898173_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company, as well as the requirements for their specific job position.
898173_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O Reilly Certified Parts Professional test.
898173_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	Passing the O Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence ( ASE ).
898173_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	All of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager.
898173_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	Afterward, these Team Members spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	Additionally, each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.
898173_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	We believe that our tiered distribution model provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions, while lowering our inventory carrying costs by controlling the depth of our inventory.
898173_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	Moreover, we believe our ongoing, significant capital investments made in our DC network allows us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network.
898173_17_ITEM1_P43_S2	Our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores and additional penetration into existing markets in the regions surrounding each DC.
898173_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	Distribution Centers: As of December 31, 2016 , we operated 27 DCs comprised of approximately 10.6 million operating square feet (see the Properties table in Item 2 of this Form 10-K for a detailed listing of DC operating square footages).
898173_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our DCs stock an average of 148,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional DCs on-hand inventory.
898173_17_ITEM1_P44_S2	Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to all of our stores in the continental United States.
898173_17_ITEM1_P44_S3	In addition, stores within an individual DC s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC s city counter, most of which receive this service seven days per week.
898173_17_ITEM1_P44_S4	Our DCs provide weekend service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute products to surrounding stores.
898173_17_ITEM1_P44_S5	Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores.
898173_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	make proven, return-on-investment based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs, including conveyor systems, picking modules, lift equipment and computer hardware.
898173_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Hub stores: We currently operate 312 strategically located Hub stores.
898173_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis.
898173_17_ITEM1_P46_S2	Our Hub stores average approximately 10,600 square feet and carry an average of 45,000 SKUs.
898173_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks.
898173_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products, such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, BWD, Cardone, Castrol, Gates Rubber, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Quaker State, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix, and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products, which span the entire good, better and best value spectrum, under our BestTest , BrakeBest , Import Direct , Master Pro , Micro-Gard , Murray , Omnispark , O Reilly Auto Parts , Precision , Power Torque , Super Start , and Ultima brands.
898173_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our proprietary private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers, meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary bands, which we have acquired or developed over time.
898173_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	Our good house brands provide a great combination of quality and value, a characteristic important to our DIY customers, while our proprietary national brands offer better and best options for our more heavy-duty DIY customers, as well as our professional service provider customers, who require high quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses.
898173_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	We have no long-term contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts.
898173_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell.
898173_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	We have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases.
898173_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	As a whole, we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good.
898173_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 900 suppliers, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 23% of our total purchases in 2016 .
898173_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our largest supplier in 2016 accounted for approximately 6% of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3% to 5% of our total purchases.
898173_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Marketing to the DIY Customer: We use an integrated marketing program, which includes radio, direct mail and newspaper distribution, in-store, online, and social media promotions, and sports and event sponsorships, to aggressively attract DIY customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	The marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the O Reilly Brand across our geographic footprint.
898173_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	We utilize a combination of brand, product and price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases, which frequently coincide with key sales events.
898173_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	We also utilize a problem-resolution communication strategy, which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles, protecting their long-term automotive investment and establishing O Reilly as their partner for auto parts needs.
898173_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	To stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts, who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public, we sponsored multiple nationally-televised races and over 1,600 grassroots, local and regional motorsports events throughout 45 states during 2016 .
898173_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	During the fall and winter months, we strategically sponsor National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) basketball.
898173_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our relationships with over 30 NCAA teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently displayed O Reilly logos on TV-visible signs throughout the season.
898173_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	We target Spanish speaking auto parts customers through marketing efforts that include the use of Spanish language radio, print, and outdoor advertising, as well as sponsorships of over 45 local and regional festivals and events.
898173_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	As consumers increasingly turn to the Internet for information and offers, we continue to invest in digital channels to expand the O Reilly brand presence online and through mobile devices.
898173_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	Search engine optimization strategies are used to drive traffic to our website, and popular social media platforms are used to provide excellent customer service through interaction and dialogue with our customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	To show appreciation for our DIY customers for their continued business, we maintain our O Reilly O Rewards customer loyalty program.
898173_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	The program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points toward coupons, which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores.
898173_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	The programs allow us to reward our customers for their continued business, as well as enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business with targeted promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns.
898173_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Marketing to the Professional Service Provider Customer: We have approximately 750 full-time O Reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our First Call program.
898173_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	Each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon, selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	Targeted marketing materials such as flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers, paint and body shops and fleet customers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P56_S3	Our industry-leading First Call program enables our sales representatives, district managers, and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider customers by providing the products and services identified below:
898173_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Certified Auto Repair Center Program, a program that provides professional service provider customers with business tools they can utilize to profitably grow and market their shops.
898173_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	Marketing to the Independently Owned Parts Store: We also sell automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores ( jobber stores ) in certain market areas.
898173_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	These jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an O Reilly store.
898173_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	We administer a proprietary, dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores called Parts City Auto Parts that currently provides automotive products to approximately 190 jobber stores, with total annual sales of approximately $62 million .
898173_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	As a participant in this program, a jobber store, which meets certain financial and operational standards, is permitted to indicate its Parts City Auto Parts membership through the display of a trademarked logo owned by us.
898173_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	In return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from us, we provide computer software for business management, competitive pricing, advertising, marketing and sales assistance to Parts City Auto Parts affiliate stores.
898173_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	We believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business.
898173_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store.
898173_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	Most products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of internal gross margin targets and competitive reviews, with additional savings offered on some items through special promotional pricing and volume discounts.
898173_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	Consistent with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any in-stock product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors in the same market area.
898173_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	Our stores accept cash, checks, debit and credit cards.
898173_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	We also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our pre-established credit requirements.
898173_17_ITEM1_P62_S2	Some of the factors considered in our pre-established credit requirements include customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_17_ITEM1_P62_S3	No customer accounted for greater than one percent of our consolidated net sales, nor do we have any dependence on any single customer.
898173_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	We accept product returns for new products, core products and warranty/defective products.
898173_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	The automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale.
898173_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	The total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $268 billion , according to The Auto Care Association.
898173_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	This market is made up of four segments: labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales and tire sales.
898173_17_ITEM1_P64_S3	Reilly s addressable market within this industry is approximately $154 billion , which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and DIY sales.
898173_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations.
898173_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	The sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition and price.
898173_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market.
898173_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	mass merchandisers and online retailers that carry automotive replacement parts, maintenance items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.).
898173_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout and convenient and accessible store locations.
898173_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	Our dual market strategy requires significant capital, such as the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.
898173_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	We have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	To the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
898173_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	To some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	Store sales, profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	We are subject to federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, including those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.
898173_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our oil and battery recycling programs.
898173_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party suppliers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P73_S2	The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our Team Members, deposited into supplier-provided containers and pallets, and then disposed of by the third-party suppliers.
898173_17_ITEM1_P73_S3	In general, our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the supplier.
898173_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date.
898173_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	However, we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.

898173_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others, with which we do business, to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Many of these factors are outside of our control.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Our customers purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	In addition, restrictions on access to telematics, diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P3_S6	If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the U.S., the total number of registered vehicles in the U.S., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the U.S.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Furthermore, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Both the do-it-yourself ( DIY ) and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	For a list of our principal competitors, see the Competition section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions, and natural disasters.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to DIY customers.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In addition, our stores and distribution centers ( DCs ) located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We cannot assure future growth will be achieved.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning, and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2017 and beyond will be achieved.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	For a discussion of our growth strategies, see the Growth Strategy section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our business, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	and, as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	For a discussion of our management, see the Business section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	A change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	For example, financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	In addition, the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers, as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries, may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to, or difficulties in the, manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Changes in U.S. trade policies, practices, tariffs or taxes could affect our ability and our suppliers ability to source product at current volumes and/or prices.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following:
898173_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our management s attention may be distracted.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses.

898173_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may fail, or be unable to, discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we or the subsequent owner or operator may be liable.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, operability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters, or the threat of them, may result in the closure of one or more of our DCs or other facilities, or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	This may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers.

898173_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business.

898173_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Brand value is based, in large part, on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or Team Members.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	If we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our stock price would likely suffer.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations and failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.

898173_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In addition, the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	A downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes, as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	These ratings are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	A downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	A downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our unsecured senior notes, preventing a holder from selling the unsecured senior notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P30_S5	In addition, a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business, adversely affecting our cash flows.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	A breach of customer, Team Member or Company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and Team Members.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

898173_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings, arising out of the ordinary course of our business.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Environmental legislation and regulations, like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change, could adversely impact all industries.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	While it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, by, among other things, increasing fuel prices.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as minimum wage legislation.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	A violation of, or change in, employment legislation and/or regulations could hinder our ability to control costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by Congress and state legislatures, significantly impacts our healthcare cost structure and increases our healthcare-related expenses.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We continue to evaluate potential additional impacts the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate such impacts.
898173_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If we cannot effectively mitigate the potential additional impacts of the healthcare reform legislation, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.

898173_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.
898173_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Number of Miles Driven The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.
898173_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately 3 trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation.
898173_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	According to the Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. increased 2.8% , 3.5% and 1.7% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and we expect to continue to see modest improvements in total miles driven in the U.S., supported by an increasing number of registered vehicles on the road, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 6% from 2005 to 2015, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 258 million by the end of 2015.
898173_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicles sales in the U.S. ( SAAR ) was approximately 18.3 million , contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road.
898173_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	In the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.4% to 5.7% annually.
898173_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 22% , from 9.4 years in 2005 to 11.5 years in 2015.
898173_17_ITEM7_P10_S5	We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles.
898173_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty.
898173_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles.
898173_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Unemployment Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending.
898173_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Long-term trends of high unemployment have historically impeded the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the U.S. unemployment rate was 5.0%, and as of December 31, 2016 , the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 4.7% .
898173_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	We believe, total employment should remain at healthy levels with marginal improvements, and we would expect to see an increase in commuter traffic with a growing work force, further aiding the positive trend of growth of total miles driven in the U.S. and demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.
898173_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:
898173_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Under the Company s share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors in January of 2011, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	As announced on February 10, 2016 , May 27, 2016 , and November 16, 2016 , our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $750 million , resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $7.75 billion .
898173_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	Each additional authorization is effective for a three -year period, beginning on its respective announcement date.
898173_17_ITEM7_P15_S4	As of February 28, 2017 , we had repurchased approximately 58.4 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $7.25 billion under this program.
898173_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	At the close of business on December 1, 2016, we completed an asset purchase of Bond Auto Parts ( Bond ), a large, privately held automotive parts supplier operating 48 stores throughout Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York.
898173_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :
898173_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	(1) Each percentage of sales amount is computed independently and may not compute to presented totals.
898173_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 , increased $626 million to $8.59 billion from $7.97 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8% .
898173_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.8% and 7.5% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
898173_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from Leap Day during the year ended December 31, 2016.
898173_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 (in millions):
898173_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2016, Compared to the Same Period in 2015 Store sales:
898173_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Sales in 2015 for stores that have closed (4 ) Non-store sales:
898173_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, sales from one additional day due to Leap Day for the year ended December 31, 2016, sales from the acquired 48 Bond stores, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 , was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts from both our DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles.
898173_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	These better engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time.
898173_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	This decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values.
898173_17_ITEM7_P24_S4	Customer transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, despite the added pressure from the better engineered, more technically advance vehicles requiring less frequent repairs.
898173_17_ITEM7_P24_S5	The increase in customer transaction counts was supported by an increase in miles driven, and the corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance, lower year-over-year gas prices and decreasing unemployment levels, creating an overall positive macroeconomic environment.
898173_17_ITEM7_P24_S6	The increase in our DIY customer transaction counts benefited from our continued focus on ensuring our stores are staffed with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, such as nights and weekends.
898173_17_ITEM7_P24_S7	The increase in our professional service provider customer transaction counts benefited from the continued growth of our less mature markets and our better parts and service availability.
898173_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	We opened 210 net, new stores and acquired 48 Bond stores during the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared to opening 205 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
898173_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we operated 4,829 stores in 47 states compared to 4,571 stores in 44 states at December 31, 2015 .
898173_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	We anticipate new store growth will be 190 net, new store openings in 2017 , slightly below the 2016 net, new store openings, due to the resources necessary to convert the acquired 48 Bond stores to our systems, inventory selection and d cor packages during 2017.
898173_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 , increased to $4.51 billion (or 52.5% of sales) from $4.16 billion (or 52.3% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8% .
898173_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores, sales from new stores and one additional day due to Leap Day.
898173_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, partially offset by a larger non-cash last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) impact.
898173_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	Product acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale.
898173_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	The non-cash LIFO impact is the result of these continued product acquisition cost reductions, and due to these reductions, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve in 2013.
898173_17_ITEM7_P26_S5	Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost.
898173_17_ITEM7_P26_S6	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $49 million and $28 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost.
898173_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) for the year ended December 31, 2016 , increased to $2.81 billion (or 32.7% of sales) from $2.65 billion (or 33.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 6% .
898173_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and one additional day due to Leap Day.
898173_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on comparable store sales growth and a $19 million litigation loss charge in the prior year, resulting from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider.
898173_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 , increased to $1.70 billion (or 19.8% of sales) from $1.51 billion (or 19.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 12% .
898173_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 , increased to $62 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $54 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 16% .
898173_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 , was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs, partially offset by an increase in the value of our trading securities.
898173_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	For additional information concerning our trading securities, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016 , increased to $600 million ( 36.6% effective tax rate) from $529 million ( 36.2% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13% .
898173_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, was the result of higher taxable income in 2016, primarily driven by our strong operating results, and higher effective tax rates.
898173_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	due to a larger amount of favorable resolutions of historical tax matters in 2015, compared to 2016, and a smaller benefit in 2016 from the realization of employment tax credits.
898173_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 , increased to $1.04 billion (or 12.1% of sales), from $931 million (or 11.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 11% .
898173_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 , increased 17% to $10.73 on 97 million shares from $9.17 on 102 million shares for the same period one year ago.
898173_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased $751 million to $7.97 billion from $7.22 billion for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 10%.
898173_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 7.5% and 6.0% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
898173_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Comparable store sales were calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members.
898173_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 (in millions):
898173_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2015, Compared to the Same Period in 2014 Store sales:
898173_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Sales in 2014 for stores that have closed (6 ) Non-store sales:
898173_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both our DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, and this improvement was without the benefit of an increase in the selling price of like kind items.
898173_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	These better engineered vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time, which does create pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are required, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater.
898173_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	Despite pressure from these better engineered vehicles requiring less frequent repairs, customer transaction counts increased for both our DIY and professional service provider customers for the year ended December 31, 2015.
898173_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	These increases in transaction counts were driven by an increase in miles driven and a corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance, which was led by lower gas prices and decreasing unemployment levels.
898173_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	These factors created a positive macroeconomic environment, which was beneficial to both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts.
898173_17_ITEM7_P39_S6	In addition, the increase in our DIY transaction counts benefited from our continued focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, including nights and weekends, and the increase in our professional service provider customer transaction counts benefited from the continued growth of our less mature stores.
898173_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	We opened 205 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 200 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2014.
898173_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we operated 4,571 stores in 44 states compared to 4,366 stores in 43 states at December 31, 2014.
898173_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $4.16 billion (or 52.3% of sales) from $3.71 billion (or 51.4% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 12%.
898173_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores.
898173_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, a smaller non-cash negative LIFO impact and distribution system efficiencies.
898173_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale.
898173_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	The non-cash negative LIFO impact is the result of our continued product acquisition cost reductions, and due to these acquisition cost reductions, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve in 2013.
898173_17_ITEM7_P41_S5	Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we were effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost.
898173_17_ITEM7_P41_S6	During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $28 million and $41 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost.
898173_17_ITEM7_P41_S7	Distribution system efficiencies are the result of leverage on our increased sales volumes and lower fuel costs.
898173_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: SG A for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $2.65 billion (or 33.2% of sales) from $2.44 billion (or 33.8% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 9%.
898173_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and a $19 million litigation loss charge from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider.
898173_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.
898173_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $1.51 billion (or 19.0% of sales) from $1.27 billion (or 17.6% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 19%.
898173_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $54 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $48 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 11%.
898173_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest in 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014.
898173_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $529 million (36.2% effective tax rate) from $444 million (36.3% effective tax rate) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 19%.
898173_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the result of higher taxable income in 2015, driven by our strong operating results.
898173_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to the non-typical favorable tax reserve adjustment, which was related to historical tax positions due to a previous acquisition, partially offset by a decreased benefit in 2015 from the realization of employment tax credits.
898173_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $931 million (or 11.7% of sales), from $778 million (or 10.8% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 20%.
898173_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased 25% to $9.17 on 102 million shares from $7.34 on 106 million shares for the same period one year prior.
898173_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program.
898173_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
898173_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations.
898173_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	Additionally, decreased demand or changes in customer buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
898173_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
898173_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels.
898173_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):
898173_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.
898173_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	(2) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.
898173_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Current assets increased 8% , current liabilities increased 12% , total debt increased 36% and total equity decreased 17% from 2015 to 2016.
898173_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	The increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory, resulting from the opening of 210 net, new stores and acquiring 48 Bond stores in 2016.
898173_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable, resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings supported in part by our suppliers and additional supplier participation in our supplier financing program during the year.
898173_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 105.7% as of December 31, 2016, as compared to 99.1% in the prior year.
898173_17_ITEM7_P52_S4	The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of $500 million of 3.550% Senior Notes due 2026.
898173_17_ITEM7_P52_S5	The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity, under our share repurchase program, on additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year.
898173_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
898173_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	(1) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period.
898173_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Operating activities: The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable .
898173_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers.
898173_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 105.7% , 99.1% and 94.6% as of December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
898173_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	The larger increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2016 was primarily attributable to incrementally better terms from our suppliers and additional suppliers participating in our supplier financing programs.
898173_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	The decrease from income taxes payable in 2016, compared to the increase in income taxes payable in 2015, was primarily the result of a prepaid income taxes position at the end of 2016, versus an income taxes payable position at the end of 2015.
898173_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a decrease in accrued payroll-related liabilities.
898173_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	The larger increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of higher accrued income taxes payable at the end of 2015, as compared to the end of 2014.
898173_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced supplier financing programs.
898173_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	The smaller decrease in net inventory investment in 2015 was the result of fewer new suppliers entering our supplier financing programs in 2015, as compared to 2014.
898173_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
898173_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	The decrease in accrued payroll-related liabilities during 2015, as compared to the increase in 2014, was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates.
898173_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Investing activities: The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures and other investing activities in 2016.
898173_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	Total capital expenditures were $476 million and $414 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and the increase was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions, closings and construction costs for new stores and our distribution expansion projects during 2016, as compared to 2015.
898173_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	The increase in other investing activities was primarily due to small acquisitions during 2016.
898173_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures.
898173_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Total capital expenditures were $414 million and $430 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and the decrease was primarily related to the construction of additional distribution facilities in 2014 to support our ongoing store growth, partially offset by an increase in the number of new store openings in 2015.
898173_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	We opened 210 , 205 , and 200 net, new stores in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and acquired 48 Bond stores in 2016.
898173_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	We plan to open 190 net, new stores in 2017 .
898173_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	The current costs associated with the opening of a new store, including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million ; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.
898173_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Financing activities: The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during 2016, partially offset by a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2016.
898173_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2015.
898173_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Unsecured revolving credit facility: On January 14, 2011 , we entered into a credit agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of September 9, 2011 , as further amended by Amendment No. 2 dated as of July 2, 2013 , and as further amended by Amendment No. 3 dated as of June 18, 2015 (the Credit Agreement ).
898173_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Credit Agreement provides for a $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in July 2018 .
898173_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	The Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings.
898173_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million .
898173_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amounts of $39 million and $38 million , respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by those amounts.
898173_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Senior Notes: On March 8, 2016 , we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.550% Senior Notes due 2026 ( 3.550% Senior Notes due 2026 ) at a price to the public of 99.832% of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. ( UMB ) as trustee.
898173_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	Interest on the 3.550% Senior Notes due 2026 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, which began with the first interest payment on September 15, 2016, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year.
898173_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	We have issued a cumulative $1.90 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, which are due between January 2021 and March 2026 with UMB as trustee.
898173_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	Interest on the senior notes, ranging from 3.550% to 4.875% , is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year.
898173_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries ( Subsidiary Guarantors ) that incurs or guarantees obligations under our Credit Agreement or under other credit facility or capital markets debt of ours or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors.
898173_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the Subsidiary Guarantor s guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all the property of, the Subsidiary Guarantor.
898173_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by us, and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries.
898173_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law.
898173_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures.
898173_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.
898173_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.
898173_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50 times and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times.
898173_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense ( EBITDAR ).
898173_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense.
898173_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to EBITDAR.
898173_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt.
898173_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders.
898173_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 6.15 times and 5.99 times as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.63 times and 1.52 times as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.
898173_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio range of 2.00 times to 2.25 times.
898173_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):
898173_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
898173_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under our Credit Agreement.
898173_17_ITEM7_P76_S3	We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_17_ITEM7_P76_S4	Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_17_ITEM7_P76_S5	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Share repurchase program: In January of 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program.
898173_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_17_ITEM7_P77_S3	As announced on February 10, 2016 , May 27, 2016 , and November 16, 2016 , our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $750 million , resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $7.75 billion .
898173_17_ITEM7_P77_S4	Each additional authorization is effective for a three -year period, beginning on its respective announcement date.
898173_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data):
898173_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had $888 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
898173_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 28, 2017 , we repurchased an additional 1.4 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $267.32 , for a total investment of $388 million .
898173_17_ITEM7_P79_S2	We have repurchased a total of 58 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 28, 2017 , at an average price of $124.14 for a total aggregate investment of $7.25 billion .
898173_17_ITEM7_P79_S3	As of February 28, 2017 , we had approximately $500 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
898173_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 , included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 Leasing, Note 9 Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans and Note 10 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment s cancellation terms.
898173_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2017 , which are included in Current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
898173_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 12 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined.
898173_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , we recorded a net liability of $41 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of Other liabilities.
898173_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	We record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the Company s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is fully disclosed in Note 9 Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined.
898173_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we recorded a liability of $20 million related to this uncertain liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of Other liabilities.
898173_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	The following table identifies the estimated payments of the Company s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):
898173_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	(1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $600 million and matures in July 2018 , bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.875% to 1.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.
898173_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above.
898173_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.125% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.
898173_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans was 0.000% , our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans was 0.875% and our facility fee was 0.125% .
898173_17_ITEM7_P86_S4	As of December 31, 2016 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_17_ITEM7_P86_S5	(2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year.
898173_17_ITEM7_P86_S6	These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments.
898173_17_ITEM7_P86_S7	See Note 6 Leasing to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.
898173_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits.
898173_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount.
898173_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	See Note 10 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.
898173_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
898173_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.
898173_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies.
898173_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance.
898173_17_ITEM7_P90_S3	Letters of credit totaling $39 million and $38 million were outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
898173_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
898173_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	See Contractual Obligations section of Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K and Note 6 Leasing to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.
898173_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management.
898173_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
898173_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP.
898173_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.
898173_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink: Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal.
898173_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population.
898173_17_ITEM7_P94_S3	We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand.
898173_17_ITEM7_P94_S4	We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost.
898173_17_ITEM7_P94_S5	This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods.
898173_17_ITEM7_P94_S6	Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances.
898173_17_ITEM7_P94_S7	We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future.
898173_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink.
898173_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories.
898173_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances.
898173_17_ITEM7_P95_S3	We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates.
898173_17_ITEM7_P95_S4	If the shrink reserve changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2016 , the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
898173_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill:
898173_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment.
898173_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset.
898173_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	The estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations.
898173_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.
898173_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets.
898173_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment.
898173_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	We have never recorded an impairment to goodwill.
898173_17_ITEM7_P101_S2	The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach.
898173_17_ITEM7_P101_S3	Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value.
898173_17_ITEM7_P101_S4	In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2016 , nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing.
898173_17_ITEM7_P101_S5	If the price of O Reilly s stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.
898173_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Supplier Concessions: We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates.
898173_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales.
898173_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns.
898173_17_ITEM7_P103_S3	Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations.
898173_17_ITEM7_P103_S4	Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations.
898173_17_ITEM7_P103_S5	The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
898173_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Warranty Reserves: We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties.
898173_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers.
898173_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims.
898173_17_ITEM7_P104_S3	For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims.
898173_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	Differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of sales.
898173_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line.
898173_17_ITEM7_P105_S2	Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims.
898173_17_ITEM7_P105_S3	If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2016 , the financial impact would have been approximately $4 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
898173_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	Self-Insurance Reserves: We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits.
898173_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim.
898173_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations.
898173_17_ITEM7_P107_S2	Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date, and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities.
898173_17_ITEM7_P107_S3	Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains.
898173_17_ITEM7_P107_S4	As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information.
898173_17_ITEM7_P107_S5	These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate.
898173_17_ITEM7_P107_S6	These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_17_ITEM7_P107_S7	We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities.
898173_17_ITEM7_P107_S8	If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2016 , the financial impact would have been approximately $13 million or 0.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
898173_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	Legal Reserves: We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation, for which O Reilly is currently involved.
898173_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business.
898173_17_ITEM7_P108_S2	Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures.
898173_17_ITEM7_P108_S3	If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2016 , the financial impact would have been approximately $4 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
898173_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	Taxes: We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
898173_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve.
898173_17_ITEM7_P109_S2	We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit.
898173_17_ITEM7_P109_S3	The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings.
898173_17_ITEM7_P109_S4	Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations.
898173_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented.
898173_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates.
898173_17_ITEM7_P110_S2	Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position.
898173_17_ITEM7_P110_S3	While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results, except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority.
898173_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	For the last three fiscal years, we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.
898173_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	The following tables set forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
898173_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments, which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown (in thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data):
898173_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	(1) Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for each quarter and annual period.
898173_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	The quarterly earnings per share amounts may not sum to equal the full-year earnings per share amount.
898173_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	The unaudited operating data presented above should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.
898173_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	In May of 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ).
898173_17_ITEM7_P117_S1	Under ASU 2014-09, an entity is required to follow a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to recognize when promised goods or services are transferred to customers.
898173_17_ITEM7_P117_S2	ASU 2014-09 offers specific accounting guidance for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.
898173_17_ITEM7_P117_S3	In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
898173_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	In August of 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ), to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.
898173_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	For public companies, ASU 2015-14 changes ASU 2014-09 to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
898173_17_ITEM7_P118_S2	These ASUs can be adopted retrospectively or as a cumulative-effective adjustment at the date of adoption, with early adoption allowed, but not before December 15, 2016.
898173_17_ITEM7_P118_S3	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018.
898173_17_ITEM7_P118_S4	We have established a task force, composed of multiple functional groups inside of the Company, that is currently in the process of evaluating critical components of this new guidance and the potential impact of the guidance on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
898173_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	that are not the responsibility of our suppliers, the application of the Company s retail O Rewards loyalty program and all applicable financial statement disclosures required by the new guidance.
898173_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	At this time, the task force has not completed its evaluation of the impact or means of adoption.
898173_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	In February of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ).
898173_17_ITEM7_P120_S1	Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.
898173_17_ITEM7_P120_S2	ASU 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions.
898173_17_ITEM7_P120_S3	Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
898173_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted.
898173_17_ITEM7_P121_S1	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2019.
898173_17_ITEM7_P121_S2	We have established a task force, composed of multiple functional groups inside of the Company, that is currently in the process of evaluating critical components this new guidance and the potential impact of the guidance on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
898173_17_ITEM7_P121_S3	Based on the preliminary work completed, we are considering the potential implications of the new standard on determining the discount rate to be used in valuing new and existing leases, the treatment of existing favorable and unfavorable lease agreements acquired in connection with previous acquisitions, procedural and operational changes that may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the guidance and all applicable financial statement disclosures required by the guidance, all of which are areas that could potentially be impacted by adoption of the guidance.
898173_17_ITEM7_P121_S4	At this time, the task force has not completed its full evaluation; however, we believe the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on the total assets and total liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheets.
898173_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	In March of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments ( ASU 2016-06 ).
898173_17_ITEM7_P122_S1	ASU 2016-06 clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call or put options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the debt hosts and requires entities to solely use the four-step decision sequence, which is already in existence, when assessing the embedded call or put options.
898173_17_ITEM7_P122_S2	For public companies, ASU 2016-06 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, and can be adopted on a modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted.
898173_17_ITEM7_P122_S3	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2017.
898173_17_ITEM7_P122_S4	The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

898173_17_ITEM7_P123_S1	Under ASU 2016-09, several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows, were simplified.
898173_17_ITEM7_P123_S2	For public companies, ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted.
898173_17_ITEM7_P123_S3	ASU 2016-09 includes various adoption methods, depending on the guidance being adopted; amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements and forfeitures should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method, while the amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows should be applied retrospectively, the amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement should be applied prospectively, and amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively.
898173_17_ITEM7_P123_S4	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2017.
898173_17_ITEM7_P123_S5	We are in the process of evaluating the future impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as well as which method of adoption is most appropriate.
898173_17_ITEM7_P123_S6	At this time, we anticipate the adoption of the new guidance will prospectively impact our reported provision for income taxes, net income, weighted-average common shares outstanding - assuming dilution and earnings per share - assuming dilution, as well as retrospectively and prospectively impact our reported net cash provided by/used in operating activities and net cash provided by/used in financing activities.
898173_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	In June of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13 ).
898173_17_ITEM7_P124_S1	Under ASU 2016-13, businesses and other organizations are required to present financial assets, measured at amortized costs basis, at the net amount expected to be collected.
898173_17_ITEM7_P124_S2	The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis, such as trade receivables.
898173_17_ITEM7_P124_S3	The measurement of expected credit loss will be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount.
898173_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	For public companies, ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted.
898173_17_ITEM7_P125_S1	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2020.
898173_17_ITEM7_P125_S2	The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

898173_17_ITEM7_P128_S1	ASU 2017-04 eliminates the second step in the previous process for goodwill impairment testing; instead the test is now a one-step process that calls for goodwill impairment loss to be measured as the excess of the reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value.
898173_17_ITEM7_P128_S2	For public companies, ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires prospective adoption, with early adoption after January 1, 2017.

898173_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Reilly, refer to O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
898173_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) with variable interest rates based on either a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $1.90 billion and $1.40 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
898173_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $1.98 billion and $1.47 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.
898173_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less.
898173_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal.
898173_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $147 million .
898173_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	The management of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company ), under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) or 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
898173_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
898173_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management recognizes that all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
898173_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
898173_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk.
898173_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
898173_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 .
898173_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework).
898173_17_ITEM8_P4_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2016 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
898173_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	Ernst Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has audited the Company s consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
898173_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have audited O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
898173_17_ITEM8_P6_S1	Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
898173_17_ITEM8_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
898173_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
898173_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
898173_17_ITEM8_P7_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
898173_17_ITEM8_P7_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
898173_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
898173_17_ITEM8_P8_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
898173_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

898173_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Segment reporting: The Company is managed and operated by a single management team reporting to the chief operating decision maker.
898173_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	Reilly stores have similar characteristics, including the nature of the products and services, the type and class of customers and the methods used to distribute products and provide service to its customers and, as a whole, make up a single operating segment.
898173_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company does not prepare discrete financial information with respect to product lines, types of customers or geographic locations and as such has one reportable segment.
898173_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
898173_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
898173_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

898173_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	Cash equivalents: Cash equivalents include investments with maturities of 90 days or less on the date of purchase.
898173_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Accounts receivable: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company s customers to make required payments.
898173_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection is reasonably assured: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on historical experience and an evaluation of the current composition of accounts receivable.
898173_17_ITEM8_P29_S3	Amounts due to the Company from its Team Members are included as a component of accounts receivable.
898173_17_ITEM8_P29_S4	These amounts consist primarily of purchases of merchandise on Team Member accounts.
898173_17_ITEM8_P29_S5	Accounts receivable due from Team Members was approximately $1.2 million and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

898173_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to these receivables are limited because the Company s customer base consists of a large number of small customers, spreading the credit risk across a broad base.
898173_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	The Company also controls this credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and accounts receivable and credit monitoring procedures.
898173_17_ITEM8_P30_S3	Generally, the Company does not require security when credit is granted to customers.

898173_17_ITEM8_P31_S4	The Company regularly reviews supplier receivables for collectability and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectable amounts based on an evaluation of the Company s suppliers financial positions and corresponding abilities to meet financial obligations.
898173_17_ITEM8_P31_S5	Management does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the Company will be unable to collect the amounts receivable from suppliers and the Company did not record a reserve for uncollectable amounts from suppliers in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016 or 2015 .
898173_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Inventory: Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	Inventory also includes capitalized costs related to procurement, warehousing and distribution centers ( DC s).
898173_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	Cost has been determined using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method, which more accurately matches costs with related revenues.
898173_17_ITEM8_P32_S3	Over time, as the Company s merchandise inventory purchases have increased, the Company negotiated improved acquisition costs from its suppliers and the corresponding price deflation exhausted the Company s LIFO reserve balance.
898173_17_ITEM8_P32_S4	The Company s policy is to not write up the value of its inventory in excess of its replacement cost, and accordingly, the Company s merchandise inventory has been effectively recorded at replacement cost since December 31, 2013.

898173_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.
898173_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

898173_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values, rather than systematically amortizing goodwill against earnings.
898173_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	During 2016 and 2015 , the goodwill impairment test included a quantitative assessment, which compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill.
898173_17_ITEM8_P45_S3	The Company operates as a single reporting unit, and the Company determined that its fair value exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 ; as such, no goodwill impairment adjustment was required as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
898173_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Finite-lived intangibles are carried at cost and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method, generally over the estimated useful lives of the intangibles.

898173_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	accessories, such as floor mats, seat covers and truck accessories.
898173_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	used oil, oil filter and battery recycling.
898173_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	See the Risk Factors section of Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks relevant to our business.
898173_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	These risk factors include, among others, deteriorating economic conditions, competition in the automotive aftermarket business, our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions, future growth assurance, our dependence upon key and other personnel, our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products, our acquisition strategies, complications in our distribution centers ( DCs ), failure to achieve high levels of service and product quality, unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, our increased debt levels, a downgrade in our credit ratings, data security, and environmental legislation and other regulations.
898173_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategy.
898173_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O Reilly values, including superior customer service and expense control.
898173_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	Our intent is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve, by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution network and experienced management team make up our key competitive advantages, which cannot be easily duplicated.
898173_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Proven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy:
898173_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	For more than 35 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage.
898173_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers, capitalizing on our existing retail and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer competitors, and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	In 2017 , we derived approximately 58% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 42% of our sales from our professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	Historically, we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation.
898173_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business, due to our systems, knowledge and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, supported by our approximately 780 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer.
898173_18_ITEM1_P11_S3	We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets.
898173_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Superior Customer Service: We seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products.
898173_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the specific automotive products needed to complete their repairs.
898173_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	Accordingly, each O Reilly store carries, or has same or next day availability to, a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications.
898173_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates and management s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.
898173_18_ITEM1_P12_S4	We have no material backorders for the products we sell.
898173_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	We seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below:
898173_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	a robust point-of-sale system integrated with our proprietary electronic catalog, which contains a wide variety of product images, schematics and technical specifications and equips our Team Members with highly effective tools to source products in our extensive supply network.
898173_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Technically Proficient Professional Parts People: Our highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators.
898173_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	service provider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis.
898173_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People.
898173_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	We believe our commitment to a robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network.
898173_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our strategic, regional, tiered distribution network includes DCs and Hub stores.
898173_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management.
898173_18_ITEM1_P17_S3	We currently operate 27 regional DCs, which provide our stores with same-day or overnight access to an average of 157,000 stock keeping units ( SKUs ), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P17_S4	To augment our robust distribution network, we operate 331 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to an average of 48,000 SKUs to other stores within the surrounding area.
898173_18_ITEM1_P17_S5	We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business.
898173_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Experienced Management Team: Our Company philosophy is to promote from within and the vast majority of our senior management, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company.
898173_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience.
898173_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	We have a strong management team comprised of 190 senior managers who average 19 years of service; 244 corporate managers who average 16 years of service; and 496 district managers who average 12 years of service.
898173_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	Our management team has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 25 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993.
898173_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Aggressively Open New Stores: We intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket.
898173_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	During 2017 , we opened 190 net, new stores and we plan to open approximately 200 net, new stores in 2018 , which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets.
898173_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O Reilly stores.
898173_18_ITEM1_P19_S3	We typically open new stores by (i) constructing a new facility or renovating an existing one on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory; (ii) acquiring an independently owned auto parts store, typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store; or (iii) purchasing multi-store chains.
898173_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	New store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, vehicles in operation, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius.
898173_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	We target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network.
898173_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	While we have faced, and expect to continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets and to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets.
898173_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_18_ITEM1_P21_S3	Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.
898173_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Grow Sales in Existing Stores: Profitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy.
898173_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	We believe that while competitive pricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service that generates increased sales and profitability.
898173_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions: The automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, such as ourselves, to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation.
898173_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new markets.
898173_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	Continually Enhance Store Design and Location: Our current prototype store design features optimized square footage, high ceilings, convenient interior store layouts, in-store signage, bright lighting, convenient ingress and egress and parking, and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies and enhance overall customer service.
898173_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance.
898173_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	During 2017 , we relocated 22 stores and renovated 25 stores.
898173_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best serve our customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	Enhance and Improve Customer Omnichannel Experience:
898173_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	Regardless of how our customers begin their interaction, whether in-store, over the telephone or electronically, and complete their transaction, whether in-store or delivery to their home or business, our goal is to provide excellent customer service and a seamless experience.
898173_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	Our user-friendly websites, www.oreillyauto.com and www.firstcallonline.com , allow our customers to search product and repair content, check the in-store availability of our products, and place orders for either delivery or in-store pickup.
898173_18_ITEM1_P26_S3	We continue to enhance the functionality of our websites to provide our customers with a user-friendly and convenient shopping experience, as well as a robust product and repair content information resource, which will continue to build the O Reilly Brand.
898173_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	As of January 31, 2018 , we employed 75,289 Team Members ( 45,440 full-time Team Members and 29,849 part-time Team Members), of whom 64,104 were employed at our stores, 8,148 were employed at our DCs and 3,037 were employed at our corporate and regional offices.
898173_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	A union represents 49 stores ( 477 Team Members) in the Greater Bay Area in California and has for many years.
898173_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	In addition, approximately 67 Team Members who drive over-the-road trucks in two of our DCs are represented by labor unions.
898173_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	Except for these Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions.
898173_18_ITEM1_P28_S3	Our tradition for 61 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our Live Green culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member s contribution to the success of O Reilly.
898173_18_ITEM1_P28_S4	This focus on professionalism and respect has created an industry-leading team, and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent.
898173_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	In selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising and distribution.
898173_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	the type and size of store that should be developed.
898173_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	When entering new, more densely populated markets, we generally seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale.
898173_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas.
898173_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	As these store clusters mature, we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas.
898173_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.
898173_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Store Locations and Size: As a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.
898173_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	Our stores, on average, carry approximately 23,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,300 total square feet in size.
898173_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	At December 31, 2017 , we had a total of approximately 37 million square feet in our 5,019 stores.
898173_18_ITEM1_P32_S3	Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which averages 157,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 331 Hub stores, which, on average, carry approximately 48,000 SKUs and average approximately 10,900 square feet in size.
898173_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	We believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity.
898173_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking, easy customer access and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	The following table sets forth the geographic distribution and activity of our stores as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 :
898173_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	Store Layout: We utilize a computer-assisted store layout system to provide a uniform and consistent front room retail merchandise presentation and customize our hard-parts inventory assortment to meet the specific needs of each particular market area.
898173_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	Front room merchandise is arranged to provide easy customer access, maximum selling space and to prominently display high-turnover products and accessories to customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	To ensure the best customer experience possible, we have selectively implemented bilingual, in-store signage based on the demographics in each store s geographic area.
898173_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Aisle displays and end caps are used to feature high-demand, seasonal merchandise, new items and advertised specials.
898173_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Store Automation: To enhance store-level operations and provide consistently high levels of customer service, we operate exclusive store automation systems that deliver quick point-of-sale transaction processing times, reduce our customers checkout time, ensure accuracy and provide our Professional Parts People with immediate access to our proprietary electronic parts catalog, part images, technical schematics and pricing information based on each individual customer s specific vehicle make, model and year.
898173_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	These systems track in-store inventory availability and, through connectivity with our DC and corporate systems, allow real-time access to inventory available in nearby stores and DCs throughout our network.
898173_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	Our systems also capture detailed sales information, which assists management in strategic planning, inventory control and distribution efficiency, and provide a mechanism to deliver ongoing Team Member training through our integrated digital learning platform.
898173_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Each of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store.
898173_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	Each of our 496 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of ten stores, which provides our stores with a strong operational support.
898173_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model.
898173_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri.
898173_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	Store and district managers also receive continuous training through online training, field workshops, regional meetings and our annual managers conference.
898173_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through incentive compensation programs.
898173_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	Under our incentive compensation programs, base salary is augmented by incentive compensation based on individual and store sales and profitability.
898173_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	In addition, each of our district managers participates in our stock option and bonus programs, and store managers participate in bonus programs based on their store s performance.
898173_18_ITEM1_P40_S3	We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our store Team Members and enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.
898173_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	We believe our highly trained team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	A significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers; therefore, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products.
898173_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from Professional Parts People, particularly when purchasing hard parts.
898173_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.
898173_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	We screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts or repairs, or automotive aptitude.
898173_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company, as well as the requirements for their specific position.
898173_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P42_S3	Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O Reilly Certified Parts Professional test.
898173_18_ITEM1_P42_S4	Passing the O Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence ( ASE ).
898173_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	All of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager.
898173_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	Additionally, each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.
898173_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	We believe that our tiered distribution model provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions, while lowering our inventory carrying costs by controlling the depth of our inventory.
898173_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	Moreover, we believe our ongoing, significant capital investments made in our DC network allow us to efficiently service new stores that are planned to open in contiguous market areas as well as servicing our existing store network.
898173_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	Our distribution expansion strategy complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores, and additional penetration into existing markets, in the regions surrounding each DC.
898173_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Distribution Centers: As of December 31, 2017 , we operated 27 DCs comprised of approximately 10.8 million operating square feet (see the Properties table in Item 2 of this annual report on Form 10-K for a detailed listing of DC operating square footages).
898173_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our DCs stock an average of 157,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have the ability to access multiple other regional DCs inventory.
898173_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to all of our stores in the continental United States.
898173_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	In addition, stores within an individual DC s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC s city counter, many of which receive this service seven days per week.
898173_18_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our DCs provide weekend service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute products to surrounding stores.
898173_18_ITEM1_P47_S3	Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores.
898173_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	make proven, return-on-investment based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs, including conveyor systems, picking modules, lift equipment and computer hardware.
898173_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Hub stores: We currently operate 331 strategically located Hub stores.
898173_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis.
898173_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our Hub stores average approximately 10,900 square feet and carry an average of 48,000 SKUs.
898173_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans and trucks.
898173_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products, such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, BWD, Cardone, Castrol, Gates Rubber, Monroe, Moog, Pennzoil, Prestone, Quaker State, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, Wagner, and Wix, and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products, which span the entire good, better and best value spectrum, under our BestTest , BrakeBest , Import Direct , Master Pro , Micro-Gard , Murray , Omnispark , O Reilly Auto Parts , Precision , Power Torque , Super Start , and Ultima brands.
898173_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Our proprietary private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers, meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary bands, which we have acquired or developed over time.
898173_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	Our good proprietary brands provide a great combination of quality and value, a characteristic important to our DIY customers, while our better and best proprietary brands offer options for our more heavy-duty DIY customers, as well as our professional service provider customers, who often prefer higher quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses.
898173_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	We have no long-term contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts.
898173_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell.
898173_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	We have entered into various programs and arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases.
898173_18_ITEM1_P51_S4	As a whole, we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good.
898173_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	We purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 950 suppliers, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 24% of our total purchases in 2017 .
898173_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our largest supplier in 2017 accounted for approximately 6% of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3% to 5% of our total purchases.
898173_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	Marketing to the DIY Customer: We use an integrated marketing program, which includes radio, direct mail and newspaper distribution, in-store, digital, and social media promotions, and sports and event sponsorships, to aggressively attract DIY customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	The marketing strategy we employ is highly effective and has led to a measurable increase in awareness of the O Reilly Brand across our geographic footprint.
898173_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	We utilize a combination of brand, product and price messaging to drive retail traffic and purchases, which frequently coincide with key sales events.
898173_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	We also utilize a problem-resolution communication strategy, which encourages vehicle owners to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles, protecting their long-term automotive investment and establishing O Reilly as their partner for auto parts needs.
898173_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	To stimulate sales among racing enthusiasts, who we believe individually spend more on automotive products than the general public, we sponsored multiple nationally-televised races and over 1,600 grassroots, local and regional motorsports events throughout 47 states during 2017 .
898173_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	During the fall and winter months, we strategically sponsor National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) basketball.
898173_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our relationships with over 30 NCAA teams and tournaments have resulted in prominently displayed O Reilly logos on TV-visible signs throughout the season.
898173_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	We target Spanish-speaking auto parts customers through marketing efforts that include the use of Spanish language radio, print, and outdoor advertising, as well as sponsorships of local and regional festivals and events.
898173_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	We invest in digital channels to expand the O Reilly brand presence online and through mobile devices, as this continues to be an important point of contact with our customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	Search engine optimization and paid search strategies are used to drive traffic to our website, and popular social media platforms are used to provide excellent customer service through interaction and dialogue with our customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	To show appreciation for our DIY customers for their continued business, we maintain our O Reilly O Rewards customer loyalty program.
898173_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	The program provides members with the opportunity to earn points through purchases and other special events and allows members to redeem those points for coupons, which provide discounts on future merchandise purchases in our stores.
898173_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	The programs allow us to reward our customers for their continued business, as well as enhance engagement with our customers to earn more of their business with targeted promotions tailored to their specific needs and purchasing patterns.
898173_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	Marketing to the Professional Service Provider Customer: We have approximately 780 full-time O Reilly sales representatives strategically located across our market areas as part of our First Call program.
898173_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	Each sales representative is dedicated solely to calling upon, selling to and servicing our professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	Targeted marketing materials such as flyers, quick reference guides and catalogs are produced and distributed on a regular basis to professional service providers, paint and body shops and fleet customers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P59_S3	Our industry-leading First Call program enables our sales representatives, district managers, and store managers to provide excellent customer service to each of our professional service provider customers by providing the products and services identified below:
898173_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	Certified Auto Repair Center Program, a program that provides professional service provider customers with business tools they can utilize to profitably grow and market their shops.
898173_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	Marketing to the Independently Owned Parts Store: We also sell automotive products directly to independently owned parts stores ( jobber stores ) in certain market areas.
898173_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	These jobber stores are generally located in areas not directly serviced by an O Reilly store.
898173_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	We administer a proprietary, dedicated and distinct marketing program specifically targeted to jobber stores called Parts City Auto Parts that currently provides automotive products to approximately 180 jobber stores, with total annual sales of approximately $61 million .
898173_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	As a participant in this program, a jobber store, which meets certain financial and operational standards, is permitted to indicate its Parts City Auto Parts membership through the display of a trademarked logo owned by us.
898173_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	In return for a commitment to purchase automotive products from us, we provide computer software for business management, competitive pricing, advertising, marketing and sales assistance to Parts City Auto Parts affiliate stores.
898173_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	We believe that competitive pricing is essential to successfully operate in the automotive aftermarket business.
898173_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	Product pricing is generally established to compete with the pricing of competitors in the market area served by each store.
898173_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	Most products that we sell are priced based upon a combination of internal gross margin targets and competitive reviews, with additional savings offered on some items through special promotional pricing and volume discounts.
898173_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	Consistent with our low price guarantee, each of our stores will match any verifiable price on any in-stock, locally available product of the same or comparable quality offered by our competitors.
898173_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our stores accept cash, checks, debit and credit cards.
898173_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	We also grant credit to many professional service provider customers who meet our pre-established credit requirements.
898173_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	Some of the factors considered in our pre-established credit requirements include customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_18_ITEM1_P65_S3	No customer accounted for greater than one percent of our consolidated net sales, nor do we have any dependence on any single customer.
898173_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	We accept product returns for new products, core products and warranty/defective products.
898173_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	The automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale.
898173_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	The total size of the automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $287 billion , according to The Auto Care Association.
898173_18_ITEM1_P67_S2	This market is made up of four segments: labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales and tire sales.
898173_18_ITEM1_P67_S3	Reilly s addressable market within this industry is approximately $90 billion , which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales and DIY sales.
898173_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations.
898173_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	The sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition and price.
898173_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market.
898173_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	mass merchandisers and online retailers that carry automotive replacement parts, maintenance items and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc.).
898173_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	We compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency and helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout and convenient and accessible store locations.
898173_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.
898173_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	We have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	To the extent our acquisition costs increase due to price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_18_ITEM1_P73_S2	As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation.
898173_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	To some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	Store sales, profits and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	We are subject to federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, including, but not limited to, those related to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.
898173_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	As part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our oil and battery recycling programs.
898173_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party suppliers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our Team Members, deposited into supplier-provided containers and pallets, and then disposed of by the third-party suppliers.
898173_18_ITEM1_P77_S3	In general, our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the supplier.
898173_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	Compliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date.
898173_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	However, we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.

898173_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others, with which we do business, to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Many of these factors are outside of our control.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our customers purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions or political uncertainty.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In addition, restrictions on access to telematics, diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P2_S6	If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the U.S., the total number of registered vehicles in the U.S., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the U.S.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Furthermore, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Both the do-it-yourself ( DIY ) and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Online and mobile platforms may allow customers to quickly compare prices and product assortments between us and a range of competitors, which could result in pricing pressure.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Some online competitors may have a lower cost structure than we do, as a result of our strategy of providing an exceptional in-store experience and superior parts availability supported by our extensive store network and robust, regional distribution footprint, which could also create pricing pressure.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P4_S6	We may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive, and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P4_S7	For a list of our principal competitors, see the Competition section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions, and natural disasters.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to DIY customers.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In addition, our stores and distribution centers ( DCs ) located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We cannot assure future growth will be achieved.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning, and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2018 and beyond will be achieved.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	For a discussion of our growth strategies, see the Growth Strategy section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Our business, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient and, as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P7_S7	For a discussion of our management, see the Business section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	For example, financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In addition, the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers, as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries, may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to, or difficulties in the, manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Changes in U.S. trade policies, practices, tariffs or taxes could affect our ability and our suppliers ability to source product at current volumes and/or prices.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following:
898173_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our management s attention may be distracted.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other benefits.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may fail, or be unable to, discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we or the subsequent owner or operator may be liable.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, operability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters, or the threat of them, may result in the closure of one or more of our DCs or other facilities, or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	This may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or other catastrophic events.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We believe our Company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Brand value is based, in large part, on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or Team Members.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	If we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our stock price would likely suffer.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations and failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.

898173_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

898173_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Environmental legislation and regulations, like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change, could adversely impact all industries.
898173_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	While it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, by, among other things, increasing fuel prices.

898173_18_ITEM7_P10_S5	We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles.
898173_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	As the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty.
898173_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles.
898173_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Unemployment Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending.
898173_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Long-term trends of high unemployment have historically impeded the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry.
898173_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	As of December 31, 2016, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.7% , and as of December 31, 2017 , the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 4.1% .
898173_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	We believe total employment should remain at healthy levels supporting the trend of modest growth in total miles driven in the U.S. and the continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
898173_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.
898173_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:
898173_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Under the Company s share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors in January of 2011, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	As announced on May 10, 2017 , September 1, 2017 , and February 7, 2018 , our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $1.00 billion , resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $10.75 billion .
898173_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Each additional authorization is effective for a three -year period, beginning on its respective announcement date.
898173_18_ITEM7_P15_S4	As of February 28, 2018 , we had repurchased approximately 67.4 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $9.32 billion under this program.
898173_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	On April 5, 2017 , we entered into a new credit agreement.
898173_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	The new credit agreement provided for a $1.20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in April 2022 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 :
898173_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	(1) Each percentage of sales amount is computed independently and may not compute to presented totals.
898173_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased $385 million to $8.98 billion from $8.59 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 4% .
898173_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 1.4% and 4.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
898173_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from Leap Day during the year ended December 31, 2016.
898173_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 (in millions):
898173_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2017, Compared to the Same Period in 2016 Store sales:
898173_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Sales from Leap Day in 2016 (25 ) Sales in 2016 for stores that have closed (5 ) Non-store sales:
898173_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, sales from the 48 acquired Bond stores, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles.
898173_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	These better engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time.
898173_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	When repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values; however, the decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts.
898173_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	In addition, customer transaction counts for the year ended December 31, 2017, were negatively impacted by softer industry demand, resulting, in part, from the unseasonably mild winter weather at the onset of 2017 and a cool, wet summer in many of our markets.
898173_18_ITEM7_P24_S4	The mild winter weather did not stress vehicle components to the degree more typical harsh winter weather would, which resulted in a lower level of automobile parts breakage and associated demand for our products.
898173_18_ITEM7_P24_S5	The cool, wet summer in many of our markets resulted in a lower level of demand, as the absence of typical seasonally high temperatures resulted in fewer heat related product repairs.
898173_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	We opened 190 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to opening 210 net, new stores and acquiring 48 Bond stores during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we operated 5,019 stores in 47 states compared to 4,829 stores in 47 states at December 31, 2016 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	We anticipate new store growth will be 200 net, new store openings in 2018 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased to $4.72 billion (or 52.6% of sales) from $4.51 billion (or 52.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 5% .
898173_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily a result of sales from new stores, the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from the 48 acquired Bond stores, partially offset by prior year gross profit dollars generated from one additional day due to Leap Day.
898173_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a smaller non-cash last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) impact, partially offset by a lower merchandise margin and higher inventory shrinkage.
898173_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	The smaller LIFO impact is the result of fewer product acquisition cost improvements during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period one year ago.
898173_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost.
898173_18_ITEM7_P26_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our LIFO inventory costs were written down by approximately $22 million and $49 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost.
898173_18_ITEM7_P26_S6	The lower merchandise margin was primarily the result of merchandise mix, driven by the unfavorable weather conditions during 2017.
898173_18_ITEM7_P26_S7	The higher inventory shrinkage was primarily cyclical in nature, following a period of lower than average shrinkage trends.
898173_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased to $3.00 billion (or 33.4% of sales) from $2.81 billion (or 32.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7% .
898173_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, partially offset by a $9.1 million benefit from the reduction in our legal accrual following the expiration of the statute of limitations related to a legacy claim and prior year incremental SG A expenses incurred from one additional day due to Leap Day.
898173_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	The increase in SG A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to deleverage of store operating costs on soft comparable store sales during the current period.
898173_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased to $1.73 billion (or 19.2% of sales) from $1.70 billion (or 19.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 2% .
898173_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased to $88 million (or 1.0% of sales), from $62 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 41% .
898173_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 , was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs.
898173_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 , decreased to $504 million ( 30.8% effective tax rate) from $600 million ( 36.6% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing a decrease of 16% .
898173_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ) in 2017, which provided a benefit of $49 million to the provision for income taxes.
898173_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities, which provided a one-time benefit of 325 basis points to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2017, which provided a benefit of 297 basis points to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017.
898173_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased to $1.13 billion (or 12.6% of sales), from $1.04 billion (or 12.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9% .
898173_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased 18% to $12.67 on 90 million shares from $10.73 on 97 million shares for the same period one year ago.
898173_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Due to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities, our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, included a one-time benefit of $0.59 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	Due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, included a benefit of $0.50 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased $626 million to $8.59 billion from $7.97 billion for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 8%.
898173_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.8% and 7.5% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
898173_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from Leap Day during the year ended December 31, 2016.
898173_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 (in millions):
898173_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2016, Compared to the Same Period in 2015 Store sales:
898173_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Sales in 2015 for stores that have closed (4 ) Non-store sales:
898173_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, sales from one additional day due to Leap Day for the year ended December 31, 2016, sales from the acquired 48 Bond stores, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2016, was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts from both our DIY and professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles.
898173_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	These better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time.
898173_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	This decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values.
898173_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	Customer transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, despite the added pressure from the better engineered, more technically advanced vehicles requiring less frequent repairs.
898173_18_ITEM7_P38_S5	The increase in customer transaction counts was supported by an increase in miles driven, and the corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance, lower year-over-year gas prices and decreasing unemployment levels, creating an overall positive macroeconomic environment.
898173_18_ITEM7_P38_S6	The increase in our DIY customer transaction counts benefited from our continued focus on ensuring our stores are staffed with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, such as nights and weekends.
898173_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	increase in our professional service provider customer transaction counts benefited from the continued growth of our less mature markets and our better parts and service availability.
898173_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	We opened 210 net, new stores and acquired 48 Bond stores during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to opening 205 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2015.
898173_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we operated 4,829 stores in 47 states compared to 4,571 stores in 44 states at December 31, 2015.
898173_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $4.51 billion (or 52.5% of sales) from $4.16 billion (or 52.3% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 8%.
898173_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores, sales from new stores and one additional day due to Leap Day.
898173_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, partially offset by a larger LIFO impact.
898173_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	Product acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale.
898173_18_ITEM7_P41_S4	The non-cash LIFO impact is the result of these continued product acquisition cost reductions, and due to these reductions, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve in 2013.
898173_18_ITEM7_P41_S5	Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we were effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost.
898173_18_ITEM7_P41_S6	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $49 million and $28 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost.
898173_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses: SG A for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $2.81 billion (or 32.7% of sales) from $2.65 billion (or 33.2% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 6%.
898173_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	The increase in total SG A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and one additional day due to Leap Day.
898173_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on comparable store sales growth and a $19 million litigation loss charge in 2015, resulting from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider.
898173_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $1.70 billion (or 19.8% of sales) from $1.51 billion (or 19.0% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 12%.
898173_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $62 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $54 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 16%.
898173_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs, partially offset by an increase in the value of our trading securities.
898173_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $600 million (36.6% effective tax rate) from $529 million (36.2% effective tax rate) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 13%.
898173_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, was the result of higher taxable income in 2016, primarily driven by our strong operating results, and higher effective tax rates.
898173_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a larger amount of favorable resolutions of historical tax matters in 2015, compared to 2016, and a smaller benefit in 2016 from the realization of employment tax credits.
898173_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $1.04 billion (or 12.1% of sales), from $931 million (or 11.7% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 11%.
898173_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased 17% to $10.73 on 97 million shares from $9.17 on 102 million shares for the same period one year prior.
898173_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program.
898173_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations.
898173_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
898173_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
898173_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels.
898173_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in millions):
898173_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.
898173_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	(2) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.
898173_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Current assets increased 4% , current liabilities increased 7% , total debt increased 58% and total equity decreased 60% from 2016 to 2017.
898173_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	The increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory, resulting from the opening of 190 net, new stores in 2017.
898173_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable, resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings.
898173_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 106.0% as of December 31, 2017, as compared to 105.7% in the prior year.
898173_18_ITEM7_P52_S4	The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of $750 million of 3.600% Senior Notes due 2027 and borrowings of $346 million on our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017.
898173_18_ITEM7_P52_S5	The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity, under our share repurchase program, on retained deficit and additional paid-in-capital, partially offset by a decrease in retained deficit from net income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
898173_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
898173_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	(1) Prior period amount has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company s adoption of a new accounting standard during the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.
898173_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	(2) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures and excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments for the period.
898173_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Operating activities: The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a smaller decrease in our net inventory investment, partially offset by an increase in net income.
898173_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers.
898173_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 106.0% , 105.7% and 99.1% as of December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
898173_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	The smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2017 was primarily attributable to fewer new suppliers entering our supplier financing programs in 2017 and a smaller decrease in net inventory, due to a softer sales environment, as compared to 2016.
898173_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable.
898173_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 105.7%, 99.1% and 94.6% as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
898173_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	The larger increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2016 was primarily attributable to incrementally better terms from our suppliers and additional suppliers participating in our supplier financing programs.
898173_18_ITEM7_P57_S3	The decrease from income taxes payable in 2016, compared to the increase in income taxes payable in 2015, was primarily the result of a prepaid income taxes position at the end of 2016, versus an income taxes payable position at the end of 2015.
898173_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Investing activities: The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of a decrease in other investing activities and a decrease in capital expenditures in 2017.
898173_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	The decrease in other investing activities was primarily due to less acquisition related expenditures in 2017, as compared to 2016.
898173_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	Total capital expenditures were $466 million and $476 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and the decrease was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions, closings, construction costs for new stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores opened during 2017, as compared to 2016.
898173_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures and other investing activities in 2016.
898173_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	Total capital expenditures were $476 million and $414 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and the increase was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions, closing and construction costs for new stores and our distribution expansion projects during 2016, as compared to 2015.
898173_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	The increase in other investing activities was primarily due to small acquisitions during 2016.
898173_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	We opened 190 , 210 , and 205 net, new stores in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and acquired 48 Bond stores in 2016.
898173_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	We plan to open 200 net, new stores in 2018 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	The current costs associated with the opening of a new store, including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $1.6 million to $1.8 million ; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.
898173_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Financing activities: The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2017, as compared to 2016, partially offset by a higher level of net borrowings during 2017, as compared to 2016.
898173_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during 2016, partially offset by a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2016, as compared to 2015.
898173_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Unsecured revolving credit facility: On April 5, 2017 , the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ).
898173_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	The new Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $1.20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in April 2022 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	The new Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings.
898173_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	As described in the new Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company may, from time to time, subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $600 million , provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments does not exceed $1.80 billion at any time.
898173_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	In conjunction with the closing of the new Credit Agreement, the Company s previous credit agreement, which was originally entered into on January 14, 2011, as amended, was terminated (the Terminated Credit Agreement ), and all outstanding loans and commitments, including the guarantees of each of the subsidiary guarantors, under the Terminated Credit Agreement were terminated and replaced by the loans and commitments under the new Credit Agreement.
898173_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	None of our subsidiaries are guarantors or obligors under the new Credit Agreement.
898173_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amounts of $37 million and $39 million , respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the new Credit Agreement by those amounts.
898173_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $346 million .
898173_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our terminated unsecured revolving credit facility.
898173_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Senior Notes: On August 17, 2017 , we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.600% Senior Notes due 2027 ( 3.600% Senior Notes due 2027 ) at a price to the public of 99.840% of their face value with UMB Bank, N.A. ( UMB ) as trustee.
898173_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	3.600% Senior Notes due 2027 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2018, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year.
898173_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	We have issued a cumulative $2.65 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, which are due between 2021 and 2027 , with UMB as trustee.
898173_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	Interest on the senior notes, ranging from 3.550% to 4.875% , is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year.
898173_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	None of our subsidiaries are guarantors under the Senior Notes.
898173_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the indentures.
898173_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.
898173_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.
898173_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50 :1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50 :1.00.
898173_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges.
898173_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense.
898173_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense.
898173_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt.
898173_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders.
898173_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.72 times and 6.15 times as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.98 times and 1.51 times as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.
898173_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):
898173_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	The table below outlines the calculation of Free cash flow and reconciles Free cash flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
898173_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	(1) Prior period amount has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company s adoption of a new accounting standard during the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.
898173_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
898173_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.
898173_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the Credit Agreement.
898173_18_ITEM7_P78_S3	We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
898173_18_ITEM7_P78_S4	Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.
898173_18_ITEM7_P78_S5	We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
898173_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Share repurchase program: In January of 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program.
898173_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions.
898173_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.
898173_18_ITEM7_P79_S3	As announced on May 10, 2017 , September 1, 2017 , and February 7, 2018 , our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $1.00 billion , resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $10.75 billion .
898173_18_ITEM7_P79_S4	Each additional authorization is effective for a three -year period, beginning on its respective announcement date.
898173_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data):
898173_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we had $715 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
898173_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 28, 2018 , we repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $255.48 , for a total investment of $290 million .
898173_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	We have repurchased a total of 67 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 28, 2018 , at an average price of $138.38 for a total aggregate investment of $9.32 billion .
898173_18_ITEM7_P81_S3	As of February 28, 2018 , we had approximately $1.43 billion remaining under our share repurchase program.
898173_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 , included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 Leasing, Note 9 Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans and Note 10 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment s cancellation terms.
898173_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2018 , which are included in Current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
898173_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 12 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined.
898173_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , we recorded a net liability of $41 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included in Other liabilities.
898173_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	We record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the Company s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is fully disclosed in Note 9 Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
898173_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	This estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined.
898173_18_ITEM7_P85_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , we recorded a liability of $26 million related to this uncertain liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included in Other liabilities.
898173_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	The following table identifies the estimated payments of the Company s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):
898173_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	(1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.20 billion and matures in April 2022 , bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Alternate Base Rate or Eurodollar Revolving Loans(both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.000% to 0.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate and 0.680% to 1.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Revolving Loan, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.
898173_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above.
898173_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.070% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.
898173_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Alternate Base Rate loans was 0.000% , our margin for Eurodollar Revolving Loans was 0.9% and our facility fee was 0.100% .
898173_18_ITEM7_P87_S4	As of December 31, 2017 , we had outstanding borrowings in the amount of $346 million under our Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_18_ITEM7_P87_S5	(2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year.
898173_18_ITEM7_P87_S6	These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments.
898173_18_ITEM7_P87_S7	See Note 6 Leasing to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.
898173_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits.
898173_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount.
898173_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	See Note 10 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.
898173_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
898173_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.
898173_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies.
898173_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance.
898173_18_ITEM7_P91_S3	Letters of credit totaling $37 million and $39 million were outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
898173_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
898173_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	See Contractual Obligations section of Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K and Note 6 Leasing to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.
898173_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management.
898173_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
898173_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates.
898173_18_ITEM7_P93_S3	Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP.
898173_18_ITEM7_P93_S4	However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.
898173_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink: Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal.
898173_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population.
898173_18_ITEM7_P94_S3	We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand.
898173_18_ITEM7_P94_S4	We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of products is lower than our recorded cost.
898173_18_ITEM7_P94_S5	This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods.
898173_18_ITEM7_P94_S6	Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances.
898173_18_ITEM7_P94_S7	We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future.
898173_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink.
898173_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories.
898173_18_ITEM7_P95_S2	To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances.
898173_18_ITEM7_P95_S3	We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates.
898173_18_ITEM7_P95_S4	If the shrink reserve changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2017 , the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or less than 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill:
898173_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment.
898173_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset.
898173_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	The estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations.
898173_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.
898173_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets.
898173_18_ITEM7_P100_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment.
898173_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	We have never recorded an impairment to goodwill.
898173_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach.
898173_18_ITEM7_P101_S3	Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value.
898173_18_ITEM7_P101_S4	In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2017 , nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing.
898173_18_ITEM7_P101_S5	If the price of O Reilly s stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.
898173_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	Supplier Concessions: We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates.
898173_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales.
898173_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns.
898173_18_ITEM7_P103_S3	Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations.
898173_18_ITEM7_P103_S4	Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations.
898173_18_ITEM7_P103_S5	The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
898173_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	Warranty Reserves: We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties.
898173_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers.
898173_18_ITEM7_P104_S2	Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims.
898173_18_ITEM7_P104_S3	For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims.
898173_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	Differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of sales.
898173_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line.
898173_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims.
898173_18_ITEM7_P105_S3	If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2017 , the financial impact would have been approximately $4 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	Self-Insurance Reserves: We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits.
898173_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim.
898173_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations.
898173_18_ITEM7_P107_S2	Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date, and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities.
898173_18_ITEM7_P107_S3	Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains.
898173_18_ITEM7_P107_S4	As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information.
898173_18_ITEM7_P107_S5	These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate.
898173_18_ITEM7_P107_S6	These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.
898173_18_ITEM7_P107_S7	We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities.
898173_18_ITEM7_P107_S8	If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2017 , the financial impact would have been approximately $14 million or 0.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	Legal Reserves: We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation, for which O Reilly is currently involved.
898173_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business.
898173_18_ITEM7_P108_S2	Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures.
898173_18_ITEM7_P108_S3	If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2017 , the financial impact would have been approximately $3 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	Taxes: We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
898173_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve.
898173_18_ITEM7_P109_S2	We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit.
898173_18_ITEM7_P109_S3	The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings.
898173_18_ITEM7_P109_S4	Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations.
898173_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented.
898173_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates.
898173_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position.
898173_18_ITEM7_P110_S3	While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results, except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority.
898173_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	For the last three fiscal years, we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying.
898173_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.
898173_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.
898173_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.
898173_18_ITEM7_P113_S1	While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.
898173_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	The following tables set forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments, which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown (in thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data):
898173_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	(1) Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for each quarter and annual period.
898173_18_ITEM7_P115_S1	The quarterly earnings per share amounts may not sum to equal the full-year earnings per share amount.
898173_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	The unaudited operating data presented above should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.
898173_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	In May of 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ).
898173_18_ITEM7_P117_S1	Under ASU 2014-09, an entity is required to follow a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to recognize when promised goods or services are transferred to customers.
898173_18_ITEM7_P117_S2	ASU 2014-09 offers specific accounting guidance for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.
898173_18_ITEM7_P117_S3	In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
898173_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	In August of 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ), to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.
898173_18_ITEM7_P118_S1	For public companies, ASU 2015-14 changes ASU 2014-09 to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
898173_18_ITEM7_P118_S2	These ASUs can be adopted retrospectively or as a cumulative-effective adjustment at the date of adoption.
898173_18_ITEM7_P118_S3	We have substantially completed our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09, and we will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method.
898173_18_ITEM7_P118_S4	Results for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2017, will be presented under ASU 2014-09, while prior period amounts will not be adjusted and will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior periods.
898173_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	obligations are satisfied immediately when the parts are delivered to the customer, which normally occurs the same day the customer orders the part.
898173_18_ITEM7_P119_S1	As such, the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; further, we do not expect significant changes to our business process, internal controls or systems as a result of adopting ASU 2014-09.
898173_18_ITEM7_P120_S0	In February of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ).
898173_18_ITEM7_P120_S1	Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.
898173_18_ITEM7_P120_S2	ASU 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions.
898173_18_ITEM7_P120_S3	Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
898173_18_ITEM7_P121_S0	For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted.
898173_18_ITEM7_P121_S1	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2019.
898173_18_ITEM7_P121_S2	We have established a task force, composed of multiple functional groups inside of the Company, which is currently in the process of evaluating critical components of this new guidance and the potential impact of the guidance on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
898173_18_ITEM7_P121_S3	Based on the preliminary work completed, we are considering the potential implications of the new standard on determining the discount rate to be used in valuing new and existing leases, the treatment of existing favorable and unfavorable lease agreements acquired in connection with previous acquisitions, procedural and operational changes that may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the guidance and all applicable financial statement disclosures required by the guidance, all of which are areas that could potentially be impacted by adoption of the guidance.
898173_18_ITEM7_P121_S4	At this time, the task force has not completed its full evaluation; however, we believe the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on the total assets and total liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheets.
898173_18_ITEM7_P122_S0	In March of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ).
898173_18_ITEM7_P122_S1	Under ASU 2016-09, several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including tax consequence, classification of awards as equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows, were changed.
898173_18_ITEM7_P122_S2	We adopted this guidance with our first quarter ending March 31, 2017.
898173_18_ITEM7_P122_S3	Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09, we elected to change our accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur; this change was applied using the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment of $0.3 million to opening Retained earnings on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P122_S4	We applied the amendments related to the presentation of tax withholdings on the statements of cash flows using the retrospective transition method, which resulted in $0.6 million and $0.9 million of tax withholdings being reclassified from Net cash provided by operating activities to Net cash used in financing activities on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
898173_18_ITEM7_P122_S5	We elected to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statements of cash flows using the retrospective transition method, which resulted in $56.0 million and $63.1 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation being reclassified from Net cash used in financing activities to Net cash provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
898173_18_ITEM7_P122_S6	ASU 2016-09 amendments related to accounting for excess tax benefits in the income statement have been adopted prospectively, resulting in the reduction of $48.7 million in Provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 , which lowered our effective tax rate, increased dilutive shares outstanding and increased diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 , by $0.50 .
898173_18_ITEM7_P123_S0	In June of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13 ).
898173_18_ITEM7_P123_S1	Under ASU 2016-13, businesses and other organizations are required to present financial assets, measured at amortized costs basis, at the net amount expected to be collected.
898173_18_ITEM7_P123_S2	The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis, such as trade receivables.
898173_18_ITEM7_P123_S3	The measurement of expected credit loss will be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount.
898173_18_ITEM7_P124_S0	For public companies, ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted.
898173_18_ITEM7_P124_S1	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2020.
898173_18_ITEM7_P124_S2	The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_18_ITEM7_P125_S0	In August of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) ( ASU 2016-15 ).
898173_18_ITEM7_P125_S1	ASU 2016-15 reduces the existing diversity in practice for eight specific parts on cash flow statement presentation and classification: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies; distributions received from equity method investments; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.
898173_18_ITEM7_P126_S0	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018.
898173_18_ITEM7_P126_S1	The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_18_ITEM7_P127_S0	In January of 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01 ).
898173_18_ITEM7_P127_S1	ASU 2017-01 revises the definition of a business in the Accounting Standards Codification and clarifies the guidance for determining whether the purchase or disposal of an asset or group of assets qualifies as the purchase or disposal of a business.
898173_18_ITEM7_P127_S2	For public companies, ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires prospective adoption, with early adoption permitted with certain conditions.

898173_18_ITEM7_P127_S4	The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_18_ITEM7_P128_S0	In January of 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04 ).
898173_18_ITEM7_P128_S1	ASU 2017-04 eliminates the second step in the previous process for goodwill impairment testing; instead, the test is now a one-step process that calls for goodwill impairment loss to be measured as the excess of the reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value.
898173_18_ITEM7_P128_S2	For public companies, ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires prospective adoption, with early adoption after January 1, 2017.
898173_18_ITEM7_P128_S3	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2019.

898173_18_ITEM7_P129_S1	ASU 2017-09 provides clarity and reduces both the diversity in practice and cost and complexity when applying stock compensation guidance to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.
898173_18_ITEM7_P129_S2	For public companies, ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires prospective adoption, with early adoption permitted.
898173_18_ITEM7_P129_S3	We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018.
898173_18_ITEM7_P129_S4	The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
898173_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Reilly, refer to O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
898173_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) with variable interest rates based on either a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility.
898173_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we had outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $346 million , at the weighted-average variable interest rate of 2.675% .
898173_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	At this borrowing level, a 0.25% increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable annual impact on our pre-tax earnings and cash flows in the amount of $0.9 million .
898173_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $2.65 billion and $1.90 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
898173_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $2.73 billion and $1.98 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.
898173_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less.
898173_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal.
898173_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $46 million .
898173_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	The management of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company ), under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) or 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
898173_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
898173_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management recognizes that all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
898173_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
898173_18_ITEM8_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk.
898173_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
898173_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 .
898173_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework).
898173_18_ITEM8_P4_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2017 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
898173_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	Ernst Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has audited the Company s consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
898173_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have audited O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria ).
898173_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	In our opinion, O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.
898173_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	( PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 28, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
898173_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
898173_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
898173_18_ITEM8_P8_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
898173_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
898173_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
898173_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
898173_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
898173_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
898173_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
898173_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
898173_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
898173_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
898173_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
898173_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	( PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 28, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
898173_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
898173_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
898173_18_ITEM8_P15_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
898173_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
898173_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
898173_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
898173_18_ITEM8_P16_S3	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
898173_18_ITEM8_P16_S4	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
898173_18_ITEM8_P16_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

898173_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	See accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements.
898173_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Nature of business: O Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its subsidiaries, collectively, O Reilly or the Company, is a specialty retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts.
898173_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company s stores carry an extensive product line, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and various automotive accessories.
898173_18_ITEM8_P22_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company owned and operated 5,019 stores in 47 states, servicing both do-it-yourself ( DIY ) and the professional service provider customers.
898173_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company s robust distribution system provides stores with same-day or overnight access to an extensive inventory of hard-to-find items not typically stocked in the stores of other auto parts retailers.
898173_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Segment reporting: The Company is managed and operated by a single management team reporting to the chief operating decision maker.
898173_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	Reilly stores have similar characteristics, including the nature of the products and services, the type and class of customers and the methods used to distribute products and provide service to its customers and, as a whole, make up a single operating segment.
898173_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company does not prepare discrete financial information with respect to product lines, types of customers or geographic locations and as such has one reportable segment.
898173_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
898173_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
898173_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
898173_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
898173_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Cash equivalents: Cash equivalents include investments with maturities of 90 days or less on the date of purchase.
898173_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Accounts receivable: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company s customers to make required payments.
898173_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection is reasonably assured: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms.
898173_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on historical experience and an evaluation of the current composition of accounts receivable.
898173_18_ITEM8_P29_S3	Amounts due to the Company from its Team Members are included in Accounts receivable on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
898173_18_ITEM8_P29_S4	These amounts consist primarily of purchases of merchandise on Team Member accounts.
898173_18_ITEM8_P29_S5	Accounts receivable due from Team Members was approximately $0.9 million and $1.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
898173_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company s pre-established credit requirements.
898173_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to these receivables are limited because the Company s customer base consists of a large number of small customers, spreading the credit risk across a broad base.
898173_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	The Company also controls this credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and accounts receivable and credit monitoring procedures.
898173_18_ITEM8_P30_S3	Generally, the Company does not require security when credit is granted to customers.
898173_18_ITEM8_P30_S4	Credit losses are provided for in the Company s consolidated financial statements and have consistently been within management s expectations.
898173_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Amounts receivable from suppliers: The Company receives concessions from its suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for new stores and warranties, volume purchase rebates and co-operative advertising.
898173_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to the Company s advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred.
898173_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	All other supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales.
898173_18_ITEM8_P31_S3	Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to the Company for changeover merchandise and product returns.
898173_18_ITEM8_P31_S4	The Company regularly reviews supplier receivables for collectability and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectable amounts based on an evaluation of the Company s suppliers financial positions and corresponding abilities to meet financial obligations.
898173_18_ITEM8_P31_S5	Management does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the Company will be unable to collect the amounts receivable from suppliers and the Company did not record a reserve for uncollectable amounts from suppliers in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 or 2016 .
898173_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Inventory: Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market.
898173_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	Inventory also includes capitalized costs related to procurement, warehousing and distribution centers ( DC s).
898173_18_ITEM8_P32_S2	Cost has been determined using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method, which more accurately matches costs with related revenues.
898173_18_ITEM8_P32_S3	Over time, as the Company s merchandise inventory purchases have increased, the Company negotiated improved acquisition costs from its suppliers and the corresponding price deflation exhausted the Company s LIFO reserve balance.
898173_18_ITEM8_P32_S4	The Company s policy is to not write up the value of its inventory in excess of its replacement cost, and accordingly, the Company s merchandise inventory has been effectively recorded at replacement cost since December 31, 2013.
898173_18_ITEM8_P32_S5	The replacement cost of inventory was $3.01 billion and $2.78 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
898173_18_ITEM8_P32_S6	LIFO costs exceeded replacement costs by $157.3 million and $132.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
898173_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Fair value of financial instruments: The Company uses the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure the fair value of certain of its financial instruments.
898173_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
898173_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company uses the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities.
898173_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:
898173_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.
898173_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
898173_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
898173_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	See Note 2 for further information concerning the Company s financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis.
898173_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Property and equipment: Property and equipment are carried at cost.
898173_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, generally over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
898173_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated economic life of the assets.
898173_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	The lease term includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception, for which failure to execute renewal options would result in a substantial economic penalty to the Company.
898173_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
898173_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	Upon retirement or sale, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income.
898173_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
898173_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Notes receivable: Historically, the Company has utilized notes receivable from supplier and other third parties; however, during the year ended December 31, 2016, the notes receivable from suppliers and other third parties were dissolved, in connection with new supplier contracts, and during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, no new notes receivable arrangements were entered into.
898173_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Goodwill and other intangibles: The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , include goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as the result of acquisitions.
898173_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
898173_18_ITEM8_P45_S2	During 2017 and 2016 , the goodwill impairment test included a quantitative assessment, which compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill.
898173_18_ITEM8_P45_S3	The Company operates as a single reporting unit, and the Company determined that its fair value exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 ; as such, no goodwill impairment adjustment was required as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
898173_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	Finite-lived intangibles are carried at cost and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method, generally over the estimated useful lives of the intangibles.
898173_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Impairment of long-lived assets: The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
898173_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	When such an event occurs, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the asset (asset group) with the carrying amounts of the asset.
898173_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss as the amount, by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
898173_18_ITEM8_P47_S3	The Company has not historically recorded any material impairment charges to its long-lived assets and the Company did not record a material impairment charge to its long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2017 or 2016 .

898173_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	See Note 9 for further information concerning the Company s benefit plans.
898173_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	The future obligation is adjusted to reflect the performance, whether positive or negative, of selected investment measurement options, chosen by each participant.
898173_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company invests in various marketable securities with the intention of selling these securities to fulfill its future obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
898173_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	The investments in this plan were stated at fair value based on quoted market prices, were accounted for as trading securities and were included in Other assets, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
898173_18_ITEM8_P50_S2	See Note 2 for further information concerning the fair value measurements of the Company s marketable securities.
898173_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Self-insurance reserves: The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities for Team Member health care benefits, workers compensation, vehicle liability, general liability and property loss.
898173_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, the Company obtains third-party insurance coverage to limit its exposure.
898173_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts.
898173_18_ITEM8_P51_S3	Certain of these liabilities were recorded at an estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate.
898173_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The following table identifies the components of the Company s self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):
898173_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	The current portion of the Company s discounted self-insurance reserves totaled $71.7 million and $67.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, which was included in Self-insurance reserves on the accompanying Consolidate Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 .

898173_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of the Company s suppliers.
898173_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to the Company in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims.
898173_18_ITEM8_P54_S3	For this merchandise, when sold, the Company bears the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims.
898173_18_ITEM8_P54_S4	Differences between supplier allowances received by the Company, in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense, are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales.
898173_18_ITEM8_P54_S5	Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line.
898173_18_ITEM8_P54_S6	The Company s historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims to the Company has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims.
898173_18_ITEM8_P54_S7	See Note 7 for further information concerning the Company s aggregate product warranty liabilities.
898173_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	O Reilly is currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of the Company s business.

898173_18_ITEM8_P55_S2	The Company reserves for an estimate of material legal costs to be incurred in pending litigation matters.
898173_18_ITEM8_P55_S3	Although the Company cannot ascertain the amount of liability that it may incur from any of these matters, it does not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters, taking into account applicable insurance and reserves, will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.

898173_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	Income taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.
898173_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the GAAP basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rules and rates currently scheduled to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.

898173_18_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Company has established a task force, composed of multiple functional groups inside of the Company, which is currently in the process of evaluating critical components of this new guidance and the potential impact of the guidance on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
898173_18_ITEM8_P83_S3	Based on the preliminary work completed, the Company is considering the potential implications of the new standard on determining the discount rate to be used in valuing new and existing leases, the treatment of existing favorable and unfavorable lease agreements acquired in connection with previous acquisitions, procedural and operational changes that may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the guidance and all applicable financial statement disclosures required by the new guidance, all of which are areas that could potentially be impacted by adoption of the guidance.
898173_18_ITEM8_P83_S4	At this time, the task force has not completed its full evaluation; however, the Company believes the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on the total assets and total liabilities reported on the Company s consolidated balance sheets.

898173_18_ITEM8_P84_S4	The Company applied the amendments related to the presentation of tax withholdings on the statements of cash flows using the retrospective transition method, which resulted in $0.6 million and $0.9 million of tax withholdings being reclassified from Net cash provided by operating activities to Net cash used in financing activities on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
