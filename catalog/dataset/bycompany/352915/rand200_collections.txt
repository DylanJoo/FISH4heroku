352915_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers.
352915_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	As of February 28, 2011, we owned and/or operated 25 acute care hospitals and 206 behavioral health centers located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 7 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 5 states and Puerto Rico.
352915_11_ITEM1_P0_S3	In November, 2010, we completed the acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ).
352915_11_ITEM1_P0_S4	PSI was formerly the largest operator of freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities operating a total of 105 inpatient and outpatient facilities in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_11_ITEM1_P0_S5	Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 70% of our consolidated net revenues in 2010 and 74% in each of 2009 and 2008.
352915_11_ITEM1_P0_S6	Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 30% of our consolidated net revenues during 2010 and 25% during each of 2009 and 2008.
352915_11_ITEM1_P0_S7	The net revenues generated at the facilities acquired from PSI on November 15, 2010 are included from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM1_P0_S8	Approximately 1% in each of 2009 and 2008 of our consolidated net revenues were recorded in connection with two construction management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we built newly constructed acute care hospitals for an unrelated third party.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	We are a Delaware corporation that was organized in 1979.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S3	Our principal executive offices are located at Universal Corporate Center, 367 South Gulph Road, P.O. Box 61558, King of Prussia, PA 19406.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S4	Our telephone number is (610) 768-3300.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S5	Our website is located at http://www.uhsinc.com.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S6	Copies of our annual, quarterly and current reports that we file with the SEC, and any amendments to those reports, are available free of charge on our website.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S7	The information posted on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S8	Our Board of Directors committee charters (Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating Governance Committee), Code of Business Conduct and Corporate Standards applicable to all employees, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Healthcare Code of Conduct, Corporate Compliance Manual and Compliance Policies and Procedures are available free of charge on our website.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S9	Copies of such reports and charters are available in print to any stockholder who makes a request.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S10	Such requests should be made to our Secretary at our King of Prussia, PA corporate headquarters.
352915_11_ITEM1_P1_S11	We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K relating to amendments to or waivers of any provision of our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers by promptly posting this information on our website.
352915_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	In accordance with Section 303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, we submitted our CEO s certification to the New York Stock Exchange in 2010.
352915_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	Additionally, contained in Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are our CEO s and CFO s certifications regarding the quality of our public disclosures under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
352915_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our Mission Our mission and objective is to provide superior healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends, physicians prefer for their patients, purchasers select for their clients, employees are proud of, and investors seek for long-term results.
352915_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	To achieve this, we have a commitment to:
352915_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	innovation in service delivery Business Strategy We believe community-based hospitals will remain the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of self-determination for both the company and our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	We selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	We are committed to a program of rational growth around our core businesses, while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve.
352915_11_ITEM1_P4_S3	Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P4_S4	We also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.
352915_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Improvement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.
352915_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	We also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.
352915_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P5_S3	Applications to state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals are currently on file in states which require certificates of need, or CONs.
352915_11_ITEM1_P5_S4	Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.
352915_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible.
352915_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	We are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services.
352915_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures.
352915_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees, communities and our shareholders.
352915_11_ITEM1_P6_S4	In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	2010 Acquisition and Divestiture Activities Acquisitions: During 2010, we spent $1.96 billion and assumed $1.08 billion of debt on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:
352915_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	the acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. in November, 2010 for a total purchase price of $3.04 billion consisting of $1.96 billion in cash plus the assumption of approximately $1.08 billion of PSI s debt, the majority of which has since been refinanced.
352915_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of an outpatient surgery center located in Florida in which we previously held a 20% minority ownership interest.
352915_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	The purchase price consideration in connection with this transaction, which occurred during the first quarter, consisted of acquisition of the net assets less the assumption of the outstanding liabilities and third-party debt.
352915_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	Divestitures: During 2010, we received $21 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:
352915_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	the sale of the real property of Methodist Hospital located in Louisiana that was severely damaged and closed in 2005 as a result of Hurricane Katrina.
352915_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	The PSI Acquisition In November, 2010, we acquired Psychiatric Solutions Inc. for a total purchase price of $3.04 billion consisting of $1.96 billion in cash plus the assumption of approximately $1.08 billion of PSI s debt, the majority of which has since been refinanced, as discussed herein.
352915_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	PSI was formerly the largest operator of freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities operating a total of 105 inpatient and outpatient facilities in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	The facilities acquired by us, with an aggregate of approximately 11,500 licensed beds, offer an extensive continuum of behavioral health programs to critically ill children, adolescents and adults.
352915_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	We also acquired management contracts to manage freestanding behavioral health care inpatient facilities for government agencies and behavioral health units within certain medical/surgical hospitals owned by third-parties.
352915_11_ITEM1_P12_S3	Combined with our previously existing behavioral health care operations, consisting of 101 behavioral health care facilities located throughout the U. S. and Puerto Rico, we believe this acquisition makes us the largest facility-based provider in the behavioral health care sector.
352915_11_ITEM1_P12_S4	Our increased operating scale may allow us to operate more efficiently and enhance our presence within certain markets.
352915_11_ITEM1_P12_S5	We also believe we can achieve operating expense reductions during the first year following the acquisition primarily through the elimination of corporate overhead.
352915_11_ITEM1_P12_S6	This acquisition also helps diminish our geographic concentration in certain markets thereby diversifying our overall portfolio and reducing our reliance on one hospital or a cluster of hospitals in a certain market.
352915_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	We believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility.
352915_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians.
352915_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	Other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology.
352915_11_ITEM1_P14_S3	Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors.
352915_11_ITEM1_P14_S4	We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate.
352915_11_ITEM1_P14_S5	In addition, hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_11_ITEM1_P14_S6	The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated.
352915_11_ITEM1_P14_S7	Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture.
352915_11_ITEM1_P14_S8	Information related to the behavioral health care facilities acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of PSI is included for the period of November 16, 2010 through December 31, 2010, excluding the 3 former PSI facilities that are reflected as discontinued operations, as discussed herein.
352915_11_ITEM1_P14_S9	The licensed and available beds for those facilities are included in 2010 on a weighted average basis for the period owned.
352915_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	(1) Central Montgomery Medical Center located in Pennsylvania was divested during the fourth quarter of 2008.
352915_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	The statistical information for these facilities is included in the above information through the divestiture date.
352915_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	(2) Average Available Beds is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available for patient care.
352915_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	(3) Patient Days is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.
352915_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	(4) Occupancy Rate is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of average beds, either available or licensed.
352915_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Sources of Revenue We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Sources of Revenue for additional disclosure.
352915_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Reporting.
352915_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self-referrals by physicians).
352915_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected.
352915_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.
352915_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Licensing, Certification and Accreditation: All of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness.
352915_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments.
352915_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.
352915_11_ITEM1_P21_S3	All of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by the Joint Commission.
352915_11_ITEM1_P21_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P21_S5	If any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors.
352915_11_ITEM1_P21_S6	Although we believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report for disclosure regarding ongoing matters with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the California Department of Public Health in connection with our Southwest Healthcare System.
352915_11_ITEM1_P21_S7	The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Certificates of Need: Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need ( CON ) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions.
352915_11_ITEM1_P24_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_11_ITEM1_P24_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Utilization Review: Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services.
352915_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	The law and regulations require Peer Review Organizations ( PROs ) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group ( DRG ) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay.
352915_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program.
352915_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.
352915_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Audits: Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims.
352915_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights.
352915_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	The federal government contracts with third-party recovery audit contractors ( RACs ) and Medicaid integrity contractors ( MICs ), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers.
352915_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Permanent RAC audits were created by Section 302 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 and required the secretary to expand the program to all 50 states by no later than 2010.
352915_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors ( ZPICs ) target claims for potential fraud and abuse.
352915_11_ITEM1_P28_S3	Additionally, Medicare administrative contractors ( MACs ) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers.
352915_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years with no material overpayments identified.
352915_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial.
352915_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
352915_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation The Stark Law:
352915_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met.
352915_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	These types of referrals are known as self-referrals.
352915_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to $15,000 for each violation, up to $100,000 for sham arrangements, up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs.
352915_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart.
352915_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.
352915_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.
352915_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Anti-kickback Statute: A provision of the Social Security Act known as the anti-kickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program.
352915_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	However, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti-kickback statute in order to be found guilty of violating such law.
352915_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	The anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors, from the federal anti-kickback statute for various activities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services.
352915_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti- kickback statute.
352915_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws.
352915_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Similar State Laws: Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care.
352915_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure.
352915_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes.
352915_11_ITEM1_P39_S3	However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
352915_11_ITEM1_P39_S4	These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_11_ITEM1_P39_S5	It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs.
352915_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations: A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the False Claims Act s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions.
352915_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.
352915_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	When a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim.
352915_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act.
352915_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government.
352915_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds.
352915_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments.
352915_11_ITEM1_P45_S3	In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act.
352915_11_ITEM1_P45_S4	Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court.
352915_11_ITEM1_P45_S5	Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions: The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_11_ITEM1_P45_S6	False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud.
352915_11_ITEM1_P45_S7	Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.
352915_11_ITEM1_P45_S8	Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs.
352915_11_ITEM1_P45_S9	HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare.
352915_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.
352915_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:
352915_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH ), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically.
352915_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry.
352915_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information.
352915_11_ITEM1_P47_S3	The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed.
352915_11_ITEM1_P47_S4	Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.
352915_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	Compliance with the electronic data transmission standards became mandatory in October 2003.
352915_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	Since this exception expired, we believe that we have been in compliance with the electronic data transmission standards.
352915_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	We were required to comply with the privacy requirements of HIPAA by April 14, 2003.
352915_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	We believe that we were in material compliance with the privacy regulations by that date and remain so, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance.
352915_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information.
352915_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements.
352915_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	HITECH has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred.
352915_11_ITEM1_P50_S3	We were required to comply with the security regulations by April 20, 2005 and believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date.
352915_11_ITEM1_P50_S4	Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P50_S5	Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs.
352915_11_ITEM1_P50_S6	In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P50_S7	We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.
352915_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine: Several states, including Florida, Nevada and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services.
352915_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties.
352915_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable.
352915_11_ITEM1_P51_S3	These statutes and/or regulations vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.
352915_11_ITEM1_P51_S4	We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians.
352915_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.
352915_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	EMTALA: All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act ( EMTALA ).
352915_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	This federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition.
352915_11_ITEM1_P53_S2	Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment.
352915_11_ITEM1_P53_S3	There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay.
352915_11_ITEM1_P53_S4	Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program.
352915_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.
352915_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions.
352915_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	the applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively.
352915_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future.
352915_11_ITEM1_P56_S2	We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.
352915_11_ITEM1_P56_S3	Health Care Industry Investigations: We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation.
352915_11_ITEM1_P56_S4	Legal Proceedings included herein for disclosure related to False Claim Act case against certain of our behavioral health care facilities located in Virginia and California and a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implementation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators from 2003 to the present at several of our acute care facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P57_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.
352915_11_ITEM1_P57_S4	Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P57_S5	It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity.
352915_11_ITEM1_P57_S6	It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.
352915_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them.
352915_11_ITEM1_P58_S2	The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.
352915_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	State Rate Review: Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state.
352915_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	Compliance Program: Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998.
352915_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	Currently, the program s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program s policies.
352915_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	Since its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry s expectations and our needs.
352915_11_ITEM1_P60_S3	Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business.
352915_11_ITEM1_P60_S4	Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program.
352915_11_ITEM1_P60_S5	Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas.
352915_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.
352915_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	Medical Staff and Employees Our facilities had approximately 65,100 employees on December 31, 2010, of whom approximately 49,700 were employed full-time.
352915_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	Approximately 24,000 of these employees (approximately 19,300 full-time employees) are employed by the facilities acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	Typically, physicians are not employees of our hospitals and in a number of our markets may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours.
352915_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	Within our acute care division, approximately 125 physicians are employed either directly by certain of our facilities or affiliated by group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P63_S3	Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time.
352915_11_ITEM1_P63_S4	In addition, we employ approximately 250 psychiatrists within our behavioral health division.
352915_11_ITEM1_P63_S5	Each of our hospitals are managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by us.
352915_11_ITEM1_P63_S6	In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital.
352915_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	Approximately 2,100 of our employees at seven of our hospitals are unionized.
352915_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	At Valley Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating Engineers and the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ).
352915_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	Nurses and technicians at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the SEIU.
352915_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	Registered nurses at Auburn Regional Medical Center located in Washington, are represented by the United Staff Nurses Union, the technical employees are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers, and the service employees are represented by the SEIU.
352915_11_ITEM1_P64_S4	At The George Washington University Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the SEIU or the Hospital Police Association.
352915_11_ITEM1_P64_S5	Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain technicians and therapists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU.
352915_11_ITEM1_P64_S6	At Pennsylvania Clinical Schools, unionized employees are represented by the District Council 88, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees AFL-CIO.
352915_11_ITEM1_P64_S7	At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Teamsters and the Northwestern Nurses Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals.
352915_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
352915_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	The health care industry is highly competitive.
352915_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment.
352915_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes.
352915_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_11_ITEM1_P67_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us.
352915_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.
352915_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in determining a hospital s success and competitive advantage.
352915_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient s needs, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital s facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.
352915_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	In addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals.
352915_11_ITEM1_P71_S3	We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_11_ITEM1_P71_S4	Our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate.
352915_11_ITEM1_P71_S5	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_11_ITEM1_P71_S6	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	Many states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws.
352915_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states.
352915_11_ITEM1_P72_S2	In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.
352915_11_ITEM1_P72_S3	Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges.
352915_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients.
352915_11_ITEM1_P73_S3	Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience.
352915_11_ITEM1_P73_S4	The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.
352915_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	A key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets.
352915_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	The competition to acquire hospitals is significant.
352915_11_ITEM1_P74_S2	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P74_S3	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_11_ITEM1_P74_S4	We intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.
352915_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust At December 31, 2010, we held approximately 6.2% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the Trust ).
352915_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
352915_11_ITEM1_P75_S2	In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust.
352915_11_ITEM1_P75_S3	Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.
352915_11_ITEM1_P75_S4	We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $1.8 million during 2010 and $1.6 million during each of 2009 and 2008.
352915_11_ITEM1_P75_S5	Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.0 million during 2010, $1.1 million during 2009 and $900,000 during 2008 and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year.
352915_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	carrying value of this investment was $7.3 million and $8.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
352915_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	The market value of this investment was $28.8 million at December 31, 2010 and $25.2 million at December 31, 2009, based on the closing price of the Trust s stock on the respective dates.
352915_11_ITEM1_P76_S2	Total rent expense under the operating leases on the hospital facilities with the Trust was $16.2 million during 2010, $16.3 million during 2009 and $16.1 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM1_P76_S3	In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds non-controlling ownership interests.
352915_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries.
352915_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms.
352915_11_ITEM1_P77_S2	Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below.
352915_11_ITEM1_P77_S3	The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year.
352915_11_ITEM1_P77_S4	The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.
352915_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term.
352915_11_ITEM1_P78_S1	In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.
352915_11_ITEM1_P78_S2	We also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at the appraised fair market value.
352915_11_ITEM1_P78_S3	In addition, during 2006, as part of the overall exchange and substitution transaction relating to Chalmette Medical Center ( Chalmette ) which was completed during the third quarter of 2006, as well as the early five year lease renewals on Southwest Healthcare System-Inland Valley Campus ( Inland Valley ), Wellington Regional Medical Center ( Wellington ), McAllen Medical Center and The Bridgeway ( Bridgeway ), the Trust agreed to amend the Master Lease to include a change of control provision.
352915_11_ITEM1_P78_S4	The change of control provision grants us the right, upon one month s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur, to purchase any or all of the four leased hospital properties at their appraised fair market value purchase price.
352915_11_ITEM1_P78_S5	The table below details the renewal options and terms for each of our four hospital facilities leased from the Trust:
352915_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	(a) We have four 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).
352915_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	The executive officers, whose terms will expire at such time as their successors are elected, are as follows:
352915_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	Senior Vice President, President of Behavioral Health Care Division Mr. Alan B. Miller has been Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since inception and also served as President from inception until May, 2009.
352915_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	Prior thereto, he was President, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of American Medicorp, Inc.
352915_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	He currently serves as Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of Universal Health Realty Income Trust.
352915_11_ITEM1_P81_S3	Mr. Miller also serves as a Director of Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company.
352915_11_ITEM1_P81_S4	He is the father of Marc D. Miller, President and Director.
352915_11_ITEM1_P81_S5	Mr. Marc D. Miller was elected President in May, 2009 and prior thereto served as Senior Vice President and co-head of our Acute Care Hospitals since 2007.
352915_11_ITEM1_P81_S6	He was elected a Director in May, 2006 and Vice President in 2005.

352915_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also impact our business and results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	A significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in Nevada, Texas and California.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We own 6 acute care hospitals and 6 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 23% in 2010, 24% in 2009 and 24% in 2008 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P1_S3	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 15% in 2010, 14% in 2009 and 18% in 2008 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P1_S4	On a pro forma basis, assuming we had completed the acquisition of PSI on January 1, 2010, these facilities contributed 18% in 2010 of our consolidated net revenues and 10% of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P1_S5	We own 8 acute care hospitals and 14 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P1_S6	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 19% during 2010 and 20% during each of 2009 and 2008, of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	On a pro forma basis, assuming we had completed the acquisition of PSI on January 1, 2010, these facilities contributed 17% in 2010 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	and 13% of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	California: We own 4 acute care hospitals and 15 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 10% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 4% in 2010, 5% in 2009 and 7% in 2008 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	On a pro forma basis, assuming we had completed the acquisition of PSI on January 1, 2010, these facilities contributed 9% in 2010 of our consolidated net revenues and 6% of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	The significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative, regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in Nevada, Texas and California.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We derive a significant portion of our revenue from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions, the funding requirements from the federal government s stimulus package, the War on Terrorism and the relief efforts related to hurricanes and other disasters, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If the rates paid or the scope of services covered by government payors are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	On a prospective basis (including the projected revenues generated at the facilities acquired from PSI), we expect to receive a large concentration of our Medicaid revenues from Texas and significant amounts from Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, D.C., Nevada and Virginia.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These states, as well as most other states in which we operate, have reported significant budget deficits that have resulted in proposed reductions to Medicaid funding for 2011.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in these states, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors, including managed care providers, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Private payors, including managed care providers, increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P6_S6	We expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	A worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance, which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	A continuation or worsening of economic conditions may result in a continued increase in the unemployment rate which will likely increase the number of individuals without health insurance.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or a significant increase in services provided to uninsured patients.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P7_S4	These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our patient revenues and payor mix during the last few years were adversely affected by economic conditions, particularly in certain markets, such as Nevada, Texas and California, where a significant portion of our revenues are concentrated and unemployment rates remain high.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In our acute care business, we experienced net revenue pressures caused primarily by declining commercial payor utilization and an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients treated at our facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We can provide no assurance that these trends will not continue.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	During 2010, our revenues and payor mix within our acute care operations have been volatile and are unfavorable compared to the comparable prior year period, making it difficult to predict the results for 2011 or thereafter.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA ).
352915_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Reconciliation Act ), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the Legislation ), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Although it is expected that as a result of the Legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients, which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable, the Legislation makes a number of other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Legislation revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The Legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning October 1, 2011 for Medicare Part B reimbursable items and services and beginning October 1, 2012 for Medicare inpatient hospital services.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The Legislation will reduce Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in 2014, which would adversely impact the reimbursement we receive under these programs.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Legislation implements a value-based purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals may include those with excessive readmission or hospital-acquired condition rates.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The various provisions in the Legislation that directly or indirectly affect reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Legislation provisions are likely to be affected by the incomplete nature of implementing regulations or expected forthcoming interpretive guidance, gradual implementation, future legislation, and possible judicial nullification of all or certain provisions of the Legislation.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Further Legislation provisions, such as those creating the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, create certain flexibilities in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Thus, we cannot predict the impact of the Legislation on our future reimbursement at this time.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Legislation also contains provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Congress revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found guilty of violating such law.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Legislation also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited, effective immediately, from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The impact of the Legislation on each of our hospitals may vary.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Because Legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years, we anticipate that many of the provisions in the Legislation may be subject to further revision or judicial nullification.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We cannot predict the impact the Legislation may have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity, or whether we will be able to successfully adapt to the changes required by the Legislation.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In accordance with our internal policies and procedures, as well as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical treatment (whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S5	If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition, we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient s medical condition, within the facility s capability, or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital s written procedures.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our obligations under EMTALA may increase substantially going forward; CMS has recently announced its intent to issue proposed rulemaking concerning the applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S7	If the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly, or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under EMTALA is proposed and adopted, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S8	An increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Collection of receivables from third-party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and deductibles.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S11	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S12	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S13	Significant changes in business office operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P18_S14	If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals, and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a result, most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	As a result, the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals, and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	They may terminate their affiliation with us at any time.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S5	It may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals are located.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S8	We depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S9	We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S10	The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S11	This shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S12	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S13	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets, which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S14	We cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S15	If our general labor and related expenses increase, we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P22_S16	Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things: hospital billing practices and prices for services; relationships with physicians and other referral sources; adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services; ownership of facilities; qualifications of medical and support personnel; confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our facilities; operating policies and procedures, and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Among these laws are the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the federal anti-kickback statute and the provision of the Social Security Act commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These laws, and particularly the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	A number of our current arrangements, including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	CMS recently published a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol, which is intended to allow providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark law.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the Stark law, there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the Stark law or that self-disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	These laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In the future, it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws (see Item 3-Legal Proceedings ), or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P26_S6	See Item 1 Business Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation .
352915_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P27_S3	We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	All professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We believe that, based on our past experience and actuarial estimates, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	While we continuously monitor our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We may be subject to governmental investigations, regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits The federal False Claims Act permits private parties to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits against companies.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In 2009, we agreed to settle a qui tam lawsuit relating to our South Texas Health System after many years of governmental investigations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Some of our subsidiaries operating small behavioral healthcare facilities in Virginia and California are currently the subject of governmental investigations and, in two cases, a qui tam action in which the government intervened and is charging violations of the False Claims Act.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We cannot predict whether we will be the subject of additional investigations or whistleblower lawsuits.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Any determination that we have violated applicable laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P31_S5	If any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	All of our hospitals are deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P32_S3	The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P32_S5	However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest Healthcare System ( SWHCS ), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ).
352915_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in meeting all CMS conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would conduct a full Medicare certification survey.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	That survey took place the week of January 11, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from CMS that it intended to effectuate the termination of SWHCS s Medicare provider agreement effective June 1, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In May, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CMS which abated the termination action scheduled for June 1, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The agreement is one year in duration and required SWHCS to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for SWHCS to meet the Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	agreement, CMS will conduct a full certification survey to determine if SWHCS has achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	During the term of the agreement, SWHCS remains eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Also in April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from the California Department of Public Health ( CDPH ) indicating that it planned to initiate a process to revoke SWHCS s hospital license.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In May, 2010, SWHCS received the formal document related to the revocation action.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In September, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CDPH relating to the license revocation.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P36_S3	The terms of the CDPH agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with CMS.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P36_S4	As a result of the agreement, SWHCS s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the CMS full certification survey which will occur at the end of the agreement.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Pursuant to the results of the CMS full certification survey, which we anticipate occurring in mid-year, 2011, should SWHCS be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, CDPH shall deem SWHCS s license to be in good standing.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Failure of SWHCS to achieve substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, pursuant to CMS s full certification survey, will likely have a material adverse impact on SWHCS s ability to continue to operate the facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	As a result of the matters discussed above, we were not previously permitted to open newly constructed capacity at Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	However, in February, 2011, we received permission from CDPH to begin accessing the new capacity.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Unrelated to these developments, we expect a competitor to open a newly constructed acute care hospital during the first quarter of 2011.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on SWHCS s results of operations in 2011 and beyond.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center remain fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the communities they serve.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both CMS and CDPH in an effort to resolve these matters, although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Failure to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, SWHCS generated approximately 1.1% and 4.3%, respectively, of our income from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisition of PSI or realize the potential benefits of the acquisition, which could cause an adverse effect on us.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We may not be able to combine successfully the operations of PSI with our operations, and, even if such integration is accomplished, we may never realize the potential benefits of the acquisition.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The integration of PSI with our operations requires significant attention from management and may impose substantial demands on our operations or other projects.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The integration of PSI also involves a significant capital commitment, and the return that we achieve on any capital invested may be less than the return that we would achieve on our other projects or investments.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Any of these factors could cause delays or increased costs of combining PSI with us and could adversely affect our operations, financial results and liquidity.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Our level of indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of PSI could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Our level of indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of PSI could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could potentially prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In connection with the consummation of our acquisition of PSI, in addition to undertaking a $250 million offering of notes in September, 2010, we obtained a debt financing commitment of $3.45 billion under a senior credit facility consisting of an $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion term loan A facility and a $1.6 billion term loan B facility.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The senior credit facility became effective upon closing of the acquisition of PSI, which occurred in November, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We also obtained an amended $240 million accounts receivable securitization facility during 2010 (increased from $200 million).
352915_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	As of December 31, 2010, after giving effect to the use of proceeds from the various debt financing sources mentioned above, our total debt was $3.92 billion and we had $577 million of unused borrowing capacity under our senior credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities, after taking into account $71 million of outstanding letters of credit and $3 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to our short-term, on-demand note.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility, the indenture that governs the notes and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P42_S5	If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Our leverage could result in unfavorable impact on us, including the following:
352915_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our growth strategy depends, in part, on acquisitions, and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not-for-profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P43_S4	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit healthcare companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Also, suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that affect the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a healthcare facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P44_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation, increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals, increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria, any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital s results of operations, allocation of the purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire, which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S3	We may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S5	In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by acquired hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S6	In addition, some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S7	If we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire, operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals, our results of operations could be harmed.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S8	If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S9	Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S10	Although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S11	Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility s reputation could harm our business.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S12	Our subsidiary, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P45_S13	Our subsidiary, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions (see Item 3-Legal Proceedings ).
352915_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted Certificates of Need, or CON, laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization review, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Fluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S2	If we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future, the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S3	In addition to our operating results, many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S4	These factors include certain of the risks discussed herein, demographic changes, operating results of other hospital companies, changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts, speculation in the press or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, managed care contract negotiations and terminations, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S5	We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S6	As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S7	While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S8	For example, we cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S9	We also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S10	If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S11	If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S12	Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S13	Generally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S14	Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P50_S15	Differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	In addition, we have a commitment with an unrelated third party to build a newly constructed facility with a specified minimum number of beds and services.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P52_S4	The deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P52_S5	We require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P52_S6	We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P52_S7	We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	To fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P54_S3	We depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P54_S4	The expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P54_S5	The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities, which could harm our business.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	At December 31, 2010, 23,588,743 shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P55_S3	To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In addition, from time-to-time our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Conversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The right to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P57_S2	As of March 31, 2010, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 7.5% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect six members of the Board of Directors and constituted 87.3% of our general voting power.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P57_S3	As of March 31, 2010, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options) constituted 92.5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 12.7% of our general voting power.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P57_S4	As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P57_S5	Each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).
352915_11_ITEM1A_P57_S6	In the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock, which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P57_S7	The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P57_S8	Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his family who are also directors and officers of our company, and they can elect a majority of our company s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.
352915_11_ITEM1A_P57_S9	In addition, because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.

352915_11_ITEM2_P12_S0	(12) We plan to divest these facilities pursuant to our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM2_P13_S0	We own or lease medical office buildings adjoining some of our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM2_P13_S1	We believe that the leases on the facilities, medical office buildings and other real estate leased or owned by us do not impose any material limitation on our operations.
352915_11_ITEM2_P13_S2	The aggregate lease payments on facilities leased by us were $45 million in 2010, $41 million in 2009 and $41 million in 2008.
352915_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) issued a series of subpoenas seeking documents related to the treatment of Medicaid beneficiaries at two of our facilities, Marion Youth Center and Mountain Youth Academy,.
352915_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	It was our understanding at that time that the OIG was investigating whether claims for reimbursement submitted by those facilities to the Virginia Medicaid program were supported by adequate documentation of the services provided which could be considered to be a basis for a false claims act violation.
352915_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	In August, 2008, the Office of the Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Virginia issued a subpoena to Keystone Newport News, another of our facilities.
352915_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	It was our understanding at that time that the Office of Attorney General was investigating whether Keystone Newport News complied with various Virginia laws and regulations, including documentation requirements.
352915_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	In response to these subpoenas, we produced the requested documents on a rolling basis and we cooperated with the investigations in all respects.
352915_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	We also met with representatives of the OIG, the Virginia Attorney General, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, and the United States Department of Justice Civil Division on several occasions to discuss a possible resolution of this matter.
352915_11_ITEM3_P1_S4	However, the parties were not able to reach a resolution.
352915_11_ITEM3_P1_S5	Consequently, in November, 2009, the United States Department of Justice and the Virginia Attorney General intervened in a qui tam case that had been filed by former employees of Marion Youth Center under seal in 2007 against Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ), and Keystone Marion, LLC and Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC ( Keystone ).
352915_11_ITEM3_P1_S6	The Department of Justice and the Commonwealth of Virginia filed and served their complaint which, at present, relates solely to the Marion Youth Center.
352915_11_ITEM3_P1_S7	The complaint originally alleged causes of action pursuant to the federal and state false claims acts, the Virginia fraud statute, and unjust enrichment.
352915_11_ITEM3_P1_S8	The former employees filed a separate amended complaint, alleging employment and retaliation claims as well as false claim act violations.
352915_11_ITEM3_P1_S9	In April, 2010, the defendants in the lawsuit filed motions to dismiss the claims filed by the government and the former employees.
352915_11_ITEM3_P1_S10	In July, 2010, the court ruled on the motions, granting them in part and denying them in part.
352915_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	The court has allowed the government to proceed with its claims under the federal and state false claims act and the Virginia fraud statute.
352915_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	In addition, the court has allowed the former employees to proceed with parts of their employment related and retaliation claims.
352915_11_ITEM3_P2_S2	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
352915_11_ITEM3_P2_S3	We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously against the government s and the former employees allegations.
352915_11_ITEM3_P2_S4	There can be no assurance that we will prevail in the litigation or that the case will be limited to the Marion Youth Center.
352915_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	v. Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC: Alicante School in California was acquired by a subsidiary of ours in October, 2005.
352915_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	Prior to our acquisition, two former employees of the facility filed a false claim act qui tam action and a gender discrimination/whistleblower claim in Sacramento County Superior Court.
352915_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	The plaintiffs allege that the Alicante School improperly billed subdivisions of the state of California based upon services provided at the school and that the plaintiffs were discriminated against based upon their gender and as a result of their objection to these practices.
352915_11_ITEM3_P3_S3	In June, 2008, we entered into an agreement with the former owners of the facility whereby they agreed to defend the case, indemnify us and hold us harmless for any damages that may result from this case.
352915_11_ITEM3_P3_S4	The former owners of the facility had been funding the legal defense of this case since that time.
352915_11_ITEM3_P3_S5	Recently, the court approved the agreed upon $9.5 million settlement of this matter which we paid to the plaintiffs in January, 2011.
352915_11_ITEM3_P3_S6	Since we have made a demand on the former owners of the facility for repayment, and intend to pursue collection of the $9.5 million pursuant to the June, 2008 indemnification agreement (although we can provide no assurance that we will collect the entire $9.5 million), the settlement amount and related receivable is reflected in other current assets and other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	Martin v. UHS of Delaware: UHS of Delaware, Inc., a subsidiary, and one of our non-public schools in California operated by one of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a state False Claim Act case in Sacramento County Superior Court.
352915_11_ITEM3_P4_S1	Plaintiffs are a former student and employees of the Elmira School who claim that the UHS Schools in California unlawfully retained public education funding from the state of California for the operation of these schools but failed to meet state requirements to qualify as a non-public school.
352915_11_ITEM3_P4_S2	Plaintiffs have also claimed that we committed unfair business practices associated with these allegations.
352915_11_ITEM3_P4_S3	We deny liability and intend to defend this case vigorously.
352915_11_ITEM3_P4_S4	We are presently uncertain as to the legal viability of the claims and are unable to determine the extent of potential financial exposure, if any, at this time.
352915_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	Wage and Hour Class Actions: Ethridge v. Universal Health Services et.
352915_11_ITEM3_P5_S1	al: In June, 2008, we and one of our acute care facilities, Lancaster Community Hospital, were named as defendants in a wage and hour lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
352915_11_ITEM3_P5_S2	This is a purported class action lawsuit alleging that the hospital failed to provide sufficient meal and break periods to certain employees.
352915_11_ITEM3_P5_S3	In June, 2010 a settlement was reached with the attorneys for the class representative.
352915_11_ITEM3_P5_S4	The settlement was recently approved by the court.
352915_11_ITEM3_P5_S5	The reserve established for the settlement of this matter did not have a material impact on our 2010 consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM3_P5_S6	Other: We and/or our subsidiaries are presently involved in three other wage and hour class action cases in California and Tennessee.
352915_11_ITEM3_P5_S7	Two of those cases have been certified as a class by the California State Superior Court in Alameda County and the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, respectively.
352915_11_ITEM3_P5_S8	At present, we are uncertain as to the extent of potential financial exposure but do not believe potential settlements or judgments in these cases will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM3_P6_S0	Department of Justice ICD Investigation: In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICDs ) from 2003 to the present at several of our acute care facilities.
352915_11_ITEM3_P6_S1	The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Claims Determination regarding these devices.
352915_11_ITEM3_P6_S2	At present, we are uncertain as to the extent of the claims, liability for such claims and potential financial exposure in connection with this matter.
352915_11_ITEM3_P7_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse.
352915_11_ITEM3_P7_S1	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
352915_11_ITEM3_P7_S2	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_11_ITEM3_P8_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_11_ITEM3_P9_S0	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein.
352915_11_ITEM3_P9_S1	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_11_ITEM3_P10_S0	Southwest Healthcare System: During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest Healthcare System ( SWHCS ), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ).
352915_11_ITEM3_P10_S1	The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in meeting all CMS conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM3_P10_S2	Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would conduct a full Medicare certification survey.
352915_11_ITEM3_P10_S3	That survey took place the week of January 11, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM3_P11_S0	In April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from CMS that it intended to effectuate the termination of SWHCS s Medicare provider agreement effective June 1, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM3_P11_S1	In May, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CMS which abated the termination action scheduled for June 1, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM3_P11_S2	The agreement is one year in duration and required SWHCS to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for SWHCS to meet the Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM3_P11_S3	At the conclusion of the agreement, CMS will conduct a full certification survey to determine if SWHCS has achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM3_P11_S4	During the term of the agreement, SWHCS remains eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.
352915_11_ITEM3_P12_S0	Also in April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from the California Department of Public Health ( CDPH ) indicating that it planned to initiate a process to revoke SWHCS s hospital license.
352915_11_ITEM3_P12_S1	In May, 2010, SWHCS received the formal document related to the revocation action.
352915_11_ITEM3_P12_S2	In September, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CDPH relating to the license revocation.
352915_11_ITEM3_P12_S3	The terms of the CDPH agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with CMS.
352915_11_ITEM3_P12_S4	As a result of the agreement, SWHCS s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the CMS full certification survey which will occur at the end of the agreement.
352915_11_ITEM3_P13_S0	Pursuant to the results of the CMS full certification survey, which we anticipate occurring in mid-year, 2011, should SWHCS be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, CDPH shall deem SWHCS s license to be in good standing.
352915_11_ITEM3_P13_S1	Failure of SWHCS to achieve substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, pursuant to CMS s full certification survey, will likely have a material adverse impact on SWHCS s ability to continue to operate the facilities.
352915_11_ITEM3_P14_S0	As a result of the matters discussed above, we were not previously permitted to open newly constructed capacity at Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center.
352915_11_ITEM3_P14_S1	However, in February, 2011, we received permission from CDPH to begin accessing the new capacity.
352915_11_ITEM3_P14_S2	Unrelated to these developments, we expect a competitor to open a newly constructed acute care hospital during the first quarter of 2011.
352915_11_ITEM3_P14_S3	We are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on SWHCS s results of operations in 2011 and beyond.
352915_11_ITEM3_P15_S0	Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center remain fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the communities they serve.
352915_11_ITEM3_P15_S1	We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both CMS and CDPH in an effort to resolve these matters, although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so.
352915_11_ITEM3_P15_S2	Failure to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_11_ITEM3_P16_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, SWHCS generated approximately 1.1% and 4.3%, respectively, of our income from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_11_ITEM3_P17_S0	The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition of PSI which was completed in November, 2010: Garden City Employees Retirement System v. PSI: This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws.
352915_11_ITEM3_P17_S1	We are uncertain at this time as to potential liability and damages but intend to defend the case vigorously.
352915_11_ITEM3_P18_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Sierra Vista: In 2009, Sierra Vista Hospital in Sacramento, California learned of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) relating to Medicare services provided by the facility.
352915_11_ITEM3_P18_S1	The DOJ ultimately notified the facility that with respect to partial hospitalization and outpatient services, the DOJ believed that the medical record documentation did not adequately support the claims submitted for reimbursement by Medicare.
352915_11_ITEM3_P18_S2	We recently reached a tentative financial settlement with the DOJ.
352915_11_ITEM3_P18_S3	The reserve established in connection with this matter did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM3_P18_S4	As part of that agreement, the facility will be subject to a corporate integrity agreement, the terms of which have not yet been finalized.
352915_11_ITEM3_P19_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_11_ITEM3_P20_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_11_ITEM3_P20_S1	The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_11_ITEM3_P20_S2	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_11_ITEM3_P21_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_11_ITEM3_P21_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_11_ITEM3_P21_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ and we continue to cooperate with the DOJ with respect to this investigation.
352915_11_ITEM3_P21_S3	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_11_ITEM3_P22_S0	Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims: The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services ( DMAS ) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state s Medicaid Provider Services Manual ( Manual ).
352915_11_ITEM3_P22_S1	As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities.
352915_11_ITEM3_P22_S2	PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending.
352915_11_ITEM3_P22_S3	Currently, and from time to time, some of our other facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_11_ITEM3_P23_S0	participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_11_ITEM3_P23_S1	We do not believe that, other than as described above, any such existing action would materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM3_P23_S2	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_11_ITEM3_P23_S3	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

352915_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	Shares of our Class A, Class C and Class D Common Stock are not traded in any public market, but are each convertible into shares of our Class B Common Stock on a share-for-share basis.
352915_11_ITEM5_P0_S2	In November, 2009, we declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend which was paid on December 15, 2009 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2009.

352915_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	As of February 28, 2011, we owned and/or operated 25 acute care hospitals and 206 behavioral health centers located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 7 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 5 states and Puerto Rico.
352915_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	In November, 2010, we completed the acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ).
352915_11_ITEM7_P0_S4	PSI was formerly the largest operator of freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities operating a total of 105 inpatient and outpatient facilities in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_11_ITEM7_P0_S5	Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 70% of our consolidated net revenues in 2010 and 74% in each of 2009 and 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P0_S6	Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 30% of our consolidated net revenues during 2010 and 25% during each of 2009 and 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P0_S7	The net revenues generated at the facilities acquired from PSI on November 15, 2010 are included from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM7_P0_S8	Approximately 1% of our consolidated net revenues in each of 2009 and 2008 were recorded in connection with two construction management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we built newly constructed acute care hospitals for an unrelated third party.
352915_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.
352915_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
352915_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities.
352915_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, and statements of our goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.
352915_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Words such as may, will, should, could, would, predicts, potential, continue, expects, anticipates, future, intends, plans, believes, estimates, appears, projects and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.
352915_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved.
352915_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.
352915_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	Such factors include, among other things, the following:
352915_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level.
352915_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us, including matters as disclosed in Item 3.
352915_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria .
352915_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	Our acute care facilities are scheduled to implement an EHR application, on a facility-by-facility basis, beginning in 2011 and ending in 2014, however, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and, should we qualify, we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amounts is dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility.
352915_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	Should we qualify for incentive payments, there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the EHR application which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
352915_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Southwest Healthcare System: During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest Healthcare System ( SWHCS ), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ).
352915_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in meeting all CMS conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would conduct a full Medicare certification survey.
352915_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	That survey took place the week of January 11, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	In April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from CMS that it intended to effectuate the termination of SWHCS s Medicare provider agreement effective June 1, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	In May, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CMS which abated the termination action scheduled for June 1, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	The agreement is one year in duration and required SWHCS to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for SWHCS to meet the Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	At the conclusion of the agreement, CMS will conduct a full certification survey to determine if SWHCS has achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	During the term of the agreement, SWHCS remains eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.
352915_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Also in April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from the California Department of Public Health ( CDPH ) indicating that it planned to initiate a process to revoke SWHCS s hospital license.
352915_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	In May, 2010, SWHCS received the formal document related to the revocation action.
352915_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	In September, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CDPH relating to the license revocation.
352915_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	The terms of the CDPH agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with CMS.
352915_11_ITEM7_P12_S4	As a result of the agreement, SWHCS s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the CMS full certification survey which will occur at the end of the agreement.
352915_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Pursuant to the results of the CMS full certification survey, which we anticipate occurring in mid-year, 2011, should SWHCS be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, CDPH shall deem SWHCS s license to be in good standing.
352915_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Failure of SWHCS to achieve substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, pursuant to CMS s full certification survey, will likely have a material adverse impact on SWHCS s ability to continue to operate the facilities.
352915_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	As a result of the matters discussed above, we were not previously permitted to open newly constructed capacity at Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center.
352915_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	However, in February, 2011, we received permission from CDPH to begin accessing the new capacity.
352915_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Unrelated to these developments, we expect a competitor to open a newly constructed acute care hospital during the first quarter of 2011.
352915_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	We are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on SWHCS s results of operations in 2011 and beyond.
352915_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center remain fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the communities they serve.
352915_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both CMS and CDPH in an effort to resolve these matters, although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so.
352915_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	Failure to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, SWHCS generated approximately 1.1% and 4.3%, respectively, of our income from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Given these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
352915_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements.
352915_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made.
352915_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law.
352915_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
352915_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
352915_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in Note 1 to the financial statements.
352915_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following: Revenue recognition: We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 38% of our net patient revenues during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 46% of our net patient revenues during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P19_S5	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_11_ITEM7_P19_S6	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_11_ITEM7_P19_S7	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_11_ITEM7_P19_S8	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_11_ITEM7_P19_S9	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_11_ITEM7_P19_S10	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
352915_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of December 31, 2010, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.
352915_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $807 million, $671 million and $609 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
352915_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	At our acute care facilities, Medicaid pending accounts comprise the large majority of our receivables that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states.
352915_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	Approximately 4% or $33 million as of December 31, 2010 and 6% or $35 million as of December 31, 2009 of our accounts receivable, net, were comprised of Medicaid pending accounts.
352915_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration.
352915_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned.
352915_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered.
352915_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible.
352915_11_ITEM7_P24_S4	When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending our patient accounting system records net revenues for the services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patient s Medicaid eligibility.
352915_11_ITEM7_P24_S5	Based on historical hindsight information related to Medicaid pending accounts, we estimate that approximately 56% or $18 million of the $33 million Medicaid pending accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010 will subsequently qualify for Medicaid reimbursement.
352915_11_ITEM7_P24_S6	Approximately 56% or $20 million of $35 million total Medicaid pending accounts receivable as of December 31, 2009 subsequently qualified for Medicaid pending reimbursement and were therefore appropriately classified at the patient s registration.
352915_11_ITEM7_P24_S7	Additional charity reserves of $15 million during 2010 and $16 million during 2009 were established to cover the Medicaid Pending patients that failed to qualify for the Medicaid program based on historical conversion rates.
352915_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Based on general factors as discussed below in Provision for Doubtful Accounts , our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
352915_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Such estimated uncollectible amounts related to Medicaid pending, as well as other accounts receivable payer classifications, are considered when the overall individual facility and company-wide reserves are developed.
352915_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Below are the Medicaid pending receivable agings as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in thousands): Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_11_ITEM7_P26_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_11_ITEM7_P26_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient is sent a series of statements and collection letters.
352915_11_ITEM7_P26_S6	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_11_ITEM7_P26_S7	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_11_ITEM7_P26_S8	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of $99 million as of December 31, 2010 and $61 million as of December 31, 2009.
352915_11_ITEM7_P26_S9	Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of at least 20% of total charges.
352915_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	During the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay balances outstanding for greater than 60 days from the date of discharge.
352915_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	All self-pay accounts at the hospital level are fully reserved if they have been outstanding for greater than 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.
352915_11_ITEM7_P27_S4	On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience.
352915_11_ITEM7_P27_S5	At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $249 million and $169 million, respectively.
352915_11_ITEM7_P27_S6	Approximately 93% during 2010, 94% during 2009 and 93% during 2008, of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our acute care hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM7_P27_S7	Shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:
352915_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Self-Insured Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P28_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_11_ITEM7_P28_S5	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Professional and General Liability Claims Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence (as compared to $20 million per occurrence prior to 2008).
352915_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Prior to our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	Prior to our acquisition in November, 2010, the PSI facilities were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a $3 million self-insured retention to a limit of $75 million.
352915_11_ITEM7_P29_S4	PSI utilized its captive insurance company to manage the self-insured retention and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of PSI.
352915_11_ITEM7_P29_S5	Since our acquisition of PSI on November 15, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries (which are not former PSI subsidiaries) are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence.
352915_11_ITEM7_P29_S6	Effective November, 2010, our subsidiaries (including the former PSI subsidiaries) were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P29_S7	We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P29_S8	Upon our acquisition of PSI, we conducted a thorough analysis of PSI s claims and related reserves and, with the assistance of an independent third-party actuary, we determined that the aggregate self-insured retention estimate for the pre-acquisition professional and general liability claims amounted to $51 million which is included in our total accrual as of December 31, 2010, as discussed below.
352915_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims, including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from PSI, was $289 million, of which $60 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2009, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $266 million, of which $46 million is included in other current liabilities.
352915_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	Based upon the results of reserve analyses, we recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $49 million during 2010 and $23 million during 2009.
352915_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	These favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments were due to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 75% from 50%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 25% from 50%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years.
352915_11_ITEM7_P30_S4	As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends.
352915_11_ITEM7_P30_S5	Actuarially determined estimates for our 2011 provision for self-insured professional and general liability claims were developed based upon similar metrics and weighting.
352915_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	For the years of 1998 through 2001, most of our subsidiaries were covered under commercial insurance policies with PHICO, a Pennsylvania based insurance company that was placed into liquidation in February, 2002.
352915_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	As a result, although PHICO continued to be liable for claims on our behalf that were related to 1998 through 2001, we began paying the claims upon PHICO s liquidation.
352915_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	Since that time, although we preserved our right to receive reimbursement from the PHICO estate, we were not previously able to assess the probability of collection or reasonably quantify our share of the liquidation proceeds.
352915_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	In January, 2009, a court order from the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania was executed in connection with the partial liquidation of the PHICO estate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, based upon our share of the undisputed and resolved claims made against the PHICO estate as of a specified date and as approved by the liquidator to the court, we recorded a $10 million reduction to our professional and general liability self-insured claims expense.
352915_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	These liquidation proceeds were received during the first quarter of 2009.
352915_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Based upon the results of workers compensation reserves analyses, we recorded reductions to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims amounting to $4 million during 2010, $7 million during 2009 and $4 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for self-insured general and professional and workers compensation claims, given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves as discussed above, it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves.
352915_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and workers compensation reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2010 (amount in thousands):
352915_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	(a) Excludes the impact of the $10 million recovery from the liquidation of the PHICO estate, as discussed above.
352915_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	(b) General and professional liability amounts for 2009 and 2010 are net of adjustments recoded during each year relating to prior years, as discussed above.
352915_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	In addition, we also maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	The ultimate costs related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	We have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to $250,000 deductible.
352915_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses.).
352915_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented fault zones.
352915_11_ITEM7_P38_S4	Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_11_ITEM7_P38_S5	The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million.
352915_11_ITEM7_P38_S6	Flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.
352915_11_ITEM7_P38_S7	Behavioral health care facilities acquired in November, 2010 The newly acquired facilities formerly owned by PSI have all risk property coverage with a loss limit of $100 million with a $25,000 deductible.
352915_11_ITEM7_P38_S8	Earth movement losses, except California, are subject to an annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million with a $50,000 per occurrence deductible.
352915_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	is further sub-limited to an annual aggregate loss limit of $50 million with a deductible of 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Named windstorms are insured to $100 million per occurrence but are potentially subject to applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	Flood losses are subject to an annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million with deductibles ranging from $50,000 to $100,000.
352915_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	Flood losses that occur in designated high hazard areas are sub-limited to $25 million with a $500,000 deductible.
352915_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years, the cost of commercial property insurance has increased.
352915_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	As a result, catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Goodwill: Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	We have designated September 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2010 which indicated no impairment of goodwill.
352915_11_ITEM7_P42_S3	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill.
352915_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.

352915_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $47 million to $428 million during 2010 as compared to $475 million during 2009 due to the following:
352915_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	a net decrease of $17 million from other combined net unfavorable changes consisting of: (i) a $9 million decrease resulting from the charge incurred during 2010 in connection with the previously disclosed split-dollar life insurance agreements entered into during 2010 on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife; (ii) a $7 million decrease resulting from the charge recorded during 2010 to write-off certain costs related to an acute care hospital construction project; (iii) a $7 million decrease resulting from a reduction to our workers compensation self insurance reserves recorded during 2009 that related to years prior to 2009, and; (iv) a net increase of $6 million from other combined net favorable changes.
352915_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Net income attributable to UHS decreased $30 million to $230 million during 2010 as compared to $260 million during 2009 due to the following:

352915_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	an unfavorable change of $7 million resulting primarily from the after-tax gain realized during 2008 on the sale of an acute care hospital.
352915_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Acute Care Hospital Services Year Ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009:
352915_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands): On a same facility basis during 2010, as compared to 2009, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $91 million or 2%.
352915_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $33 million or 9% to $328 million or 8.4% of net revenues during 2010 as compared to $361 million or 9.5% of net revenues during 2009.

352915_11_ITEM7_P58_S6	The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 59% during 2010 and 62% during 2009.
352915_11_ITEM7_P58_S7	On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 1.0% during 2010, as compared to 2009, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.7% during 2010, as compared to 2009.
352915_11_ITEM7_P58_S8	The decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes at our acute care hospitals during 2010, as compared to 2009, was due primarily to net revenue pressures experienced throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM7_P58_S9	The revenue pressures were caused primarily by declining commercial payor utilization and an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients treated at our facilities.
352915_11_ITEM7_P58_S10	Our acute care facilities located in Texas were also unfavorably impacted by reductions in Medicaid revenues.
352915_11_ITEM7_P58_S11	Also contributing to the decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes at our acute care facilities were increases in salaries, wages and benefits expense and supplies expense which increased beyond the rate of increase of our acute care revenues.
352915_11_ITEM7_P58_S12	We continue to experience an increase in uninsured patients throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals which in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance.
352915_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $807 million during 2010 and $671 million during 2009.
352915_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided, could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2010 and 2009.
352915_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	Included in these results, in addition to the same facility results shown above, is: (i) the favorable effect of $42 million recorded during 2010 and $20 million recorded during 2009 resulting from reductions to our professional and general liability self insurance reserves, as discussed above in Self-Insured Risks ; (ii) the unfavorable effect of $7 million recorded during 2010 to write-off certain costs related to an acute care hospital construction project, and; (iii) the favorable effect of $5 million recorded during 2009 resulting from a reduction to our workers compensation self insurance reserves (amounts in thousands): During 2010, as compared to 2009, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased 2% or $91 million to $3.90 billion due to an increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above.

352915_11_ITEM7_P64_S9	In addition to the increase in net revenues, the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes generated by our acute care facilities during 2009, as compared to 2008, was due primarily to, as a percentage of net revenues:
352915_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	a decrease in other operating expenses (to 18.0% during 2009 as compared to 18.6% during 2008) due primarily to cost-reducing initiatives undertaken at our facilities as well as the impact of the disinflationary economy which has limited our vendors and service providers ability to increase their prices.
352915_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $671 million during 2009 and $609 million during 2008.

352915_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	Included in these results, in addition to the same facility results shown above, is: (i) the favorable effect of $26 million recorded during 2009 resulting from the reduction to our professional and general liability and workers compensation self insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009, as discussed above in Self-Insured Risks, and; (ii) the unfavorable effect resulting from the $25 million provision for settlement recorded during 2008 to establish a reserve in connection with the government s investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates which was settled during 2009 (amounts in thousands):
352915_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	During 2009, as compared to 2008, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased 4% or $141 million to $3.81 billion.
352915_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	The increase in net revenues was attributable to:

352915_11_ITEM7_P72_S7	On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 1.9% during 2009, as compared to 2008, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.0% during 2009, as compared to 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our behavioral health care facilities for 2009 and 2008, including newly acquired or recently opened facilities (amounts in thousands): During 2009, as compared to 2008, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities (including newly acquired and recently opened facilities), increased 5% or $64 million to $1.32 billion during 2009 as compared to $1.25 billion during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The increase in net revenues was attributable to:
352915_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	a $16 million net increase resulting primarily from revenues generated at facilities recently acquired or opened.
352915_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $37 million or 15% to $282 million or 21.4% of net revenues during 2009, as compared to $245 million or 19.5% of net revenues during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	The increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to:
352915_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	an increase of $4 million resulting from the reduction recorded during 2009 to our professional and general liability and workers compensation self-insurance reserves relating to years prior to 2009, as discussed above in Self-Insured Risk.
352915_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Sources of Revenue Overview: We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services.
352915_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital.
352915_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.
352915_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis.
352915_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.
352915_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage.
352915_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year.
352915_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue.
352915_11_ITEM7_P79_S3	Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payors and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self-pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided.
352915_11_ITEM7_P79_S4	Since a significant portion of our revenues are derived from facilities located in Nevada, Texas and California, we are particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in those states.
352915_11_ITEM7_P79_S5	Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
352915_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	The following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years (excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements) for: (i) our Acute Care and Behavioral Health Care Facilities Combined; (ii) our Acute Care Facilities, and; (iii) our Behavioral Health Care Facilities.
352915_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.
352915_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease.
352915_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_11_ITEM7_P81_S3	Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.
352915_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ).
352915_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge.
352915_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s Medicare severity diagnosis related group ( MS-DRG ).
352915_11_ITEM7_P82_S3	Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis.
352915_11_ITEM7_P82_S4	The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care.
352915_11_ITEM7_P82_S5	This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG.
352915_11_ITEM7_P82_S6	The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity.
352915_11_ITEM7_P82_S7	While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patient s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.
352915_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1.
352915_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the hospital market basket index, gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services.
352915_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM7_P83_S3	In July, 2009, CMS published the final IPPS 2010 payment rule which provided for a 2.1% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P83_S4	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments were considered, our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2010 rule was approximately 1.1%.
352915_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	In July, 2010, CMS published its final IPPS 2011 payment rule which provided for a 2.6% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall decrease from the proposed federal fiscal year 2011 rule will approximate 1.1%.
352915_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011.
352915_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	In September, 2007, the TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007 legislation took effect and scaled back cuts in hospital reimbursement that CMS was set to impose.
352915_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	2010 to 2012, the new law requires CMS to make adjustments to the Medicare standardized amounts in these years to reflect the removal of actual aggregate payment increases or decreases for documentation and coding adjustments that occurred during federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 as compared to the initial CMS estimates.
352915_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	In federal fiscal year 2010, CMS made its initial statutory mandated adjustment under this legislation and will continue to do so in subsequent fiscal years to ensure the implementation of MS-DRGs was budget neutral among all affected hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	In July, 2010, the IPPS 2011 proposed payment rule applied a 2.9% reduction to the 2011 market basket update and indicated another 2.9% reduction would also be applied in 2012 for documenting and coding.
352915_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	In this same rule, CMS indicated a remaining documenting and coding adjustment of 3.9% reduction is still required to be made to future IPPS updates.
352915_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	CMS did not indicate to which future federal fiscal year(s) this reduction would be applied.
352915_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	On January 1, 2005, CMS implemented a new Psychiatric Prospective Payment System ( Psych PPS ) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program.
352915_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	This system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics.
352915_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department.
352915_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	According to the May, 2009 CMS notice, the market basket increase was 2.1% for the period of July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	According to the April, 2010 CMS notice, the market basket increase is 2.4% for the period of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011.
352915_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	In January, 2011 CMS published its proposed Psych PPS rule for the fifteen month period July 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012.
352915_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	The market basket increase for this time period is scheduled to be 2.75%, which includes a 0.25% reduction required by the federal Health Care Reform legislation enacted in 2010.
352915_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	In October 2009, CMS published its annual final Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System ( OPPS ) rule for 2010.
352915_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	The final market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.1%.
352915_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	When other statutorily required adjustments are considered the overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2010 is estimated to be 1.9%.
352915_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	In November 2010, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2011.
352915_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	The final market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.46%.
352915_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011.
352915_11_ITEM7_P92_S3	When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, the overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2011 is estimated to be 3.2%.
352915_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria.
352915_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary and we are unable to predict which states will chose to participate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P94_S3	We estimate that approximately 75% of the projected incentive payments will be paid by Medicare and 25% from state Medicaid programs.
352915_11_ITEM7_P94_S4	Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria .
352915_11_ITEM7_P94_S5	These Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments are intended to offset a portion of the cost incurred to qualify as a meaningful user of EHR.
352915_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Our acute care facilities are scheduled to implement an EHR application, on a facility-by-facility basis, beginning in 2011 and ending in 2013.
352915_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	However, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and, should we qualify, we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amount is dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility.
352915_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	the EHR application which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S2	Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S3	In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S5	We receive a large concentration of our Medicaid revenues from Texas and significant amounts from Nevada, Florida, California, Washington, D.C. and Illinois.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S6	The majority of these states, as well as most other states in which we operate, have reported significant budget deficits that have resulted in the reduction of Medicaid funding for 2009 and 2010.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S7	Furthermore, many states are currently working to effectuate further significant reductions in the level of Medicaid funding due to significant state budget deficits also projected for 2011, which could adversely affect future levels of Medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S8	We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S9	Conversely, on February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was signed into law and contained various Medicaid provisions that will impact our hospitals including the following: (i) temporary increases to Medicaid funding through enhanced federal matching assistance percentages ( FMAPs ) for a 27 month period retroactive to October 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 with all states receiving a FMAP increase of 6.2% and also receiving a bonus FMAP increase contingent on the increased level of a state s unemployment rate; (ii) a temporary increase of 2.5% in the federal Medicaid disproportionate share hospital allotment for both federal fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and; (iii) states will be required to maintain effort on Medicaid eligibility consistent with requirements prior to passage of this law.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S10	In August, 2010, H.R. 1586 was enacted into law and extended the enhanced FMAPs until June 30, 2011, but at a reduced rate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S11	The FMAP increase will be 3.2% during the first quarter of 2011 and 1.2% during the second quarter.
352915_11_ITEM7_P97_S12	Due to the indirect nature of the enhanced Medicaid federal funding contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and H.R. 1586, we are unable to determine the impact of these Medicaid changes on our future results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hildalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in CMS-approved private Medicaid supplemental payment ( UPL ) programs.
352915_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties.
352915_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	Our hospitals receive both UPL payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM7_P98_S3	The UPL payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer ( IGT ) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM7_P98_S4	We received $38 million during 2010, $48 million during 2009 and $30 million during 2008, of aggregate, net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care payments.
352915_11_ITEM7_P98_S5	If during 2011 the hospital district makes IGTs consistent with 2010, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate, net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care payment revenues of approximately $35 million during 2011.
352915_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	In July 2009, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission ( THHSC ) issued a final rule and will rebase during state fiscal year ( SFY ) 2010, on a statewide budget neutral basis, all acute care hospital inpatient Standard Dollar Amount ( SDA ) rates.
352915_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	In addition, the THHSC will also rebase all MS-DRG relative weights concurrent with this SDA rate change.
352915_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	weight rebasing and will only make changes on a prospective basis regardless of when the rebased SDA rates and relative weights are implemented.
352915_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	The THHSC recently notified hospitals of their rebased SFY2011 SDA rates, preliminary statewide MS-DRG relative weights for SFY2011 and the estimated statewide budget neutrality adjustment.
352915_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	In addition, in October, 2010, THHSC finalized a rule whereby: (i) the period November 1, 2010 to August 31, 2011 will be considered a transition period to fully rebased SDA rates, and; (ii) fully rebased SDA rates will then become effective September 1, 2011.
352915_11_ITEM7_P100_S3	We estimate that the November 1, 2010 rate changes will not have a material impact on our inpatient Medicaid reimbursement.
352915_11_ITEM7_P100_S4	In addition, we estimate the September 1, 2011 SDA rate changes could potentially reduce our inpatient Medicaid reimbursement by up to $5 million annually.
352915_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	The THHSC has indicated an intention to expand state Medicaid managed care programs in future state fiscal years starting in the state s 2012 fiscal year.
352915_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	Although we are unable to determine the impact of the managed care expansion on future Medicaid reimbursement or its impact on Medicaid UPL payments, depending on the actual structure of the actual managed care expansion, this change could have a material adverse impact on our Medicaid UPL payments.
352915_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs.
352915_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow.
352915_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P102_S3	Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.
352915_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance.
352915_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy.
352915_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.
352915_11_ITEM7_P103_S3	Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services.
352915_11_ITEM7_P103_S4	To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage.
352915_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy.
352915_11_ITEM7_P104_S2	Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.
352915_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	State Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital ( DSH ) adjustment.
352915_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments.
352915_11_ITEM7_P105_S2	Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.
352915_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	additional reimbursement from each state s DSH fund.
352915_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	The Texas and South Carolina programs have been renewed for each state s 2011 fiscal years (covering the period of October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011 for each state).
352915_11_ITEM7_P106_S2	In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $54 million during 2010, $56 million during 2009 and $42 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P106_S3	Failure to renew these DSH programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of our hospitals that currently receive DSH payments to qualify for future DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. .
352915_11_ITEM7_P106_S4	Assuming that the Texas and South Carolina programs are renewed for each state s 2012 fiscal years at amounts similar to the 2011 fiscal year amounts, we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be $47 million during 2011.
352915_11_ITEM7_P106_S5	Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:
352915_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, the War on Terrorism, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, the expansion of a Medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future.
352915_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.
352915_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the Reconciliation Act ) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the Affordable Care Act ), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs.
352915_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.
352915_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	Immediate Medicare Reductions: The Reconciliation Act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities in each of 2010 and 2011 by 0.25%.
352915_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	Further, the Affordable Care Act implements certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.
352915_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	Future Medicare Reductions: Future changes to the Medicare program include:
352915_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Although we do not believe the above-mentioned Medicare market basket reductions implemented in 2010 will have a material impact on our results of operations, we are unable to estimate the future impact of the other legislative changes as outlined above.
352915_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities.
352915_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions.
352915_11_ITEM7_P111_S3	We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments.
352915_11_ITEM7_P111_S4	Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.
352915_11_ITEM7_P111_S5	Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_11_ITEM7_P111_S6	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM7_P111_S7	Other Operating Results Combined net revenues from our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers were $17 million during 2010, $24 million during 2009 and $29 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P111_S8	In connection with construction management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we are building/have built newly constructed acute care hospitals for an unrelated third party, we earned revenues of $3 million during 2010, $42 million during 2009 and $64 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P111_S9	Combined income from continuing operations before income taxes earned in connection with the revenues mentioned above was $5 million during 2010, $13 million during 2009 and $11 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P111_S10	Interest Expense Below is a schedule of our interest expense during 2010, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in thousands):
352915_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of senior notes (the Notes ) which formed a single series with the original $250 million of Notes issued in June, 2006 (see Note 4 Long Term Debt ).
352915_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	identical to, and trade interchangeably with, the Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.
352915_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	The proceeds from this issuance were used to repay other outstanding borrowings.
352915_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	Pursuant to the terms of these notes, which were assumed by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI, notice of redemption was provided by us as of the acquisition date and the indenture was satisfied and discharged and these notes were subsequently redeemed on December 15, 2010 utilizing borrowed funds which were held in escrow from November 15, 2010 to the date of redemption.
352915_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	Interest expense increased $32 million during 2010 to $78 million during 2010 as compared to $46 million during 2009.
352915_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	This increase was due primarily to: (i) the increased borrowings used to finance our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, and an increase in the average effective interest rate, as discussed below; (ii) the interest expense incurred during 2010 on the $250 million, 7.00% senior notes issued in September, 2010, and; (iii) the interest expense incurred during 2010 on the $590 million, 7.75% notes assumed in connection with the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010 (these notes were redeemed on December 15, 2010) .
352915_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	During 2010, the average outstanding borrowings under our new $3.45 billion credit agreement (consisting of an $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion Term Loan A and a $1.6 billion Term Loan B) , accounts receivable securitization program and previously outstanding credit agreement was $610 million as compared to $287 million during 2009.
352915_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	The effective interest rate on these facilities, including the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 5.0% during 2010 and 3.9% during 2009.
352915_11_ITEM7_P115_S2	Interest expense decreased $7 million during 2009 to $46 million as compared to $53 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P115_S3	The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the combined interest expense on our revolving credit agreement, demand notes, senior notes and accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_11_ITEM7_P115_S4	This decrease was due primarily to an $81 million decrease in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings on those debt facilities and a 0.4% decrease in the weighted average borrowing rate.
352915_11_ITEM7_P115_S5	Transaction costs incurred in connection with acquisition of PSI During 2010, we incurred $53 million of transaction costs in connection with our acquisitions of PSI in November, 2010, consisting of the following:
352915_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income from continuing operations before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income from continuing operations before income taxes, minus income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands): Impacting the effective tax rates during 2010 were the following items: (i) $5 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust the non-deductible portion of certain transaction costs incurred during 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI; (ii) a $4 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust for the non-deductible, $9 million charge incurred from split-dollar life insurance agreements entered into during 2010 on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife, partially offset by; (iii) a $4 million favorable discrete tax item recorded during 2010 to adjust the estimated non-deductible portion of the previously disclosed South Texas Health System settlement with the government based upon the final agreement.
352915_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	Impacting the effective tax rates during 2009 was a $4 million unfavorable discrete tax item related to the estimated non-deductible portion of the South Texas Health System settlement.
352915_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities, one of which is located in Delaware (MeadowWood Behavioral Health System) and two of which are located in Nevada (Montevista Hospital and Red Rock Hospital) as well as one of our legacy facilities in Puerto Rico (Hospital San Juan Capestrano).
352915_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we are required to divest the facilities in Delaware and Nevada within approximately six months and the facility in Puerto Rico within approximately nine months from the date the FTC finalizes the agreement.
352915_11_ITEM7_P118_S2	As of the date of this filing, our agreement with the FTC is not final and thus, the time period within which we must divest the facilities has not yet commenced.
352915_11_ITEM7_P118_S3	The operating results for the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are reflected as discontinued operations during 2010 from the November 15 th date of acquisition through December 31 st .
352915_11_ITEM7_P118_S4	Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our 2010 consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.
352915_11_ITEM7_P118_S5	The assets and liabilities for MeadowWood Behavioral Health System, Montevista Hospital, Red Rock Hospital and Hospital San Juan Capestrano are reflected as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	During 2008, we sold a 125-bed acute care hospital located in Pennsylvania and commenced divestiture considerations for the real property of our four acute care facilities located in Louisiana that were severely damaged and closed during 2005 as a result of damage sustained from Hurricane Katrina.
352915_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	The operating results and gain on divestiture for the facility located in Pennsylvania are reflected as Income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2008.
352915_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	The following table shows the results of operations of these facilities, on a combined basis, for all facilities reflected as discontinued operations (amounts in thousands): Effects of Inflation and Seasonality Seasonality Our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.
352915_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	Inflation Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years.
352915_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases.
352915_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices.
352915_11_ITEM7_P121_S3	We believe, however, that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.
352915_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	Liquidity Year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009:
352915_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $501 million during 2010 as compared to $541 million during 2009.
352915_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	The net decrease of $40 million, or 7%, was primarily attributable to the following:
352915_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	$5 million of other combined net favorable changes.
352915_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Days sales outstanding ( DSO ): Our DSO are calculated by dividing our annual net revenue by the number of days in the year.
352915_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at the end of the year to obtain the DSO.

352915_11_ITEM7_P145_S2	We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below.
352915_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	On November 15, 2010, we terminated our credit agreement dated March 4, 2005 (the Prior Credit Agreement ).

352915_11_ITEM7_P153_S4	The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities.
352915_11_ITEM7_P153_S5	The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.

352915_11_ITEM7_P153_S10	As of December 31, 2010, we had an aggregate of $577 million of available borrowing capacity pursuant to the terms of our Credit Agreement and Securitization, net of $71 million of outstanding letters of credit and $3 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the short-term, on-demand note.

352915_11_ITEM7_P165_S1	Some of the lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease and our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options.
352915_11_ITEM7_P166_S0	(e) Consists of $220 million of estimated future payments related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan (estimated through 2087), as disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , $14 million of estimated future payments related to another retirement plan liability and $21 million of deferred severance payments due related to our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010.

352915_11_ITEM7_P166_S2	The $21 million of deferred severance payments related to our acquisition of PSI are included in accrued compensation and related benefits as of December 31, 2010.

352915_11_ITEM7_P166_S4	We exclude the $289 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments.
352915_11_ITEM7_P166_S5	Please see Self-Insured Risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.
352915_11_ITEM7_P167_S0	In connection with five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain put rights , that are currently exercisable, that if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member s interests at fair market value.
352915_11_ITEM7_P167_S1	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.

352915_11_ITEM7_P168_S1	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_11_ITEM7_P168_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities approximates the $212 million aggregate book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests.
352915_11_ITEM7_P168_S3	We exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these minority ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertainty as to: (i) whether or not the put rights will actually be exercised; (ii) the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were exercised, and; (iii) the timing of such payments.
352915_11_ITEM7_P168_S4	Additionally, the table above does not include $8 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM7_P169_S0	Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be utilized.

352915_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We may also, from time to time, enter into treasury locks ( T-Locks ) to protect from a rise in the yield of the underlying treasury security for a forecasted bond issuance.
352915_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires additional disclosure about a company s derivative activities, but does not require any new accounting related to derivative activities.
352915_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We have applied the requirements of the guidance on a prospective basis.
352915_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Accordingly, disclosures related to interim periods prior to the date of adoption have not been presented.
352915_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, we entered into three interest rate caps on a total notional amount of $1.00 billion whereby we paid a premium of $240,000 in exchange for the counterparties agreeing to pay the difference between 2.25% and three-month LIBOR if the 3 month LIBOR rate rises above 2.25% during the term of the caps.
352915_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	If the three month LIBOR does not reach 2.25% during the term of the caps, no payment is made to us.
352915_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	All of the caps expire on December 15, 2011.
352915_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We also entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of 2010 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $600 million and receive 3-month LIBOR.
352915_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Each of the four swaps become effective on December 15, 2011 and will mature on May 15, 2015.

352915_11_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The interest rate swaps mature on October 17, 2011 and October 5, 2012 and have fixed rates payable of 4.865% and 4.7625%, respectively.

352915_11_ITEM7A_P7_S1	These T-Locks, which were designated as cash flow hedges, were unwound during the second quarter of 2006 resulting in a $3 million cash payment to us which has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (net of income taxes) and is being amortized over the life of the 10-year Notes.
352915_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.
352915_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	As calculated based upon our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010 that is subject to interest rate fluctuations, each 1% change in interest rates would impact our pre-tax income by approximately $30 million.

352915_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	We are in the process of transferring all accounting for the new acquisition to our headquarters and into our existing internal control procedures.

352915_11_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

352915_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Universal Health Services, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
352915_11_ITEM15_P12_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P12_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_11_ITEM15_P12_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, financial statement schedule, and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included under item 9A as Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
352915_11_ITEM15_P12_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
352915_11_ITEM15_P12_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
352915_11_ITEM15_P12_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
352915_11_ITEM15_P12_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
352915_11_ITEM15_P12_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
352915_11_ITEM15_P12_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
352915_11_ITEM15_P12_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
352915_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_11_ITEM15_P13_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P13_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P13_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
352915_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P14_S1	We have also excluded Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.
352915_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues represent 40% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.

352915_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1) BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Services provided by our hospitals, all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.
352915_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	We, through our subsidiaries, provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	The more significant accounting policies follow: A) Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner.
352915_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
352915_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_11_ITEM15_P25_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 38% of our net patient revenues during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008.
352915_11_ITEM15_P25_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 46% of our net patient revenues during each of 2010, 2009 and 2008.
352915_11_ITEM15_P25_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_11_ITEM15_P25_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_11_ITEM15_P25_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_11_ITEM15_P25_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P25_S7	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_11_ITEM15_P25_S8	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_11_ITEM15_P26_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P26_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	As such, we can not provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P27_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
352915_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_11_ITEM15_P28_S2	Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $807 million during 2010, $671 million during 2009 and $609 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	C) Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_11_ITEM15_P29_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_11_ITEM15_P29_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_11_ITEM15_P29_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payments and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_11_ITEM15_P29_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient is sent a series of statements and collection letters.
352915_11_ITEM15_P29_S6	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_11_ITEM15_P29_S7	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_11_ITEM15_P29_S8	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of $99 million as of December 31, 2010 and $61 million as of December 31, 2009.
352915_11_ITEM15_P29_S9	Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of at least 20% of total charges.
352915_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	During the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay balances outstanding for greater than 60 days from the date of discharge.
352915_11_ITEM15_P30_S1	All self-pay accounts at the hospital level are fully reserved if they have been outstanding for greater than 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_11_ITEM15_P30_S2	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_11_ITEM15_P30_S3	Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.
352915_11_ITEM15_P30_S4	On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience.
352915_11_ITEM15_P30_S5	At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $249 million and $169 million, respectively.
352915_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	D) Concentration of Revenues: Our five majority owned acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined basis, 21% in 2010 and 22% in each of 2009 and 2008, of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	On a combined basis, our facilities in the McAllen/Edinburg, Texas market (consisting of three acute care facilities, a children s hospital and a behavioral health facility) contributed 6% in 2010 and 7% in each of 2009 and 2008 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	E) Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
352915_11_ITEM15_P32_S1	F) Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost.
352915_11_ITEM15_P32_S2	Expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts.
352915_11_ITEM15_P32_S3	Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred.
352915_11_ITEM15_P32_S4	We remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	We capitalize interest expense on major construction projects while in progress.
352915_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	We capitalized interest on major construction projects amounting to $7.6 million during 2010, $11.6 million during 2009 and $7.9 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years).
352915_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	Depreciation expense (excluding discontinued operations) was $202.8 million during 2010, $184.6 million during 2009 and $176.1 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	G) Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_11_ITEM15_P35_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_11_ITEM15_P35_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_11_ITEM15_P35_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_11_ITEM15_P36_S2	We have designated September 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2010 which indicated no impairment of goodwill.
352915_11_ITEM15_P36_S3	There were also no goodwill impairments during 2009 or 2008.
352915_11_ITEM15_P36_S4	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill.
352915_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2010 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	(a) Consists of adjustments to prior year purchase price allocations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	(b) The reduction to the Behavioral Health Services goodwill consists primarily of a reclassification to assets of facilities held for sale and represents the goodwill attributable to a legacy facility which we agreed to divest pursuant to our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission.
352915_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	Other Assets: Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010 consisting of Medicare licenses, certificates of need and contracts to manage the operations of behavioral health services owned by third-parties; (ii) prepaid fees for various software and other applications used by our hospitals; (iii) costs incurred in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities; (iv) deposits; (v) investments in various businesses, including Universal Health Realty Income Trust; (vi) the invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related payable included in other noncurrent liabilities; (vii) the estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and; (viii) other miscellaneous assets.
352915_11_ITEM15_P39_S2	As of December 31, 2010 other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $100 million.
352915_11_ITEM15_P39_S3	Other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were not material to our financial statements as of December 31, 2009.
352915_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	Pursuant to contractual guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2010 that are applicable to future years, we have $15 million of potential future financial obligations of which $13 million are potential obligations during 2011 and $2 million are potential obligations during 2012 and later.
352915_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	K) Self-Insured Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_11_ITEM15_P41_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_11_ITEM15_P41_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_11_ITEM15_P41_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_11_ITEM15_P41_S5	See Note 8 for discussion of revisions to prior year general and professional liability reserves and self-insurance liability assumed in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	Based on the results of workers compensation reserves analyses, we recorded reductions of prior year reserves of $4 million during 2010, $7 million during 2009 and $4 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	L) Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_11_ITEM15_P44_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_11_ITEM15_P45_S2	See Note 6 for additional disclosure regarding income taxes.
352915_11_ITEM15_P45_S3	Other Noncurrent Liabilities: Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general liability, workers compensation reserves, pension and deferred compensation liabilities, liability incurred in connection with split-dollar life insurance agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife and interest rate swap liabilities.
352915_11_ITEM15_P45_S4	Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest:
352915_11_ITEM15_P45_S5	Outside owners hold noncontrolling, minority ownership interests of: (i) approximately 28% in our five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada; (ii) 20% in an acute care facility located in Washington, D.C.; (iii) approximately 11% in an acute care facility located in Laredo, Texas, and; (iv) 20% in a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the majority ownership interest of which was acquired by us as result of our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P45_S6	The redeemable noncontrolling interests balances of $212 million and $197 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and the noncontrolling interests balances of $45 million and $41 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, consist primarily of the third-party ownership interests in these hospitals.
352915_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	Generally accepted accounting principles require that noncontrolling interests be classified as equity and we have previously presented all noncontrolling interests in total equity.
352915_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	However, since certain of our noncontrolling interests have redemption rights outside of our control, those noncontrolling interests are classified outside of permanent equity and reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests.
352915_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	These revisions did not affect stockholders equity attributable to UHS nor did they affect any previously reported percentages based upon equity (such as percentage of debt to total capitalization and return on average equity), since we have based those calculations on only stockholders equity attributable to UHS (as opposed to total equity).
352915_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	We do not believe that these revisions, which are reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Common Stockholders Equity for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, as included herein, are material to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the prior years.
352915_11_ITEM15_P47_S2	The applicable sections of our December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity for the Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, as reported and as revised, are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	In connection with the five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain put rights , that are currently exercisable, that if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member s interests at fair market value.
352915_11_ITEM15_P48_S1	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.
352915_11_ITEM15_P48_S2	In connection with the behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010, the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_11_ITEM15_P48_S3	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_11_ITEM15_P48_S4	As of December 31, 2010, we believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities approximates the book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests.
352915_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive income or loss, is comprised of net income, changes in unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and a pension liability.
352915_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	P) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities: We manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_11_ITEM15_P51_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_11_ITEM15_P53_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_11_ITEM15_P53_S3	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
352915_11_ITEM15_P53_S4	Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.
352915_11_ITEM15_P53_S5	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	Q) Stock-Based Compensation: At December 31, 2010, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans.
352915_11_ITEM15_P54_S1	Pursuant to the FASB s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
352915_11_ITEM15_P54_S2	The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge.
352915_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.
352915_11_ITEM15_P55_S1	The applicable FASB guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows.
352915_11_ITEM15_P55_S2	During 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were no net excess tax benefits generated.
352915_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
352915_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.
352915_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated: The Net effect of dilutive stock options and grants based on the treasury stock method , for all years presented above, excludes certain outstanding stock options applicable to each year since the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
352915_11_ITEM15_P57_S1	The excluded weighted-average stock options totaled 1,000 during 2010, 3.6 million during 2009 and 1.9 million during 2008.
352915_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	S) Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The fair values of our registered debt and investments are based on quoted market prices.
352915_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar maturities and credit quality.
352915_11_ITEM15_P58_S2	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
352915_11_ITEM15_P58_S3	Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	T) Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
352915_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
352915_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
352915_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
352915_11_ITEM15_P60_S2	Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred.
352915_11_ITEM15_P60_S3	The fair value of intangible assets, including Medicare Licenses, Certificates of Need, and certain contracts, is based on significant judgments made by our management, and accordingly, for significant items we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.
352915_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	V) Accounting Standards: Transfers of Financial Assets:
352915_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets.
352915_11_ITEM15_P62_S1	This amendment requires greater transparency and additional disclosures for transfers of financial assets and the entity s continuing involvement with them and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets.
352915_11_ITEM15_P62_S2	In addition, this amendment eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity ( QSPE ).
352915_11_ITEM15_P62_S3	This amendment became effective for us on January 1, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P62_S4	This amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities: In June 2009, the FASB also issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities ( VIE s).
352915_11_ITEM15_P63_S1	The elimination of the concept of a QSPE, as discussed above, removes the exception from applying the consolidation guidance within this amendment.
352915_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	This amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a VIE.
352915_11_ITEM15_P64_S1	The amendment also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a VIE.
352915_11_ITEM15_P64_S2	Additionally, the amendment requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with VIEs and any significant change in risk exposure due to that involvement, as well as how its involvement with VIEs impacts the enterprise s financial statements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P64_S3	Finally, an enterprise will be required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a VIE.
352915_11_ITEM15_P64_S4	This amendment became effective for us on January 1, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P64_S5	This amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	Presentation of Insurance Claims and Related Insurance Recoveries: In August 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Updates ( ASU ) 2010-24, Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Presentation of Insurance Claims and Related Insurance Recoveries, which clarifies that a health care entity should not net insurance recoveries against a related claim liability.
352915_11_ITEM15_P65_S1	The guidance provided in this ASU is effective for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P65_S2	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	Measuring Charity Care for Disclosures: In August 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-23, Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Measuring Charity Care for Disclosure, which prescribes a specific measurement basis of charity care for disclosure.
352915_11_ITEM15_P66_S1	The guidance provided in this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P66_S2	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ( ASU 2010-06).
352915_11_ITEM15_P67_S1	ASU 2010-06 affects all entities that are required to make disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements under FASB ASC Topic 820, originally issued as FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements .
352915_11_ITEM15_P67_S2	This ASU requires certain new disclosures and clarifies two existing disclosure requirements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P67_S3	The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
352915_11_ITEM15_P68_S1	ASU No. 2010-06 is not expected to have a significant impact on our disclosures.
352915_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	2) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES Year ended December 31, 2010: 2010 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2010, we spent $1.96 billion and assumed $1.08 billion of debt on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:
352915_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	the acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. on November 15, 2010 for a total purchase price of $3.04 billion consisting of $1.96 billion in cash plus the assumption of approximately $1.08 billion of PSI s debt, the majority of which has since been refinanced.
352915_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of an outpatient surgery center located in Florida in which we previously held a 20% minority ownership interest.
352915_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	The purchase price consideration in connection with this transaction, which occurred during the first quarter, consisted of acquisition of the net assets less the assumption of the outstanding liabilities and third-party debt.
352915_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their preliminary estimated fair values as follows: Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price.
352915_11_ITEM15_P71_S3	The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities: (i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.
352915_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities, one of which is located in Delaware (MeadowWood Behavioral Health System) and two of which are located in Nevada (Montevista Hospital and Red Rock Hospital) as well as one of our legacy facilities in Puerto Rico (Hospital San Juan Capestrano).
352915_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we are required to divest the facilities in Delaware and Nevada within approximately six months and the facility in Puerto Rico within approximately nine months from the date the FTC finalizes the agreement.
352915_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	is not final and thus, the time period within which we must divest the facilities has not yet commenced.

352915_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	Deferred taxes are required to be classified based on the financial statement classification of the related assets and liabilities which give rise to temporary differences.
352915_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
352915_11_ITEM15_P128_S1	The components of deferred taxes are as follows (amounts in thousands): Increases in deferred tax assets relating to self-insurance reserves, compensation related accruals, allowance for uncollectible patient accounts, and net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards as well as increases in deferred tax liabilities relating to depreciable and separately identifiable intangible assets primarily reflect the impact of deferred taxes recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.

352915_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	Impacting the effective tax rates during 2010 were the following items: (i) $5 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust the non-deductible portion of certain transaction costs incurred during 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI; (ii) a $4 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust for the non-deductible, $9 million charge incurred from split-dollar life insurance agreements entered into during 2010 on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife, partially offset by; (iii) a $4 million favorable discrete tax item recorded during 2010 to adjust the estimated non-deductible portion of the previously disclosed South Texas Health System settlement with the government based upon the final agreement.
352915_11_ITEM15_P131_S1	Impacting the effective tax rates during 2009 was a $4 million unfavorable discrete tax item related to the estimated non-deductible portion of the South Texas Health System settlement.
352915_11_ITEM15_P131_S2	A reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate on continuing operations is as follows: Included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are prepaid federal and state income taxes amounting to $51.2 million and $555,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
352915_11_ITEM15_P131_S3	The net deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised as follows (amounts in thousands): The assets and liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible patient accounts, compensation-related accruals and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self- insurance reserves.
352915_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	At December 31, 2010, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2011 through 2030), and credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $662 million, representing approximately $33.3 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit).
352915_11_ITEM15_P132_S1	At December 31, 2010 related to the acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc., there were federal net operating losses of $3.3 million expiring in 2022 representing approximately $1.1 million in deferred federal tax benefits, federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $9.0 million expiring in 2014 representing approximately $3.4 million in deferred federal and state tax benefit, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10.6 million expiring through 2017 representing approximately $4.5 million in deferred foreign tax benefit.
352915_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
352915_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
352915_11_ITEM15_P134_S1	During 2010, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by $3.1 million due to additional net operating losses incurred and an increase of $1.6 million due to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.
352915_11_ITEM15_P134_S2	In addition, there was a $4.5 million increase in the valuation allowance related to foreign net operating losses due to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.
352915_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	We adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007.
352915_11_ITEM15_P135_S1	During 2010 and 2009, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased in the amount of approximately $3.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years.
352915_11_ITEM15_P135_S2	The increase in 2010 is primarily attributable to tax positions taken by Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. on pre-acquisition tax return years.
352915_11_ITEM15_P135_S3	Also during 2010, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately $1 million.
352915_11_ITEM15_P135_S4	The balance at December 31, 2010 and 2009, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately $5 million and $4 million, respectively.
352915_11_ITEM15_P135_S5	We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.
352915_11_ITEM15_P135_S6	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we have approximately $1 million of accrued interest and penalties.
352915_11_ITEM15_P135_S7	The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2007 and subsequent years.
352915_11_ITEM15_P136_S0	Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years.
352915_11_ITEM15_P136_S1	The statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months.
352915_11_ITEM15_P136_S2	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months however it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P136_S3	The tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (amounts in thousands).

352915_11_ITEM15_P137_S1	Certain of these leases also contain provisions allowing us to purchase the leased assets during the term or at the expiration of the lease at fair market value.
352915_11_ITEM15_P137_S2	We also lease the real property of certain facilities acquired by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010.

352915_11_ITEM15_P138_S0	Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as of December 31, 2010, are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_11_ITEM15_P138_S1	In the ordinary course of business, our facilities routinely lease equipment pursuant to month-to-month lease arrangements that will likely result in future lease rental expense in excess of the amounts indicated above.
352915_11_ITEM15_P138_S2	Capital lease obligations of $7.1 million in 2010, $700,000 in 2009 and $3.4 million in 2008 were incurred when we assumed capital lease obligations upon the acquisition of facilities or entered into capital leases for new equipment.
352915_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Professional and General Liability Claims and Property Insurance Professional and General Liability Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence (as compared to $20 million per occurrence prior to 2008).
352915_11_ITEM15_P139_S1	Prior to our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_11_ITEM15_P139_S2	However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_11_ITEM15_P139_S3	Prior to our acquisition in November, 2010, the PSI facilities were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a $3 million self-insured retention to a limit of $75 million.
352915_11_ITEM15_P139_S4	PSI utilized its captive insurance company to manage the self-insured retention and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of PSI.
352915_11_ITEM15_P139_S5	Since our acquisition of PSI on November 15, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries (which are not former PSI subsidiaries) are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence.
352915_11_ITEM15_P139_S6	Effective November, 2010, our subsidiaries (including the former PSI subsidiaries) were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_11_ITEM15_P139_S7	We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_11_ITEM15_P140_S1	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_11_ITEM15_P140_S2	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P140_S3	Upon our acquisition of PSI, we conducted a thorough analysis of PSI s claims and related reserves and, with the assistance of an independent third-party actuary, we determined that the aggregate self-insured retention estimate for the pre-acquisition professional and general liability claims amounted to $51 million which is included in our total accrual as of December 31, 2010, as discussed below.
352915_11_ITEM15_P140_S4	As of December 31, 2010, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims, including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from PSI, was $289 million, of which $60 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_11_ITEM15_P140_S5	As of December 31, 2009, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $266 million, of which $46 million is included in other current liabilities.
352915_11_ITEM15_P140_S6	Based upon the results of reserve analyses, we recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $49 million during 2010 and $23 million during 2009.
352915_11_ITEM15_P140_S7	These favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments were due to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 75% from 50%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 25% from 50%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years.
352915_11_ITEM15_P140_S8	As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends.
352915_11_ITEM15_P140_S9	Actuarially determined estimates for our 2011 provision for self-insured professional and general liability claims were developed based upon similar metrics and weighting.
352915_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	We have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to $250,000 deductible.
352915_11_ITEM15_P141_S1	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_11_ITEM15_P141_S2	In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses.).
352915_11_ITEM15_P141_S3	Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented fault zones.
352915_11_ITEM15_P141_S4	Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_11_ITEM15_P141_S5	The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million.
352915_11_ITEM15_P141_S6	Flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.
352915_11_ITEM15_P141_S7	Behavioral health care facilities acquired in November, 2010 The newly acquired facilities formerly owned by PSI have all risk property coverage with a loss limit of $100 million with a $25,000 deductible.

352915_11_ITEM15_P142_S1	Earthquake coverage in California is further sub-limited to an annual aggregate loss limit of $50 million with a deductible of 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_11_ITEM15_P142_S2	Named windstorms are insured to $100 million per occurrence but are potentially subject to applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_11_ITEM15_P142_S3	Flood losses are subject to an annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million with deductibles ranging from $50,000 to $100,000.
352915_11_ITEM15_P142_S4	Flood losses that occur in designated high hazard areas are sub-limited to $25 million with a $500,000 deductible.
352915_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	Due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years, the cost of commercial property insurance has increased.
352915_11_ITEM15_P143_S1	As a result, catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_11_ITEM15_P143_S2	Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	Legal Proceedings U.S. v. Marion and UHS: In late 2007, July, 2008 and January, 2009, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) issued a series of subpoenas seeking documents related to the treatment of Medicaid beneficiaries at two of our facilities, Marion Youth Center and Mountain Youth Academy,.
352915_11_ITEM15_P144_S1	It was our understanding at that time that the OIG was investigating whether claims for reimbursement submitted by those facilities to the Virginia Medicaid program were supported by adequate documentation of the services provided which could be considered to be a basis for a false claims act violation.
352915_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	In August, 2008, the Office of the Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Virginia issued a subpoena to Keystone Newport News, another of our facilities.
352915_11_ITEM15_P145_S1	It was our understanding at that time that the Office of Attorney General was investigating whether Keystone Newport News complied with various Virginia laws and regulations, including documentation requirements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P145_S2	In response to these subpoenas, we produced the requested documents on a rolling basis and we cooperated with the investigations in all respects.
352915_11_ITEM15_P145_S3	We also met with representatives of the OIG, the Virginia Attorney General, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, and the United States Department of Justice Civil Division on several occasions to discuss a possible resolution of this matter.
352915_11_ITEM15_P145_S4	However, the parties were not able to reach a resolution.
352915_11_ITEM15_P145_S5	Consequently, in November, 2009, the United States Department of Justice and the Virginia Attorney General intervened in a qui tam case that had been filed by former employees of Marion Youth Center under seal in 2007 against Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ), and Keystone Marion, LLC and Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC ( Keystone ).
352915_11_ITEM15_P145_S6	The Department of Justice and the Commonwealth of Virginia filed and served their complaint which, at present, relates solely to the Marion Youth Center.
352915_11_ITEM15_P145_S7	The complaint originally alleged causes of action pursuant to the federal and state false claims acts, the Virginia fraud statute, and unjust enrichment.
352915_11_ITEM15_P145_S8	The former employees filed a separate amended complaint, alleging employment and retaliation claims as well as false claim act violations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P145_S9	In April, 2010, the defendants in the lawsuit filed motions to dismiss the claims filed by the government and the former employees.
352915_11_ITEM15_P145_S10	In July, 2010, the court ruled on the motions, granting them in part and denying them in part.
352915_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	The court has allowed the government to proceed with its claims under the federal and state false claims act and the Virginia fraud statute.
352915_11_ITEM15_P146_S1	In addition, the court has allowed the former employees to proceed with parts of their employment related and retaliation claims.
352915_11_ITEM15_P146_S2	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
352915_11_ITEM15_P146_S3	We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously against the government s and the former employees allegations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P146_S4	There can be no assurance that we will prevail in the litigation or that the case will be limited to the Marion Youth Center.
352915_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	v. Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC: Alicante School in California was acquired by a subsidiary of ours in October, 2005.
352915_11_ITEM15_P147_S1	Prior to our acquisition, two former employees of the facility filed a false claim act qui tam action and a gender discrimination/whistleblower claim in Sacramento County Superior Court.
352915_11_ITEM15_P147_S2	The plaintiffs allege that the Alicante School improperly billed subdivisions of the state of California based upon services provided at the school and that the plaintiffs were discriminated against based upon their gender and as a result of their objection to these practices.
352915_11_ITEM15_P147_S3	In June, 2008, we entered into an agreement with the former owners of the facility whereby they agreed to defend the case, indemnify us and hold us harmless for any damages that may result from this case.
352915_11_ITEM15_P147_S4	The former owners of the facility had been funding the legal defense of this case since that time.
352915_11_ITEM15_P147_S5	Recently, the court approved the agreed upon $9.5 million settlement of this matter which we paid to the plaintiffs in January, 2011.
352915_11_ITEM15_P147_S6	Since we have made a demand on the former owners of the facility for repayment, and intend to pursue collection of the $9.5 million pursuant to the June, 2008 indemnification agreement (although we can provide no assurance that we will collect the entire $9.5 million), the settlement amount and related receivable is reflected in other current assets and other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	Martin v. UHS of Delaware: UHS of Delaware, Inc., a subsidiary, and one of our non-public schools in California operated by one of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a state False Claim Act case in Sacramento County Superior Court.
352915_11_ITEM15_P148_S1	Plaintiffs are a former student and employees of the Elmira School who claim that the UHS Schools in California unlawfully retained public education funding from the state of California for the operation of these schools but failed to meet state requirements to qualify as a non-public school.
352915_11_ITEM15_P148_S2	Plaintiffs have also claimed that we committed unfair business practices associated with these allegations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P148_S3	We deny liability and intend to defend this case vigorously.
352915_11_ITEM15_P148_S4	We are presently uncertain as to the legal viability of the claims and are unable to determine the extent of potential financial exposure, if any, at this time.
352915_11_ITEM15_P149_S0	Wage and Hour Class Actions: Ethridge v. Universal Health Services et.
352915_11_ITEM15_P149_S1	al: In June, 2008, we and one of our acute care facilities, Lancaster Community Hospital, were named as defendants in a wage and hour lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
352915_11_ITEM15_P149_S2	This is a purported class action lawsuit alleging that the hospital failed to provide sufficient meal and break periods to certain employees.
352915_11_ITEM15_P149_S3	In June, 2010 a settlement was reached with the attorneys for the class representative.
352915_11_ITEM15_P149_S4	The settlement was recently approved by the court.
352915_11_ITEM15_P149_S5	The reserve established for the settlement of this matter did not have a material impact on our 2010 consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P149_S6	Other: We and/or our subsidiaries are presently involved in three other wage and hour class action cases in California and Tennessee.
352915_11_ITEM15_P149_S7	Two of those cases have been certified as a class by the California State Superior Court in Alameda County and the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, respectively.
352915_11_ITEM15_P149_S8	At present, we are uncertain as to the extent of potential financial exposure but do not believe potential settlements or judgments in these cases will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P150_S0	Department of Justice ICD Investigation: In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICDs ) from 2003 to the present at several of our acute care facilities.
352915_11_ITEM15_P151_S0	contravention of a National Claims Determination regarding these devices.
352915_11_ITEM15_P151_S1	At present, we are uncertain as to the extent of the claims, liability for such claims and potential financial exposure in connection with this matter.
352915_11_ITEM15_P152_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse.
352915_11_ITEM15_P152_S1	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
352915_11_ITEM15_P152_S2	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_11_ITEM15_P153_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_11_ITEM15_P153_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_11_ITEM15_P153_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein.
352915_11_ITEM15_P153_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_11_ITEM15_P154_S0	Southwest Healthcare System: During the third quarter of 2009, Southwest Healthcare System ( SWHCS ), which operates Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center in Riverside County, California, entered into an agreement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ).
352915_11_ITEM15_P154_S1	The agreement required SWHCS to engage an independent quality monitor to assist SWHCS in meeting all CMS conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM15_P154_S2	Further, the agreement provided that, during the last 60 days of the agreement, CMS would conduct a full Medicare certification survey.
352915_11_ITEM15_P154_S3	That survey took place the week of January 11, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P155_S0	In April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from CMS that it intended to effectuate the termination of SWHCS s Medicare provider agreement effective June 1, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P155_S1	In May, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CMS which abated the termination action scheduled for June 1, 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P155_S2	The agreement is one year in duration and required SWHCS to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for SWHCS to meet the Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM15_P155_S3	At the conclusion of the agreement, CMS will conduct a full certification survey to determine if SWHCS has achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_11_ITEM15_P155_S4	During the term of the agreement, SWHCS remains eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.
352915_11_ITEM15_P156_S0	Also in April, 2010, SWHCS received notification from the California Department of Public Health ( CDPH ) indicating that it planned to initiate a process to revoke SWHCS s hospital license.
352915_11_ITEM15_P156_S1	In May, 2010, SWHCS received the formal document related to the revocation action.
352915_11_ITEM15_P156_S2	In September, 2010, SWHCS entered into an agreement with CDPH relating to the license revocation.
352915_11_ITEM15_P156_S3	The terms of the CDPH agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with CMS.
352915_11_ITEM15_P156_S4	As a result of the agreement, SWHCS s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the CMS full certification survey which will occur at the end of the agreement.
352915_11_ITEM15_P157_S0	Pursuant to the results of the CMS full certification survey, which we anticipate occurring in mid-year, 2011, should SWHCS be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, CDPH shall deem SWHCS s license to be in good standing.
352915_11_ITEM15_P157_S1	Failure of SWHCS to achieve substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation, pursuant to CMS s full certification survey, will likely have a material adverse impact on SWHCS s ability to continue to operate the facilities.
352915_11_ITEM15_P158_S0	As a result of the matters discussed above, we were not previously permitted to open newly constructed capacity at Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center.
352915_11_ITEM15_P158_S1	However, in February, 2011, we received permission from CDPH to begin accessing the new capacity.
352915_11_ITEM15_P158_S2	Unrelated to these developments, we expect a competitor to open a newly constructed acute care hospital during the first quarter of 2011.
352915_11_ITEM15_P158_S3	We are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on SWHCS s results of operations in 2011 and beyond.
352915_11_ITEM15_P159_S0	Rancho Springs Medical Center and Inland Valley Medical Center remain fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the communities they serve.
352915_11_ITEM15_P159_S1	We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both CMS and CDPH in an effort to resolve these matters, although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so.
352915_11_ITEM15_P159_S2	Failure to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_11_ITEM15_P160_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, SWHCS generated approximately 1.1% and 4.3%, respectively, of our income from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_11_ITEM15_P161_S0	The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition of PSI which was completed in November, 2010: Garden City Employees Retirement System v. PSI: This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws.
352915_11_ITEM15_P161_S1	We are uncertain at this time as to potential liability and damages but intend to defend the case vigorously.
352915_11_ITEM15_P162_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Sierra Vista: In 2009, Sierra Vista Hospital in Sacramento, California learned of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) relating to Medicare services provided by the facility.
352915_11_ITEM15_P162_S1	The DOJ ultimately notified the facility that with respect to partial hospitalization and outpatient services, the DOJ believed that the medical record documentation did not adequately support the claims submitted for reimbursement by Medicare.
352915_11_ITEM15_P162_S2	We recently reached a tentative financial settlement with the DOJ.
352915_11_ITEM15_P162_S3	The reserve established in connection with this matter did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P162_S4	As part of that agreement, the facility will be subject to a corporate integrity agreement, the terms of which have not yet been finalized.
352915_11_ITEM15_P163_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_11_ITEM15_P164_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_11_ITEM15_P164_S1	The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_11_ITEM15_P164_S2	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_11_ITEM15_P165_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_11_ITEM15_P165_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_11_ITEM15_P165_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ and we continue to cooperate with the DOJ with respect to this investigation.
352915_11_ITEM15_P165_S3	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_11_ITEM15_P166_S0	Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims: The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services ( DMAS ) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state s Medicaid Provider Services Manual ( Manual ).
352915_11_ITEM15_P166_S1	As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities.
352915_11_ITEM15_P166_S2	PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending.
352915_11_ITEM15_P166_S3	Currently, and from time to time, some of our other facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_11_ITEM15_P166_S4	If one of our facilities is found to have violated these laws and regulations, the facility may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_11_ITEM15_P166_S5	We do not believe that, other than as described above, any such existing action would materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_11_ITEM15_P166_S6	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_11_ITEM15_P166_S7	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

352915_11_ITEM15_P170_S0	The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries.
352915_11_ITEM15_P170_S1	Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms.

352915_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers.
352915_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	As of February 24, 2012, we owned and/or operated 25 acute care hospitals and 198 behavioral health centers located in 36 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 6 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 4 states and Puerto Rico.
352915_12_ITEM1_P0_S3	In November, 2010, we acquired Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ).
352915_12_ITEM1_P0_S4	PSI was formerly the largest operator of freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities operating a total of 105 inpatient and outpatient facilities in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_12_ITEM1_P0_S5	Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 55% of our consolidated net revenues in 2011, 70% in 2010 and 74% in 2009.
352915_12_ITEM1_P0_S6	Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 45% of our consolidated net revenues during 2011, 30% during 2010 and 25% during 2009.
352915_12_ITEM1_P0_S7	Approximately 1% of our consolidated net revenues in 2009 were recorded in connection with two construction management contracts pursuant to the terms of which we built newly constructed acute care hospitals for an unrelated third party.
352915_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.
352915_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	We are a Delaware corporation that was organized in 1979.
352915_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	Our principal executive offices are located at Universal Corporate Center, 367 South Gulph Road, P.O. Box 61558, King of Prussia, PA 19406.

352915_12_ITEM1_P1_S11	We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K relating to amendments to or waivers of any provision of our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers by promptly posting this information on our website.
352915_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	In accordance with Section 303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, we submitted our CEO s certification to the New York Stock Exchange in 2011.
352915_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	Additionally, contained in Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are our CEO s and CFO s certifications regarding the quality of our public disclosures under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
352915_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our Mission Our mission and objective is to provide superior healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends, physicians prefer for their patients, purchasers select for their clients, employees are proud of, and investors seek for long-term results.
352915_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	To achieve this, we have a commitment to:
352915_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	innovation in service delivery Business Strategy We believe community-based hospitals will remain the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of self-determination for both the company and our hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	We selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	We are committed to a program of rational growth around our core businesses, while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve.
352915_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P4_S4	We also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.
352915_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Improvement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.
352915_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	We also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.
352915_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P5_S3	Applications to state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals are currently on file in states which require certificates of need, or CONs.
352915_12_ITEM1_P5_S4	Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.
352915_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible.
352915_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	We are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services.
352915_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures.
352915_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees, communities and our stockholders.
352915_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Acquisition and Divestiture Activity: Acquisitions: During 2011, we paid approximately $29 million, excluding the assumption of $17 million of third-party debt, to: (i) acquire the real property of administrative/office buildings located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Washington, D.C.; (ii) fund a deposit in connection with execution of a definitive agreement, which is subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions, to acquire the Knapp Medical Center, including a 226-bed acute care hospital, a surgery center, physician practices and other related assets located in Weslaco, Texas, and; (iii) purchase a cardiology practice in Texas.
352915_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	Divestitures: During 2011 and January of 2012, we received aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately $118 million for the sale of:
352915_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Hospital San Juan Capestrano, a 108-bed behavioral health facility located in Puerto Rico.
352915_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Montevista Hospital (101-bed) and Red Rock Hospital (21-bed) located in Las Vegas, Nevada.
352915_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Meadowood Behavioral Health System, a 58-bed behavioral health facility located in New Castle, Delaware.
352915_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	other dispositions during 2011 including the real property of a closed acute care hospital and the sale of our majority ownership interest in a radiation oncology center located in Nevada.
352915_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	The aggregate net pre-tax gain on the above-mentioned divestitures (excluding the Hospital San Juan Capestrano which was divested in January, 2012) did not have a material impact on our 2011 consolidated results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	The pre-tax gain on the divestiture of the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, which will not have a material impact on our 2012 consolidated results of operations, will be reflected in our consolidated results of operations during the first quarter of 2012.
352915_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	The assets and liabilities for the Hospital San Juan Capestrano are reflected as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM1_P11_S4	The PSI Acquisition In November, 2010, we acquired Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. for a total purchase price of $3.04 billion consisting of $1.96 billion in cash plus the assumption of approximately $1.08 billion of PSI s debt, the majority of which has since been refinanced.
352915_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	PSI was formerly the largest operator of freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities operating a total of 105 inpatient and outpatient facilities in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	The facilities acquired by us, with an aggregate of approximately 11,500 licensed beds at the time of acqusition, offer an extensive continuum of behavioral health programs to critically ill children, adolescents and adults.
352915_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	We also acquired management contracts to manage freestanding behavioral health care inpatient facilities for government agencies and behavioral health units within certain medical/surgical hospitals owned by third-parties.
352915_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	Combined with our previously existing behavioral health care operations located throughout the U.S., we believe this acquisition makes us the largest facility-based provider in the behavioral health care sector.
352915_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	We also achieved planned operating expense reductions during 2011 primarily through the elimination of PSI-related corporate overhead.
352915_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	This acquisition also helps diminish our geographic concentration in certain markets thereby diversifying our overall portfolio and reducing our reliance on one hospital or a cluster of hospitals in a certain market.
352915_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	We believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility.
352915_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	Generally, we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians.
352915_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	Other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology.
352915_12_ITEM1_P14_S4	Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors.
352915_12_ITEM1_P14_S5	We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate.
352915_12_ITEM1_P14_S6	In addition, hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_12_ITEM1_P14_S7	The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated.
352915_12_ITEM1_P14_S8	Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture.
352915_12_ITEM1_P14_S9	Information related to the behavioral health care facilities acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of PSI is included for the period of November 16, 2010 through December 31, 2011, excluding the 3 former PSI facilities that are reflected as discontinued operations, as discussed herein.
352915_12_ITEM1_P14_S10	The licensed and available beds for those facilities are included in 2010 on a weighted average basis for the period owned.
352915_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	(1) Central Montgomery Medical Center located in Pennsylvania was divested during the fourth quarter of 2008.
352915_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	The statistical information for this facility is included in the above information through the divestiture date.
352915_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	(2) Average Available Beds is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available for patient care.
352915_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	(3) Patient Days is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.
352915_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	(4) Occupancy Rate is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of average beds, either available or licensed.
352915_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Sources of Revenue We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Sources of Revenue for additional disclosure.
352915_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Reporting.
352915_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self-referrals by physicians).
352915_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected.
352915_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.
352915_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Licensing, Certification and Accreditation: All of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness.
352915_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments.
352915_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.
352915_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	All of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by the Joint Commission.
352915_12_ITEM1_P21_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P21_S5	If any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors.
352915_12_ITEM1_P21_S6	We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards.
352915_12_ITEM1_P21_S7	The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Certificates of Need: Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need ( CON ) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility s license, which could harm our business.
352915_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions.
352915_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_12_ITEM1_P24_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Utilization Review: Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services.
352915_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	The law and regulations require Peer Review Organizations ( PROs ) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group ( DRG ) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay.
352915_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program.
352915_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.
352915_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	Audits: Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims.
352915_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights.
352915_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	The federal government contracts with third-party recovery audit contractors ( RACs ) and Medicaid integrity contractors ( MICs ), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers.
352915_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	Permanent RAC audits were created by Section 302 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 and required the secretary to expand the program to all 50 states by no later than 2010.
352915_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors ( ZPICs ) target claims for potential fraud and abuse.
352915_12_ITEM1_P28_S3	Additionally, Medicare administrative contractors ( MACs ) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers.
352915_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years, the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial.
352915_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
352915_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation The Stark Law:
352915_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met.
352915_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	These types of referrals are known as self-referrals.
352915_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	for each violation, up to $100,000 for sham arrangements, up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs.
352915_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart.
352915_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.
352915_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.
352915_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	Anti-kickback Statute: A provision of the Social Security Act known as the anti-kickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program.
352915_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	However, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti-kickback statute in order to be found guilty of violating such law.
352915_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	The anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors, from the federal anti-kickback statute for various activities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services.
352915_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws.
352915_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Similar State Laws: Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care.
352915_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure.
352915_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes.
352915_12_ITEM1_P39_S3	However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
352915_12_ITEM1_P39_S4	These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see Legal Proceedings ), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_12_ITEM1_P40_S3	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs.
352915_12_ITEM1_P40_S4	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations: A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the False Claims Act s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions.
352915_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.
352915_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	When a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim.
352915_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act.
352915_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government.
352915_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 ( FERA ) has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds.
352915_12_ITEM1_P45_S2	FERA also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments.
352915_12_ITEM1_P45_S3	In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act.
352915_12_ITEM1_P45_S4	Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court.
352915_12_ITEM1_P45_S5	Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions: The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_12_ITEM1_P45_S6	False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud.
352915_12_ITEM1_P45_S7	Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.
352915_12_ITEM1_P45_S8	Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs.
352915_12_ITEM1_P45_S9	HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare.
352915_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.
352915_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:
352915_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH ), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically.
352915_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry.
352915_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information.
352915_12_ITEM1_P47_S3	The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed.
352915_12_ITEM1_P47_S4	Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.
352915_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	Compliance with the electronic data transmission standards became mandatory in October 2003.
352915_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	However, during the following year, HHS agreed to allow providers and other electronic billers to continue to submit pre-HIPAA format electronic claims for periods after October 16, 2003, provided they can show good faith efforts to become HIPAA compliant.
352915_12_ITEM1_P48_S2	Since this exception expired, we believe that we have been in compliance with the electronic data transmission standards.
352915_12_ITEM1_P48_S3	We were required to comply with the privacy requirements of HIPAA by April 14, 2003.
352915_12_ITEM1_P48_S4	We believe that we were in material compliance with the privacy regulations by that date and remain so, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance.
352915_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information.
352915_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements.
352915_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	HITECH has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred.
352915_12_ITEM1_P49_S3	We were required to comply with the security regulations by April 20, 2005 and believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date.
352915_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft.
352915_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010, signed on December 18, 2010, appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the Red Flags Rule, but permits the FTC or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the Red Flags Rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft.
352915_12_ITEM1_P50_S2	Compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future.
352915_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005: On July 29, 2005, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 was enacted, which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety.
352915_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	This legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report Patient Safety Work Product ( PSWP ) to Patient Safety Organizations ( PSOs ).
352915_12_ITEM1_P51_S2	Under the system, PSWP is made privileged, confidential and legally protected from disclosure.
352915_12_ITEM1_P51_S3	PSWP does not include medical, discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety.
352915_12_ITEM1_P51_S4	This legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute PSWP.
352915_12_ITEM1_P51_S5	PSOs are certified by the Secretary of the HHS for three-year periods and analyze PSWP, provide feedback to providers and may report non-identifiable PSWP to a database.
352915_12_ITEM1_P51_S6	In addition, PSOs are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies.
352915_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs.
352915_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P52_S3	We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.
352915_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine: Several states, including Florida, Nevada, California and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services.
352915_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties.
352915_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable.
352915_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.
352915_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians.
352915_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.
352915_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	EMTALA: All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act ( EMTALA ).
352915_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	This federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition.
352915_12_ITEM1_P56_S2	Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment.
352915_12_ITEM1_P56_S3	There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay.
352915_12_ITEM1_P56_S4	Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program.
352915_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.
352915_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions.
352915_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future.
352915_12_ITEM1_P58_S3	We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.
352915_12_ITEM1_P58_S4	Health Care Industry Investigations: We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation.
352915_12_ITEM1_P58_S5	Legal Proceedings included herein for additional disclosure.
352915_12_ITEM1_P58_S6	In addition, currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_12_ITEM1_P58_S7	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_12_ITEM1_P59_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P59_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.
352915_12_ITEM1_P59_S4	Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P59_S5	It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity.
352915_12_ITEM1_P59_S6	It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.
352915_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them.
352915_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.
352915_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	State Rate Review: Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state.
352915_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform: Medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level.
352915_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	All states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits.
352915_12_ITEM1_P62_S2	Over half of the states have limits on damages awards.
352915_12_ITEM1_P62_S3	Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits, and many states have established limits on attorney fees.
352915_12_ITEM1_P62_S4	Recently, many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform.
352915_12_ITEM1_P62_S5	Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform, and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates.
352915_12_ITEM1_P62_S6	Reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.
352915_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	Compliance Program: Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998.
352915_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	Currently, the program s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program s policies.
352915_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	Since its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry s expectations and our needs.
352915_12_ITEM1_P63_S3	Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business.
352915_12_ITEM1_P63_S4	Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program.
352915_12_ITEM1_P63_S5	Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas.
352915_12_ITEM1_P63_S6	Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.
352915_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	Medical Staff and Employees Our facilities had approximately 65,400 employees on December 31, 2011, of whom approximately 46,500 were employed full-time.
352915_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	Typically, physicians are not employees of our hospitals and in a number of our markets may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours.
352915_12_ITEM1_P65_S2	Within our acute care division, approximately 100 physicians are employed either directly by certain of our facilities or affiliated by group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P65_S3	Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time.
352915_12_ITEM1_P65_S4	In addition, we employ approximately 350 psychiatrists within our behavioral health division.
352915_12_ITEM1_P65_S5	Each of our hospitals are managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by us.
352915_12_ITEM1_P65_S6	In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital.
352915_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	Approximately 2,100 of our employees at seven of our hospitals are unionized.
352915_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	At Valley Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating Engineers and the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ).
352915_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	Nurses and technicians at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the SEIU.
352915_12_ITEM1_P66_S3	Registered nurses at Auburn Regional Medical Center located in Washington are represented by the United Staff Nurses Union, the technical employees are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers, and the service employees are represented by the SEIU.
352915_12_ITEM1_P66_S4	At The George Washington University Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the SEIU or the Hospital Police Association.
352915_12_ITEM1_P66_S5	Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain technicians and therapists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU.
352915_12_ITEM1_P66_S6	At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Teamsters and the Northwestern Nurses Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals.
352915_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
352915_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	The health care industry is highly competitive.
352915_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment.
352915_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes.
352915_12_ITEM1_P69_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_12_ITEM1_P69_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us.
352915_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.
352915_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in determining a hospital s success and competitive advantage.
352915_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_12_ITEM1_P71_S2	We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient s needs, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital s facilities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P71_S3	We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.
352915_12_ITEM1_P71_S4	In addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals.
352915_12_ITEM1_P71_S5	We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_12_ITEM1_P71_S6	Our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate.
352915_12_ITEM1_P71_S7	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_12_ITEM1_P71_S8	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	Many states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws.
352915_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states.
352915_12_ITEM1_P72_S2	In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.
352915_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges.
352915_12_ITEM1_P74_S2	In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients.
352915_12_ITEM1_P74_S3	Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience.
352915_12_ITEM1_P74_S4	The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.
352915_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	A key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets.
352915_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	The competition to acquire hospitals is significant.
352915_12_ITEM1_P75_S2	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P75_S3	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_12_ITEM1_P75_S4	We intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.
352915_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust At December 31, 2011, we held approximately 6.2% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the Trust ).
352915_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
352915_12_ITEM1_P76_S2	In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust.
352915_12_ITEM1_P76_S3	Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.
352915_12_ITEM1_P76_S4	We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $2.0 million during 2011, $1.8 million during 2010 and $1.6 million during 2009.
352915_12_ITEM1_P76_S5	Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $4.6 million during 2011, $1.0 million during 2010 and $1.1 million during 2009, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year.
352915_12_ITEM1_P76_S6	Included in our share of the Trust s income for 2011 was approximately $3.7 million related to our share of the following: (i) an aggregate gain realized by the Trust during 2011 in connection with the sale of medical office buildings by various limited liability companies ( LLCs ) in which the Trust formerly held noncontrolling, majority ownership interests; (ii) an aggregate gain recorded by the Trust during 2011 in connection with its purchases of third-party minority ownership interests in various LLCs in which the Trust formerly held noncontrolling majority ownership interests (the Trust now owns 100% of each of these entities), partially offset by; (iii) a provision for asset impairment recorded by the Trust during 2011 in connection with a medical office building located in Atlanta, Georgia.
352915_12_ITEM1_P76_S7	The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $9.9 million and $7.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
352915_12_ITEM1_P76_S8	The market value of our investment in the Trust was $30.7 million at December 31, 2011 and $28.8 million at December 31, 2010, based on the closing price of the Trust s stock on the respective dates.
352915_12_ITEM1_P76_S9	Total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the Trust (as discussed below) was $16.3 million during 2011, $16.2 million during 2010 and $16.3 million during 2009.
352915_12_ITEM1_P76_S10	In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds either 100% of the ownership interest or various noncontrolling, majority ownership interests.
352915_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries.
352915_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below.
352915_12_ITEM1_P78_S1	The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year.
352915_12_ITEM1_P78_S2	The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.
352915_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term.
352915_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.
352915_12_ITEM1_P79_S2	We also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at their appraised fair market value as well as purchase any or all of the four leased hospital properties at their appraised fair market value upon one month s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur.
352915_12_ITEM1_P79_S3	On May 19, 2011, certain of our subsidiaries provided the required notice to the Trust exercising the 5-year renewal options on McAllen Medical Center, Wellington Regional Medical Center and Southwest Healthcare System, Inland Valley Campus which extended the lease terms to December, 2016.
352915_12_ITEM1_P79_S4	The table below details the renewal options and terms for each of our four hospital facilities leased from the Trust, giving effect to the above-mentioned renewals:
352915_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	(a) We have three 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).
352915_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	The executive officers, whose terms will expire at such time as their successors are elected, are as follows:
352915_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	Senior Vice President, President of Acute Care Division Mr. Alan B. Miller has been Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since inception and also served as President from inception until May, 2009.
352915_12_ITEM1_P82_S1	Prior thereto, he was President, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of American Medicorp, Inc.
352915_12_ITEM1_P82_S2	He currently serves as Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of Universal Health Realty Income Trust.
352915_12_ITEM1_P82_S3	Mr. Miller also serves as a Director of Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company.
352915_12_ITEM1_P82_S4	He is the father of Marc D. Miller, President and Director.
352915_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	Mr. Marc D. Miller was elected President in May, 2009 and prior thereto served as Senior Vice President and co-head of our Acute Care Hospitals since 2007.
352915_12_ITEM1_P83_S1	He was elected a Director in May, 2006 and Vice President in 2005.
352915_12_ITEM1_P83_S2	He has served in various capacities related to our acute care division since 2000.
352915_12_ITEM1_P83_S3	He was elected to the Board of Trustees of Universal Health Realty Income Trust in December, 2008.
352915_12_ITEM1_P83_S4	He is the son of Alan B. Miller, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.
352915_12_ITEM1_P83_S5	Mr. Filton was elected Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in 2003 and he was elected Secretary in 1999.
352915_12_ITEM1_P83_S6	He had served as Vice President and Controller since 1991 and Director of Corporate Accounting since 1985.
352915_12_ITEM1_P83_S7	Ms. Osteen was elected Senior Vice President in 2005 and serves as President of our Behavioral Health Care Division.
352915_12_ITEM1_P83_S8	She was elected Vice President in 2000 and has served in various capacities related to our Behavioral Health Care facilities since 1984.
352915_12_ITEM1_P83_S9	Mr. Pember commenced employment with us in August, 2011 and serves as President of our Acute Care Division.
352915_12_ITEM1_P83_S10	He was formerly employed for 12 years at Indiana University Health, Inc. (formerly known as Clarian Health Partners, Inc.), a nonprofit hospital system that operates 16 facilities in Indiana, where he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also impact our business and results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	A significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in Nevada, Texas and California.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We own 6 acute care hospitals and 4 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Properties (we owned two additional behavioral health facilities which were acquired by us from PSI in November, 2010 before the facilities were divested during the third and fourth quarters of 2011 pursuant to our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, as discussed herein).
352915_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 18% in 2011, 23% in 2010 and 24% in 2009 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 11% in 2011, 15% in 2010 and 14% in 2009 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We own 8 acute care hospitals and 14 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 18% in 2011, 19% in 2010 and 20% in 2009 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 14% in 2011, 15% in 2010 and 16% in 2009 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	California: We own 4 acute care hospitals and 15 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 10% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2011, 2010 and 2009.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 5% in 2011, 4% in 2010 and 5% in 2009 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	The significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative, regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in Nevada, Texas and California.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We derive a significant portion of our revenue from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If the rates paid or the scope of services covered by government payors are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $100 million annually from each of Texas, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Illinois and Washington, D.C., making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective 2012 state fiscal years) as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In the states in which we operate, based upon the state budgets for the 2012 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2011), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates have been reduced by approximately 3% to 4% (or approximately $45 million to $55 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states 2011 fiscal years (which generally ended during the third quarter of 2011).
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 include the pro rata portion of these Medicaid rate reductions.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S6	We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues (which have been proposed in certain states for fiscal year 2013), particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S7	In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors, including managed care providers, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Private payors, including managed care providers, increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S9	We expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S10	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S11	A worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S12	Our patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance, which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S13	A continuation or worsening of economic conditions may result in a continued increase in the unemployment rate which will likely increase the number of individuals without health insurance.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S14	As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or a significant increase in services provided to uninsured patients.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P5_S15	These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our patient revenues and payor mix during the last few years were adversely affected by economic conditions, particularly in certain markets, such as Nevada, Texas and California, where a significant portion of our revenues are concentrated and unemployment rates remain high.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	of uninsured and underinsured patients treated at our facilities.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We can provide no assurance that these trends will not continue.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	During 2011, our revenues and payor mix within our acute care operations have been volatile making it difficult to predict the results for 2012 or thereafter.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, we recorded approximately $1.92 billion of goodwill as a result of our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, and, as of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $2.63 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Should the revenues and financial results of our acute care and/or behavioral health care facilities be materially, unfavorably impacted due to, among other things, a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates, a continued rise in the unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Reductions or changes in Medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The 2011 Act provides for new spending on program integrity initiatives intended to reduce fraud and abuse under the Medicare program.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the Joint Committee ), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented which, if triggered, would result in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs starting in 2013.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We cannot predict whether Congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the automatic budget cuts or what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA ).
352915_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Reconciliation Act ), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the Legislation ), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Although it is expected that as a result of the Legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients, which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable, the Legislation makes a number of other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Legislation revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The Legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning October 1, 2011 for Medicare Part B reimbursable items and services and beginning October 1, 2012 for Medicare inpatient hospital services.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The Legislation will reduce Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in 2014, which would adversely impact the reimbursement we receive under these programs.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Legislation implements a value-based purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals may include those with excessive readmission or hospital-acquired condition rates.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The various provisions in the Legislation that directly or indirectly affect reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Legislation provisions are likely to be affected by the incomplete nature of implementing regulations or expected forthcoming interpretive guidance, gradual implementation, future legislation, and possible judicial nullification of all or certain provisions of the Legislation.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Further Legislation provisions, such as those creating the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, create certain flexibilities in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Thus, we cannot predict the impact of the Legislation on our future reimbursement at this time.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Legislation also contains provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Legislation amends several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	While Congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found guilty of violating such law, the Legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Legislation also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited, effective immediately, from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The impact of the Legislation on each of our hospitals may vary.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Because Legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years, we anticipate that many of the provisions in the Legislation may be subject to further revision or judicial nullification.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Moreover, a number of state attorneys general are challenging the legality of certain aspects of the Legislation.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Currently, rulings in separate Federal District Courts regarding the constitutionality of the Legislation have been split.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	These decisions are in the process of being appealed to the United States Supreme Court.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	We cannot predict the impact the Legislation may have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity, the ultimate outcome of the judicial rulings or whether we will be able to successfully adapt to the changes required by the Legislation.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	We are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P18_S7	In accordance with our internal policies and procedures, as well as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical treatment (whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P18_S8	If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition, we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient s medical condition, within the facility s capability, or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital s written procedures.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Our obligations under EMTALA may increase substantially going forward; CMS has recently sought stakeholder comments concerning the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P18_S10	If the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly, or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under EMTALA is proposed and adopted, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price, patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In recent years, the number of quality measures that hospitals are required to report publicly has increased.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	CMS publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the Medicare program.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Additionally, the Legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish, update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If any of our hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys (or results that are lower than our competitors) or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volume could decline because patients may elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	This circumstance could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	An increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Collection of receivables from third-party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and deductibles.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S7	However, we also have substantial receivables due to us as of December 31, 2011 (a significant portion of which is past due) from certain state-based funding programs, most particularly Illinois.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S8	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables, historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S9	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Significant changes in business office operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S11	If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P21_S13	The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals, and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	As a result, most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	As a result, the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	of our hospitals, and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	They may terminate their affiliation with us at any time.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	It may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals are located.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Generally, the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P25_S6	The loss of one or more of these physicians, even if temporary, could cause a material reduction in our revenues, which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment, our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The technology used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and, as a result, manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	To compete effectively, we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry, patients may seek treatment from other providers and/or physicians may refer their patients to alternate sources, which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If we fail to effectively and timely implement electronic health record systems, our operations could be harmed.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	As required by HITECH, we are in the process of developing and implementing an incentive payment program for eligible hospitals and health care professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P27_S5	If our facilities or physicians are unable to meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing an electronic health record system.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Further, beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, eligible hospitals and professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology will be subject to reduced payments from Medicare.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Any failure by us to effectively implement an electronic health record system in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P28_S5	This shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P28_S6	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P28_S7	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets, which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P28_S8	We cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things: hospital billing practices and prices for services; relationships with physicians and other referral sources; adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services; ownership of facilities; qualifications of medical and support personnel; confidentiality, maintenance, privacy and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our facilities; operating policies and procedures, and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Among these laws are the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the federal anti-kickback statute and the provision of the Social Security Act commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	These laws, and particularly the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P30_S4	We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	A number of our current arrangements, including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	CMS recently published a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol, which is intended to allow providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark law.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the Stark law, there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the Stark law or that self-disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Federal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that require us to implement and, in the future, may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient s health and related financial information.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Such privacy and security regulations impose extensive administrative, physical and technical requirements on us, restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information, provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	These laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	In the future, it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P33_S4	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws (see Item 3-Legal Proceedings ), or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P33_S5	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P33_S6	See Item 1 Business Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation .
352915_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Some of these actions may involve large claims, as well as significant defense costs.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	All professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We believe that, based on our past experience and actuarial estimates, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	While we continuously monitor our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P35_S3	If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We may be subject to governmental investigations, regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits The federal False Claims Act permits private parties to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits against companies.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	All of our hospitals are deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P39_S5	However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Our level of indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of PSI could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Our level of indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of PSI could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could potentially prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P39_S8	In connection with the consummation of our acquisition of PSI, in addition to previously existing outstanding debt commitments and undertaking a $250 million offering of notes in September, 2010, we obtained a debt financing commitment of $3.45 billion under a senior credit facility consisting of an $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion term loan A facility and a $1.6 billion term loan B facility.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P39_S9	The senior credit facility became effective upon closing of the acquisition of PSI, which occurred in November, 2010.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P39_S10	We also obtained an amended $240 million accounts receivable securitization facility during 2010 (increased from $200 million).
352915_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	debt was $3.65 billion and we had $482 million of unused borrowing capacity under our senior credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities, after taking into account $69 million of outstanding letters of credit and $9 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to our short-term, on-demand note.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility, the indenture that governs the notes and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our leverage could result in unfavorable impact on us, including the following:
352915_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our growth strategy depends, in part, on acquisitions, and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not-for-profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit healthcare companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Also, suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that affect the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a healthcare facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation, increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals, increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria, any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital s results of operations, allocation of the purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P42_S6	We may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire, which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P42_S7	We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by acquired hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P43_S3	If we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire, operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals, our results of operations could be harmed.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P43_S4	If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P43_S7	Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility s reputation could harm our business.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P43_S8	Our subsidiary, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P43_S9	Our subsidiary, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions (see Item 3-Legal Proceedings ).
352915_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted Certificates of Need, or CON, laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization review, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Fluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future, the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S3	In addition to our operating results, many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S4	These factors include certain of the risks discussed herein, demographic changes, operating results of other hospital companies, changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts, speculation in the press or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, managed care contract negotiations and terminations, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S5	We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S6	As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S7	While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S8	For example, we cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S9	We also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S10	If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S11	If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S12	A cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of member privacy, or other negative impacts.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S13	A cyber-attack that bypasses our information technology ( IT ) security systems causing an IT security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws, loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption of our IT business systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S14	In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of public health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S15	Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S16	Generally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S17	Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P48_S18	Differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, we have a commitment with an unrelated third party to build a newly constructed facility with a specified minimum number of beds and services.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P50_S4	The deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P50_S5	We require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P50_S6	We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P50_S7	We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	To fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P52_S3	We depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P52_S4	The expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P52_S5	The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities, which could harm our business.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	At December 31, 2011, 31.2 million shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P53_S3	To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In addition, from time-to-time our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Conversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The right to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P55_S2	As of March 31, 2011, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 7.5% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect six members of the Board of Directors and constituted 87.2% of our general voting power.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P55_S3	As of March 31, 2011, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options) constituted 92.5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 12.8% of our general voting power.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P55_S4	As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P55_S5	Each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).
352915_12_ITEM1A_P55_S6	In the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock, which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P55_S7	The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P55_S8	Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his family who are also directors and officers of our company, and they can elect a majority of our company s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.
352915_12_ITEM1A_P55_S9	In addition, because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.
352915_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	We own office buildings in King of Prussia and Wayne, Pennsylvania and Brentwood, Tennessee.
352915_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) Desert Springs Hospital, Summerlin Hospital Medical Center, Valley Hospital Medical Center, Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center and Centennial Hills Hospital Medical Center are owned by limited liability companies ( LLCs ) in which we hold controlling, majority ownership interests of approximately 72%.
352915_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	The remaining minority ownership interests in these facilities are held by unaffiliated third-parties.
352915_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	All hospitals are managed by us.
352915_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	(2) We hold an 80% ownership interest in this facility through a general partnership interest in a limited partnership.
352915_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	The remaining 20% ownership interest is held by an unaffiliated third-party.
352915_12_ITEM2_P3_S0	(3) Real property leased from Universal Health Realty Income Trust.
352915_12_ITEM2_P4_S0	(4) In October, 2007, the licenses for Edinburg Regional Medical Center, Edinburg Children s Hospital, McAllen Medical Center, McAllen Heart Hospital and South Texas Behavioral Health Center were consolidated under one license operating as the South Texas Health System.
352915_12_ITEM2_P5_S0	(5) We manage and own a noncontrolling interest of approximately 50% in the entity that operates this facility.
352915_12_ITEM2_P6_S0	(6) We own a majority interest in an LLC that owns and operates this center.
352915_12_ITEM2_P7_S0	(7) We own minority interests in an LLC that owns and operates this center which is managed by a third-party.
352915_12_ITEM2_P8_S0	(8) We own a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 50% in the entity that operates this facility that is managed by a third-party.
352915_12_ITEM2_P9_S0	(9) We hold an 89% ownership interest in this facility through both general and limited partnership interests.
352915_12_ITEM2_P9_S1	The remaining 11% ownership interest is held by unaffiliated third parties.
352915_12_ITEM2_P10_S0	(10) These facilities were acquired by us in November, 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI.
352915_12_ITEM2_P10_S1	We own or lease medical office buildings adjoining some of our hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM2_P10_S2	We believe that the leases on the facilities, medical office buildings and other real estate leased or owned by us do not impose any material limitation on our operations.
352915_12_ITEM2_P10_S3	The aggregate lease payments on facilities leased by us were $55 million in 2011, $45 million in 2010 and $41 million in 2009.
352915_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	Justice ( DOJ ) and the Virginia Attorney General intervened in a qui tam case that had been filed by former employees of Marion Youth Center under seal in 2007 against Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ), and Keystone Marion, LLC ( Marion ) and Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC ( Keystone ).
352915_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The intervention by the DOJ followed the issuance of a series of subpoenas from the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services seeking documents related to the treatment of Medicaid beneficiaries at Marion.
352915_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	The amended complaint filed by the DOJ and Virginia Attorney General alleged causes of action pursuant to the federal and state false claims acts and the Virginia fraud statute.
352915_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	The former employees filed a separate amended complaint alleging employment and retaliation claims as well as false claim act violations.
352915_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	During the third quarter of 2011, we reached an agreement in principle to settle all of the claims.
352915_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our results of operations for any of the periods presented herein.
352915_12_ITEM3_P1_S4	Should we be unable to finalize a definitive settlement agreement in this matter, we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously against the government s and the former employees allegations.
352915_12_ITEM3_P1_S5	There can be no assurance that we will prevail should this matter be litigated.
352915_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	Martin v. UHS of Delaware: UHS of Delaware, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, has been named as defendants in a state False Claim Act case in Sacramento County Superior Court.
352915_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	Plaintiffs are a former student and employees of the Elmira School who claim that the UHS schools in California unlawfully retained public education funding from the state of California for the operation of these schools but failed to meet state requirements pertaining to the operation of non-public schools.
352915_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	We deny liability and intend to defend this case vigorously.
352915_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	Department of Justice ICD Investigation: In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICDs ) from 2003 to the present at several of our acute care facilities.
352915_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Claims Determination regarding these devices.
352915_12_ITEM3_P3_S2	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital: On April 11, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) issued notice of its decision terminating Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital ( Two Rivers ) in Kansas City, Missouri from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid program.
352915_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	The termination notice was issued as a result of surveys conducted which allegedly found Two Rivers to be out of compliance with the conditions of participation required for participation in the Medicare program and for Two Rivers alleged failure to alleviate an immediate jeopardy situation.
352915_12_ITEM3_P5_S0	Two Rivers filed an administrative appeal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeal Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review and reversal of that decision.
352915_12_ITEM3_P5_S1	In addition, Two Rivers filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against CMS rescinding the termination action.
352915_12_ITEM3_P5_S2	On April 22, 2011, the District Court issued a temporary restraining order abating the termination action pending a preliminary injunction hearing or an agreement with CMS.
352915_12_ITEM3_P5_S3	On May 17, 2011, Two Rivers and CMS entered into a settlement agreement which resulted in the rescission of the termination notice and actions by CMS.
352915_12_ITEM3_P5_S4	Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Two Rivers was required to submit an acceptable plan of correction relative to the immediate jeopardy citation and engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for Two Rivers to meet the applicable Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_12_ITEM3_P6_S0	CMS will conduct an initial survey of Two Rivers, expected to occur in early 2012, to determine if the Medicare conditions of participation have been met.
352915_12_ITEM3_P6_S1	During the term of this agreement, Two Rivers remains eligible to receive reimbursements for services rendered to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
352915_12_ITEM3_P7_S0	Two Rivers remains fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the community it serves.
352915_12_ITEM3_P7_S1	We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with CMS in an effort to resolve these matters.
352915_12_ITEM3_P7_S2	We can provide no assurance that Two Rivers will not ultimately lose its Medicare certification.
352915_12_ITEM3_P7_S3	The operating results of Two Rivers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2011 or 2010.
352915_12_ITEM3_P8_S0	The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition of PSI which was completed in November, 2010: Garden City Employees Retirement System v. PSI: This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws.
352915_12_ITEM3_P8_S1	We intend to defend the case vigorously.
352915_12_ITEM3_P8_S2	Should we be deemed liable in this matter, we believe we would be entitled to commercial insurance recoveries for amounts paid by us, subject to certain limitations and deductibles.
352915_12_ITEM3_P8_S3	Included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011, is an estimated reserve (current liability) and corresponding commercial insurance recovery (current asset) which did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM3_P8_S4	Although we believe the commercial insurance recoveries are adequate to satisfy potential liability in this matter, we can provide no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the commercial insurance recoveries which would make us liable for the excess.
352915_12_ITEM3_P9_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Sierra Vista: In 2009, Sierra Vista Hospital in Sacramento, California learned of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) relating to Medicare services provided by the facility.
352915_12_ITEM3_P9_S1	The DOJ ultimately notified the facility that with respect to partial hospitalization and outpatient services, the DOJ believed that the medical record documentation did not adequately support the claims submitted for reimbursement by Medicare.
352915_12_ITEM3_P9_S2	We reached a tentative financial settlement with the DOJ which is subject to the negotiation of a definitive settlement agreement.
352915_12_ITEM3_P9_S3	As part of that agreement, the facility will be subject to a corporate integrity agreement.
352915_12_ITEM3_P9_S4	The reserve established in connection with this matter did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM3_P10_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_12_ITEM3_P11_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_12_ITEM3_P11_S1	The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_12_ITEM3_P11_S2	Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July 2011 requesting additional documents.
352915_12_ITEM3_P11_S3	Those documents are being collected and will be provided to the DOJ.
352915_12_ITEM3_P11_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_12_ITEM3_P12_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_12_ITEM3_P12_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_12_ITEM3_P12_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ and we continue to cooperate with the DOJ with respect to this investigation.
352915_12_ITEM3_P12_S3	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_12_ITEM3_P13_S0	Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims: The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services ( DMAS ) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state s Medicaid Provider Services Manual ( Manual ).
352915_12_ITEM3_P13_S1	As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities.
352915_12_ITEM3_P13_S2	PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending.
352915_12_ITEM3_P13_S3	The aggregate refund of Medicaid payments made to those facilities, as requested by DMAS, and the corresponding reserve established on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM3_P14_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse.
352915_12_ITEM3_P14_S1	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
352915_12_ITEM3_P14_S2	Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_12_ITEM3_P14_S3	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_12_ITEM3_P15_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_12_ITEM3_P15_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_12_ITEM3_P15_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein.
352915_12_ITEM3_P15_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_12_ITEM3_P15_S4	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_12_ITEM3_P15_S5	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_12_ITEM3_P15_S6	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_12_ITEM3_P15_S7	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.
352915_12_ITEM3_P15_S8	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_12_ITEM3_P15_S9	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class B Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
352915_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	Shares of our Class A, Class C and Class D Common Stock are not traded in any public market, but are each convertible into shares of our Class B Common Stock on a share-for-share basis.
352915_12_ITEM5_P0_S2	In November, 2009, we declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend which was paid on December 15, 2009 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2009.
352915_12_ITEM5_P0_S3	All classes of common stock participated on a pro rata basis and, as required, all references to share quantities and share prices for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

352915_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	Stock Repurchase Programs In various prior years, our Board of Directors has approved stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our outstanding Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market.
352915_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	There is no expiration date for our stock repurchase programs.

352915_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	Prior to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement Amendment in March, 2011 (as discussed below), we prepaid the principal amount and permanently reduced the Term Loan B commitment by $125 million.

352915_12_ITEM7_P21_S5	The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit.
352915_12_ITEM7_P21_S6	The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
352915_12_ITEM7_P21_S7	On March 15, 2011, we entered into a first amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment ) which became effective immediately and provides, among other things, for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
352915_12_ITEM7_P21_S8	Upon the effectiveness of the Amendment, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election (1) the greatest of (a) the lender s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month Eurodollar rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and Term Loan A borrowings and 1.75% to 2.00% for Term Loan B borrowings or (2) the one, two, three or six month Eurodollar rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit and Term Loan A borrowings and ranging from 2.75% to 3.00% for Term Loan B borrowings.
352915_12_ITEM7_P21_S9	The current applicable margins are 0.75% for ABR-based loans, 1.75% for Eurodollar-based loans under the revolving credit and Term Loan A facilities and 2.75% under the Term Loan B facility.
352915_12_ITEM7_P21_S10	Upon the effectiveness of the Amendment, the minimum Eurodollar rate for the Term Loan B facility was reduced from 1.50% to 1.00%.
352915_12_ITEM7_P21_S11	In connection with the Amendment, we paid a fee of 1.00% of the amounts outstanding under the Term Loan B in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
352915_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	In October, 2010, we amended our accounts receivable securitization program ( Securitization ) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	We increased the size of the Securitization to $240 million (the Commitments ), from $200 million, and extended the maturity date to October 25, 2013.
352915_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals ( Receivables ) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings.
352915_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	The interest rate on the borrowings is based on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of 0.475% and there is a facility fee of 0.375% required on 102% on the Commitments.
352915_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings.
352915_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us.
352915_12_ITEM7_P23_S4	The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities.
352915_12_ITEM7_P23_S5	The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_12_ITEM7_P23_S6	The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans.
352915_12_ITEM7_P23_S7	At December 31, 2011, we had $240 million of outstanding borrowings and no additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_12_ITEM7_P23_S8	As of December 31, 2011, we had $9 million outstanding borrowings under a short-term, on-demand credit facility.
352915_12_ITEM7_P23_S9	Outstanding borrowings, if any, pursuant to this facility are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since they can be refinanced through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement.
352915_12_ITEM7_P23_S10	As of December 31, 2011, we had an aggregate of $482 million of available borrowing capacity pursuant to the terms of our Credit Agreement and Securitization, net of $69 million of outstanding letters of credit and $9 million of outstanding borrowings under a short-term, on-demand credit facility.

352915_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	We exclude the $292 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments.
352915_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	Please see Self-Insured Risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.
352915_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	In connection with five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain put rights , that are currently exercisable, that if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member s interests at fair market value.
352915_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.
352915_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	In connection with a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the PSI acquisition, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities approximates the $218 million aggregate book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests.
352915_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	We exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these minority ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertainty as to: (i) whether or not the put rights will actually be exercised; (ii) the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were exercised, and; (iii) the timing of such payments.
352915_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	Additionally, the table above does not include $7 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be utilized.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2011 and 2010 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	We also determined that no portion of the hedges is ineffective and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	However, at December 31, 2011, each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S2	We do not anticipate nonperformance by those counterparties.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S3	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S4	During the first quarter of 2011, we entered into an interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $275 million whereby we paid a premium of $30,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 2.25% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 2.25% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S5	The three-month LIBOR never reached 2.25% during the term of the cap.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S6	Therefore, no payment was made to us.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S7	We also entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $450 million from December, 2011 to December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December, 2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S8	If the three-month LIBOR does not reach 7.00% during the term of the cap, no payment is made to us.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S9	We also entered into six additional forward starting interest rate swaps in the first quarter of 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $425 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S10	Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S11	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 1.91%.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P5_S12	The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $100 million, $25 million and $75 million became effective in December, 2011 and have fixed rates of 2.50%, 1.96% and 1.32%, and maturity dates in December, 2014, December, 2013 and December, 2012, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, we entered into three interest rate caps on a total notional amount of $1 billion whereby we paid a premium of $240,000 in exchange for the counterparties agreeing to pay the difference between 2.25% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 2.25% during the term of the caps.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	All of these caps expired in December, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The three-month LIBOR rate never rose above 2.25% during the term of the caps.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P6_S3	Therefore, no payments were made to us.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P6_S4	We also entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of 2010 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $600 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P6_S5	Each of the four swaps became effective in December, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P6_S6	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of $150 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Each of the two interest rate swaps had an initial notional principal amount of $75 million.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The notional amount of the first interest rate swap reduced to $50 million in October, 2010.The fixed rate payable is 4.76% and it matures in October, 2012.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P7_S3	The fixed rate payable on the second interest rate swap was 4.87% and it matured in October, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P8_S2	We consider those inputs to be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $48 million at December 31, 2011, of which $4 million is included in other current liabilities and $44 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $10 million at December 31, 2010, of which $2 million is included in other current liabilities and $8 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P10_S1	For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.
352915_12_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Ending December 31 (Dollars in thousands) As calculated based upon our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011 that is subject to interest rate fluctuations, each 1% change in interest rates would impact our pre-tax income by approximately $30 million.
352915_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, are included elsewhere herein.

352915_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the SEC rules thereunder.
352915_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the fourth quarter of 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
352915_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over our financial reporting.
352915_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria on Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
352915_12_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Based on its assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the COSO.

352915_12_ITEM15_P13_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Health Services, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
352915_12_ITEM15_P13_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P13_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_12_ITEM15_P13_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, financial statement schedule, and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included under item 9A as Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
352915_12_ITEM15_P13_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
352915_12_ITEM15_P13_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
352915_12_ITEM15_P13_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
352915_12_ITEM15_P13_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
352915_12_ITEM15_P13_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
352915_12_ITEM15_P13_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
352915_12_ITEM15_P13_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
352915_12_ITEM15_P14_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_12_ITEM15_P14_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P14_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P14_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

352915_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1) BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Services provided by our hospitals, all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.
352915_12_ITEM15_P22_S1	We, through our subsidiaries, provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	The more significant accounting policies follow: A) Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner.
352915_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
352915_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 37% of our net patient revenues during 2011 and 38% of our net patient revenues during each of 2010 and 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P24_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 43% of our net patient revenues during 2011 and 46% during each of 2010 and 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P24_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_12_ITEM15_P24_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_12_ITEM15_P24_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_12_ITEM15_P24_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P24_S7	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_12_ITEM15_P24_S8	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P25_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_12_ITEM15_P25_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P25_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_12_ITEM15_P26_S1	As such, we can not provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P26_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2011, 2010 or 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_12_ITEM15_P27_S2	Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $956 million, $807 million and $671 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	C) Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_12_ITEM15_P28_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_12_ITEM15_P28_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_12_ITEM15_P28_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_12_ITEM15_P28_S6	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_12_ITEM15_P28_S7	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of at least 20% of total charges.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	During the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay balances outstanding for greater than 60 days from the date of discharge.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	All self-pay accounts at the hospital level are fully reserved if they have been outstanding for greater than 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S2	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S3	Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S4	As of December 31, 2011, our accounts receivable includes $54 million due from Illinois, the collection of which has been delayed due to budgetary and funding pressures experienced by the state.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S5	Although approximately $41 million of the receivables due from Illinois have been outstanding in excess of 60 days (as of December 31, 2011), and a large portion will likely remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us and therefore no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S6	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S7	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S8	On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S9	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $253 million and $249 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S10	D) Concentration of Revenues: Our five majority owned acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined basis, 16% in 2011, 21% in 2010 and 22% in 2009, of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_12_ITEM15_P30_S11	On a combined basis, our facilities in the McAllen/Edinburg, Texas market (consisting of three acute care facilities, a children s hospital and a behavioral health facility) contributed 5% in 2011, 6% in 2010 and 7% in 2009, of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	E) Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
352915_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	F) Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost.
352915_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	Expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts.
352915_12_ITEM15_P31_S3	Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred.
352915_12_ITEM15_P31_S4	We remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	Construction-in-progress includes both construction projects and equipment not yet placed into service.
352915_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	We capitalize interest expense on major construction projects while in progress.
352915_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	We capitalized interest on major construction projects amounting to $400,000 during 2011, $7.6 million during 2010 and $11.6 million during 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years).
352915_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	Depreciation expense (excluding discontinued operations) was $268.5 million during 2011, $202.8 million during 2010 and $184.6 million during 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	G) Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_12_ITEM15_P34_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_12_ITEM15_P34_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	We have designated September 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2011 which indicated no impairment of goodwill.
352915_12_ITEM15_P35_S3	There were also no goodwill impairments during 2010 or 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P35_S4	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill.
352915_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	(a) The reduction to the Behavioral Health Services goodwill consists primarily of a reclassification to assets of facilities held for sale and represents the goodwill attributable to a legacy facility which we agreed to divest pursuant to our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission.
352915_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	Other Assets: Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010 consisting of Medicare licenses, certificates of need and contracts to manage the operations of behavioral health services owned by third-parties; (ii) prepaid fees for various software and other applications used by our hospitals; (iii) costs incurred in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities; (iv) deposits; (v) investments in various businesses, including Universal Health Realty Income Trust; (vi) the invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related payable included in other noncurrent liabilities; (vii) the estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and; (viii) other miscellaneous assets.
352915_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $97 million and $100 million, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Pursuant to contractual guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2011 that are applicable to future years, we have $6 million of potential future financial obligations of which $4 million are potential obligations during 2012 and $2 million are potential obligations during 2013 and later.
352915_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	K) Self-Insured Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_12_ITEM15_P40_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_12_ITEM15_P40_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_12_ITEM15_P40_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_12_ITEM15_P40_S5	See Note 8 for discussion of revisions to prior year general and professional liability reserves and self-insurance liability assumed in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010.
352915_12_ITEM15_P40_S6	Based on the results of workers compensation reserves analyses, we recorded reductions of prior year reserves of $4 million during 2010 and $7 million during 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P40_S7	Adjustments to prior year workers compensation reserves did not have a material impact on our 2011 consolidated financial statements or results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	L) Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_12_ITEM15_P42_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_12_ITEM15_P43_S2	See Note 6 for additional disclosure regarding income taxes.
352915_12_ITEM15_P43_S3	Other Noncurrent Liabilities: Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general liability, workers compensation reserves, pension and deferred compensation liabilities, liability incurred in connection with split-dollar life insurance agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife and interest rate swap liabilities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P43_S4	Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest:
352915_12_ITEM15_P43_S5	Outside owners hold noncontrolling, minority ownership interests of: (i) approximately 28% in our five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada; (ii) 20% in an acute care facility located in Washington, D.C.; (iii) approximately 11% in an acute care facility located in Laredo, Texas, and; (iv) 20% in a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the majority ownership interest of which was acquired by us as result of our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010.
352915_12_ITEM15_P43_S6	The redeemable noncontrolling interests balances of $218 million and $212 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and the noncontrolling interests balances of $51 million and $45 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, consist primarily of the third-party ownership interests in these hospitals.
352915_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	In connection with the five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain put rights , that are currently exercisable, that if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member s interests at fair market value.
352915_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.
352915_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_12_ITEM15_P45_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities approximates the book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests.
352915_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive income or loss is comprised of net income, changes in unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and a pension liability.
352915_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	The accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) component of stockholders equity includes: net unrealized gains and losses on effective cash flow hedges; and the net minimum pension liability of a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan which covers employees at one of our subsidiaries.
352915_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	See Note 10, Pension Plan for additional disclosure regarding the defined benefit pension plan.
352915_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	The amounts recognized in AOCI for the two years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows (in thousands): P) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities: We manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_12_ITEM15_P48_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_12_ITEM15_P48_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_12_ITEM15_P48_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within stockholders equity.
352915_12_ITEM15_P48_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_12_ITEM15_P49_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_12_ITEM15_P49_S3	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
352915_12_ITEM15_P49_S4	Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.
352915_12_ITEM15_P49_S5	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	Q) Stock-Based Compensation: At December 31, 2011, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans.
352915_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	Pursuant to the FASB s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
352915_12_ITEM15_P50_S2	The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge.
352915_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	The applicable FASB guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows.
352915_12_ITEM15_P51_S2	During 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no net excess tax benefits generated.
352915_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
352915_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.
352915_12_ITEM15_P52_S2	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated:
352915_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Net effect of dilutive stock options and grants based on the treasury stock method , for all years presented above, excludes certain outstanding stock options applicable to each year since the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
352915_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	The excluded weighted-average stock options totaled 1.4 million during 2011, 1,000 during 2010 and 3.6 million during 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	S) Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The fair values of our registered debt and investments are based on quoted market prices.
352915_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar maturities and credit quality.
352915_12_ITEM15_P54_S2	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
352915_12_ITEM15_P54_S3	Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	T) Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
352915_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
352915_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	U) Mergers and Acquisitions: The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions.
352915_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
352915_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
352915_12_ITEM15_P57_S2	Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred.
352915_12_ITEM15_P57_S3	The fair value of intangible assets, including Medicare Licenses, Certificates of Need, and certain contracts, is based on significant judgments made by our management, and accordingly, for significant items we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.
352915_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	No. 2011-07, Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities, which requires health care entities to change the presentation in their statement of operations by reclassifying the provision for bad debts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts).
352915_12_ITEM15_P58_S1	The guidance provided in this ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
352915_12_ITEM15_P58_S2	While this standard will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations, it will require us to reclassify our provision for doubtful accounts from operating expenses to a component of net revenues beginning with the first quarter of 2012, with retrospective application required.
352915_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	Measuring Charity Care for Disclosures: In August 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-23, Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Measuring Charity Care for Disclosure, which prescribes a specific measurement basis of charity care for disclosure.
352915_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	The guidance provided in this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010.
352915_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	A significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, amounting to $956 million during 2011 and $807 million during 2010.
352915_12_ITEM15_P62_S1	The estimated cost of providing the charity services was $173 million during 2011 and $158 million during 2010.
352915_12_ITEM15_P62_S2	The estimated costs were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned gross charity care and uninsured discount amounts.
352915_12_ITEM15_P62_S3	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities (excluding provision for doubtful accounts) divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P62_S4	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ( ASU 2010-06 ).
352915_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	ASU 2010-06 affects all entities that are required to make disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements under FASB ASC Topic 820, originally issued as FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements .
352915_12_ITEM15_P63_S2	This ASU requires certain new disclosures and clarifies two existing disclosure requirements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P63_S3	The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P63_S4	Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
352915_12_ITEM15_P63_S5	ASU No. 2010-06 did not have a significant impact on our disclosures.
352915_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	Presentation of Comprehensive Income: In June 2011, the FASB amended its guidance governing the presentation of comprehensive income.
352915_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	The amended guidance eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity.
352915_12_ITEM15_P64_S2	Under the new guidance, an entity can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate, but consecutive, statements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P64_S3	While the options for presenting other comprehensive income change under the guidance, other portions of the current guidance will not change.
352915_12_ITEM15_P64_S4	For public entities, these changes are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P64_S5	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	Multiemployer Pension Plan Disclosures: In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09 which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer s participation in multiemployer pension plans.
352915_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	The standard is intended to provide more information about an employer s financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates.
352915_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	This guidance is effective for fiscal 2011 year-end reporting.
352915_12_ITEM15_P65_S3	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our disclosures.
352915_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test for goodwill impairment.
352915_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required.
352915_12_ITEM15_P66_S2	Otherwise, no further testing is required.
352915_12_ITEM15_P66_S3	The revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P66_S4	However, an entity can choose to early adopt even if its annual test date is before the issuance of the final standard, provided that the entity has not yet performed its 2011 annual impairment test or issued its financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P66_S5	The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	Presentation of Insurance Claims and Related Insurance Recoveries: In August 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Updates ( ASU ) 2010-24, Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Presentation of Insurance Claims and Related Insurance Recoveries, which clarifies that a health care entity should not net insurance recoveries against a related claim liability.
352915_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	The guidance provided in this ASU is effective for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010.
352915_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P68_S1	2) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES Year ended December 31, 2011: 2011 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2011, we spent $29 million on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:
352915_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	The aggregate net cash expenditure related to the properties and/or businesses was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:
352915_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	2011 Divestitures of Assets and Businesses: During 2011, we received $68 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:
352915_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	the real property of a closed acute care hospital The operating results for the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are reflected as discontinued operations during 2011 and 2010 (from the November 15 th dates of acquisition).
352915_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our 2011 or 2010 consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.
352915_12_ITEM15_P71_S2	The aggregate pre-tax net gain on the divestitures of the above-mentioned facilities located in Delaware and Nevada did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P71_S3	In addition, also pursuant to our agreement with the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI, in January, 2012, we divested the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, a 108-bed facility located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.
352915_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	The pre-tax gain on the divestiture of the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, which will not have a material impact on our 2012 consolidated results of operations, will be reflected in our consolidated results of operations during the first quarter of 2012.
352915_12_ITEM15_P72_S2	The assets and liabilities for each of the above-mentioned facilities were reflected as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010.
352915_12_ITEM15_P72_S3	The following table shows the results of operations for the former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada, on a combined basis, which are reflected as discontinued operations (amounts in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2010: 2010 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2010, we spent $1.96 billion and assumed $1.08 billion of debt on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:
352915_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of an outpatient surgery center located in Florida in which we previously held a 20% minority ownership interest.
352915_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	The purchase price consideration in connection with this transaction, which occurred during the first quarter, consisted of acquisition of the net assets less the assumption of the outstanding liabilities and third-party debt.
352915_12_ITEM15_P73_S2	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows: Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price.
352915_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities: (i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.
352915_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	Assuming the acquisition of PSI occurred on January 1, 2009, our 2009 pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $7.01 billion and our pro forma net income attributable to UHS and pro form net income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $211 million and $2.14 per diluted share, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM15_P74_S2	The 2009 pro forma net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share include the after-tax impact of the transaction costs incurred by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI amounting to $79 million or $.81 per diluted share.
352915_12_ITEM15_P74_S3	Our 2010 pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $7.30 billion and our pro forma net income attributable to UHS and pro forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $342 million and $3.47 per diluted share, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM15_P74_S4	During the period of November 16, 2010 through December 31, 2010, the facilities acquired from PSI generated $227 million of net revenues which are included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010.
352915_12_ITEM15_P74_S5	The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the date of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, was not material to our 2010 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	2010 Divestitures of Assets and Businesses: During 2010, we received $21 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:
352915_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	the sale of the real property of Methodist Hospital located in Louisiana that was severely damaged and closed in 2005 as a result of Hurricane Katrina.
352915_12_ITEM15_P76_S1	The pre-tax gain, net of losses, resulting from the above-mentioned transactions did not have a material impact on our 2010 financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	Year ended December 31, 2009: 2009 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2009, we spent $12 million on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:
352915_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	the acquisition of the real property assets of a medical office building located on the campus of one of our acute care hospitals located in Texas.
352915_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:
352915_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	Assuming the acquisition of the behavioral health facility located in Colorado occurred on January 1, 2009, the pro forma effect on our 2009 net revenues, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per basic and diluted share, net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per basic and diluted share was immaterial.
352915_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	2009 Divestitures of Assets and Businesses: During 2009, we received $10 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:
352915_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	the sale of our ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center 3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges: During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we had no fair value hedges outstanding.
352915_12_ITEM15_P80_S1	Cash Flow Hedges: We manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_12_ITEM15_P80_S2	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_12_ITEM15_P81_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_12_ITEM15_P81_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within stockholders equity.
352915_12_ITEM15_P81_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_12_ITEM15_P82_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_12_ITEM15_P82_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2011 and 2010 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_12_ITEM15_P84_S2	We also determined that no portion of the hedges is ineffective and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	However, at December 31, 2011, each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties.
352915_12_ITEM15_P85_S2	We do not anticipate nonperformance by those counterparties.
352915_12_ITEM15_P85_S3	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
352915_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	During the first quarter of 2011, we entered into an interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $275 million whereby we paid a premium of $30,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 2.25% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 2.25% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	The three-month LIBOR never reached 2.25% during the term of the cap.
352915_12_ITEM15_P86_S2	Therefore, no payment was made to us.
352915_12_ITEM15_P86_S3	We also entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $450 million from December, 2011 to December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December, 2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap.
352915_12_ITEM15_P86_S4	If the three-month LIBOR does not reach 7.00% during the term of the cap, no payment is made to us.
352915_12_ITEM15_P86_S5	We also entered into six additional forward starting interest rate swaps in the first quarter of 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $425 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_12_ITEM15_P86_S6	Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_12_ITEM15_P86_S7	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 1.91%.
352915_12_ITEM15_P86_S8	The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $100 million, $25 million and $75 million became effective in December, 2011 and have fixed rates of 2.50%, 1.96% and 1.32%, and maturity dates in December, 2014, December, 2013 and December, 2012, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, we entered into three interest rate caps on a total notional amount of $1 billion whereby we paid a premium of $240,000 in exchange for the counterparties agreeing to pay the difference between 2.25% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 2.25% during the term of the caps.
352915_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	All of these caps expired in December, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P87_S2	The three-month LIBOR rate never rose above 2.25% during the term of the caps.
352915_12_ITEM15_P87_S3	Therefore, no payments were made to us.
352915_12_ITEM15_P87_S4	We also entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of 2010 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $600 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_12_ITEM15_P87_S5	Each of the four swaps became effective in December, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_12_ITEM15_P87_S6	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.
352915_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of $150 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	Each of the two interest rate swaps had an initial notional principal amount of $75 million.
352915_12_ITEM15_P88_S2	The notional amount of the first interest rate swap reduced to $50 million in October, 2010.The fixed rate payable is 4.76% and it matures in October, 2012.
352915_12_ITEM15_P88_S3	The fixed rate payable on the second interest rate swap was 4.87% and it matured in October, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis.
352915_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks.
352915_12_ITEM15_P89_S2	We consider those inputs to be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $48 million at December 31, 2011, of which $4 million is included in other current liabilities and $44 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.
352915_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $10 million at December 31, 2010, of which $2 million is included in other current liabilities and $8 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	4) LONG-TERM DEBT A summary of long-term debt follows: On November 15, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with various financial institutions.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	The Credit Agreement is a senior secured facility which provided an initial aggregate commitment amount of $3.45 billion, comprised of a new $800 million revolving credit facility, a $1.05 billion Term Loan A facility and a $1.6 billion Term Loan B facility.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S2	Prior to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement Amendment in March, 2011 (as discussed below), we prepaid the principal amount and permanently reduced the Term Loan B commitment by $125 million.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S3	During 2011, we made scheduled principal payments of $16 million on the Term Loan B and $26 million on the Term Loan A.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S4	The revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A mature on November 15, 2015 and the Term Loan B matures on November 15, 2016.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S5	The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S6	The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S7	On March 15, 2011, we entered into a first amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment ) which became effective immediately and provides, among other things, for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S8	Upon the effectiveness of the Amendment, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election (1) the greatest of (a) the lender s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month Eurodollar rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and Term Loan A borrowings and 1.75% to 2.00% for Term Loan B borrowings or (2) the one, two, three or six month Eurodollar rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit and Term Loan A borrowings and ranging from 2.75% to 3.00% for Term Loan B borrowings.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S9	The current applicable margins are 0.75% for ABR-based loans, 1.75% for Eurodollar-based loans under the revolving credit and Term Loan A facilities and 2.75% under the Term Loan B facility.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S10	Upon the effectiveness of the Amendment, the minimum Eurodollar rate for the Term Loan B facility was reduced from 1.50% to 1.00%.
352915_12_ITEM15_P91_S11	In connection with the Amendment, we paid a fee of 1.00% of the amounts outstanding under the Term Loan B in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
352915_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	In October, 2010, we amended our accounts receivable securitization program ( Securitization ) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	We increased the size of the Securitization to $240 million (the Commitments ), from $200 million, and extended the maturity date to October 25, 2013.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals ( Receivables ) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	The interest rate on the borrowings is based on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of 0.475% and there is a facility fee of 0.375% required on 102% on the Commitments.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S2	We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S3	We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S4	The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S5	The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S6	The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S7	At December 31, 2011, we had $240 million of outstanding borrowings and no additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S8	As of December 31, 2011, we had $9 million outstanding borrowings under a short-term, on-demand credit facility.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S9	Outstanding borrowings, if any, pursuant to this facility are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since they can be refinanced through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S10	As of December 31, 2011, we had an aggregate of $482 million of available borrowing capacity pursuant to the terms of our Credit Agreement and Securitization, net of $69 million of outstanding letters of credit and $9 million of outstanding borrowings under a short-term, on-demand credit facility.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S11	On September 29, 2010, we issued $250 million of 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the Unsecured Notes ) which are scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S12	The Unsecured Notes were registered in April, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S13	Interest on the Unsecured Note is payable semiannually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S14	The Unsecured Notes can be redeemed in whole at anytime subject to a make-whole call at treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to October 1, 2014.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S15	They are also redeemable in whole or in part at a price of: (i) 103.5% on or after October 1, 2014; (ii) 101.75% on or after October 1, 2015, and; (iii) 100% on or after October 1, 2016.
352915_12_ITEM15_P93_S16	These Unsecured Notes are guaranteed by a group of subsidiaries (each of which is a 100% directly owned subsidiary of Universal Health Services, Inc.) which fully and unconditionally guarantee the Unsecured Notes on a joint and several basis, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions.
352915_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the 7.125% Notes ).
352915_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year.
352915_12_ITEM15_P94_S2	In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of 7.125% Notes which formed a single series with the original 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2006.
352915_12_ITEM15_P94_S3	Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.
352915_12_ITEM15_P94_S4	During 2001, we issued $200 million of senior notes which have a 6.75% coupon rate and which matured and were paid in full on November 15, 2011 (the 6.75% Notes ).
352915_12_ITEM15_P94_S5	The interest on the 6.75% Notes was paid semiannually in arrears on May 15th and November 15th of each year.
352915_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	In connection with the entering into of the Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and in accordance with the Indenture dated January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2015) and our 6.75% Notes (which matured in November, 2011) were equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.
352915_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	The average amounts outstanding during 2011, 2010, and 2009 are under the current and prior Credit Agreements, demand notes and accounts receivable securitization programs were $2.9 billion, $610 million and $287 million, respectively, with corresponding interest rates of 3.4%, 3.4%, and 1.7% including commitment and facility fees.
352915_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	The maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end were $3.03 billion in 2011, $3.11 billion in 2010, and $356 million in 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P96_S2	The effective interest rate on our current and prior Credit Agreements, accounts receivable securitization programs, and demand notes, which includes the respective interest expense, commitment and facility fees, designated interest rate swaps expense and amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts, was 4.6% in 2011, 5.0% in 2010 and 3.9% in 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw.
352915_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates and dividends; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios.
352915_12_ITEM15_P97_S2	We are in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P97_S3	The carrying values of our debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are reflected above.
352915_12_ITEM15_P97_S4	The fair values of our debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $3.70 billion and $3.96, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM15_P97_S5	The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions.
352915_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	5) COMMON STOCK In November, 2009, we declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend which was paid on December 15, 2009 to stockholders of record as of December 1, 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	All classes of common stock participated on a pro rata basis and, as required, references to share quantities, share prices and earnings per share for all periods presented or discussed have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.
352915_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	Dividends Cash dividends of $.20 per share ($19 million in the aggregate) were declared and paid during each of 2011 and 2010, and $.17 per share ($17 million in the aggregate) were declared and paid during 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	Stock Repurchase Programs In various prior years, our Board of Directors has approved stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our outstanding Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market.
352915_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	There is no expiration date for our stock repurchase programs.
352915_12_ITEM15_P100_S2	The most recent approval occurred during 2007 at which time our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 10 million shares, a portion of which (as reflected below) remains available for purchase as of December 31, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P100_S3	The following schedule provides information related to our stock repurchase programs for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011:
352915_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	(a) During 2010 and 2009, there were 8,000 and 13,000, respectively, of restricted shares that were forfeited by former employees pursuant to the terms of our restricted stock purchase plan which are included in the total number of shares purchased.
352915_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	No such forfeitures occurred during 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	At December 31, 2011, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans.
352915_12_ITEM15_P102_S1	Pursuant to the FASB s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
352915_12_ITEM15_P102_S2	The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge.
352915_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P103_S1	The applicable FASB guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows.
352915_12_ITEM15_P103_S2	During 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no net excess tax benefits generated.
352915_12_ITEM15_P103_S3	Compensation costs related to outstanding stock options were recognized as follows: (i) a pre-tax charge of $15.8 million ($9.8 million after-tax) or $.10 per diluted share during 2011; (ii) a pre-tax charge of $13.3 million ($8.3 million after-tax) or $.08 per diluted share during 2010, and; (ii) $9.9 million ($6.2 million after-tax) or $.06 per diluted share during 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P103_S4	In addition, during the years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009, compensation costs of $2.0 million ($1.2 million after-tax), $3.1 million ($2.0 million after-tax) and$2.8 million ($1.8 million after-tax) , respectively, were recognized related to restricted stock.
352915_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	We adopted the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended in 2008 and 2010, (the Stock Incentive Plan ) which replaced our Amended and Restated 1992 Stock Option Plan which expired in July of 2005.
352915_12_ITEM15_P104_S1	An aggregate of twenty-three million shares of Class B Common Stock has been reserved under the Stock Incentive Plan.
352915_12_ITEM15_P104_S2	There were 2,747,500, 82,750 and 2,400,500 stock options, net of cancellations, granted during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM15_P104_S3	The per option weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2011, 2010 and 2009, was $11.62, $7.84 and $7.93, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	Stock options to purchase Class B Common Stock have been granted to our officers, key employees and directors under our above referenced stock option plans.
352915_12_ITEM15_P105_S1	All stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant.
352915_12_ITEM15_P105_S2	Options are exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year after the date of the grant.
352915_12_ITEM15_P105_S3	All outstanding options expire five years after the date of the grant.
352915_12_ITEM15_P105_S4	The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions derived from averaging the number of options granted during the most recent five-year period that were granted or have vestings after January 1, 2006.
352915_12_ITEM15_P105_S5	The 2009 weighted-average assumptions were based upon nineteen option grants, the 2010 weighted-average assumptions were based upon seventeen option grants and the 2011 weighted-average assumptions were based upon eighteen option grants.
352915_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon four year yield in effect at the time of grant.
352915_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	The expected life of the stock options granted was estimated using the historical behavior of employees.
352915_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	Expected volatility was based on historical volatility for a period equal to the stock option s expected life.
352915_12_ITEM15_P108_S1	Expected dividend yield is based on our actual dividend yield at the time of grant.
352915_12_ITEM15_P108_S2	The table below summarizes our stock option activity during each of the last three years:

352915_12_ITEM15_P124_S0	6) INCOME TAXES Components of income tax expense/(benefit) are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_12_ITEM15_P125_S0	Deferred taxes are required to be classified based on the financial statement classification of the related assets and liabilities which give rise to temporary differences.
352915_12_ITEM15_P126_S0	Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P126_S1	The components of deferred taxes are as follows (amounts in thousands): The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands): Impacting the effective tax rates during 2011 was approximately $1 million favorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions.
352915_12_ITEM15_P126_S2	Impacting the effective tax rates during 2010 were the following items: (i) $5 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust the non-deductible portion of certain transaction costs incurred during 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI; (ii) a $4 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust for the non-deductible, $9 million charge incurred from split-dollar life insurance agreements entered into during 2010 on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife, partially offset by; (iii) a $4 million favorable discrete tax item recorded during 2010 to adjust the estimated non-deductible portion of the previously disclosed South Texas Health System settlement with the government based upon the final agreement.
352915_12_ITEM15_P127_S0	A reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows: Included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are prepaid federal, foreign, and state income taxes amounting to approximately $25 million and $51 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM15_P127_S1	The net deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised as follows (amounts in thousands): The assets and liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible patient accounts, compensation-related accruals and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self- insurance reserves.
352915_12_ITEM15_P128_S0	At December 31, 2011, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2012 through 2031), and credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $881 million, representing approximately $44 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit).
352915_12_ITEM15_P128_S1	At December 31, 2011, related to the acquisition of PSI, there were federal net operating losses of approximately $2 million expiring in 2022 representing approximately $1 million in deferred federal tax benefits and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $8 million expiring through 2021 representing approximately $3 million in deferred foreign tax benefit.
352915_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
352915_12_ITEM15_P129_S1	Based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized.
352915_12_ITEM15_P129_S2	Therefore, valuation allowances of approximately $39 million and $28 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
352915_12_ITEM15_P129_S3	During 2011, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by approximately $11 million due to additional net operating losses incurred.
352915_12_ITEM15_P129_S4	In addition, valuation allowances of approximately $3 million and $4 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to foreign net operating losses.
352915_12_ITEM15_P130_S0	We adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007.
352915_12_ITEM15_P131_S0	penalties) were increased in the amount of approximately $1 million and $3 million, respectively, due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years.
352915_12_ITEM15_P131_S1	The increase in 2010 is primarily attributable to tax positions taken by PSI on pre-acquisition tax return years.
352915_12_ITEM15_P131_S2	Also during 2011, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately $2 million.
352915_12_ITEM15_P131_S3	The balance at each of December 31, 2011 and 2010, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately $5 million.
352915_12_ITEM15_P131_S4	We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.
352915_12_ITEM15_P131_S5	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we have approximately $1 million of accrued interest and penalties.
352915_12_ITEM15_P131_S6	The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2008 and subsequent years.
352915_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years.
352915_12_ITEM15_P132_S1	The statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months.
352915_12_ITEM15_P132_S2	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months however it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P132_S3	The tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows (amounts in thousands).
352915_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	7) LEASE COMMITMENTS Four of our hospital facilities are held under operating leases with Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms expiring in 2014 and 2016 (see Note 9 for additional disclosure).
352915_12_ITEM15_P133_S1	We also lease the real property of certain facilities acquired by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010 (see Item 2.
352915_12_ITEM15_P133_S2	A summary of property under capital lease follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as of December 31, 2011, are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_12_ITEM15_P134_S1	In the ordinary course of business, our facilities routinely lease equipment pursuant to month-to-month lease arrangements that will likely result in future lease rental expense in excess of the amounts indicated above.
352915_12_ITEM15_P134_S2	Capital lease obligations of $7.1 million in 2010 and $700,000 in 2009 were incurred when we assumed capital lease obligations upon the acquisition of facilities or entered into capital leases for new equipment.
352915_12_ITEM15_P134_S3	We incurred no additional capital lease obligations during 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Professional and General Liability Claims and Property Insurance Professional and General Liability Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence (as compared to $20 million per occurrence prior to 2008).
352915_12_ITEM15_P135_S1	Prior to our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_12_ITEM15_P135_S2	However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_12_ITEM15_P135_S3	Prior to our acquisition in November, 2010, the PSI subsidiaries were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a $3 million self-insured retention to a limit of $75 million.
352915_12_ITEM15_P135_S4	PSI utilized its captive insurance company and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of PSI to manage the self-insured retention for all former PSI subsidiaries for claims incurred prior to January 1, 2011.
352915_12_ITEM15_P135_S5	The captive insurance company also continues to manage the applicable self-insured retention for all professional and general liability claims, regardless of date incurred, for the former PSI subsidiaries located in Florida and Puerto Rico.
352915_12_ITEM15_P135_S6	Since our acquisition of PSI on November 15, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries (which are not former PSI subsidiaries) are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence.
352915_12_ITEM15_P135_S7	Effective November, 2010, our subsidiaries (including the former PSI subsidiaries) were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_12_ITEM15_P135_S8	We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_12_ITEM15_P136_S1	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_12_ITEM15_P136_S2	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P136_S3	As of December 31, 2011, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims, including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from PSI, was $292 million, of which $60 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P136_S4	As of December 31, 2010, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $289 million, of which $60 million is included in other current liabilities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P136_S5	Based upon the results of reserve analyses, we recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $11 million during 2011, $49 million during 2010 and $23 million during 2009.
352915_12_ITEM15_P136_S6	The favorable change recorded during 2011 consisted primarily of third-party recoveries and reserve reductions in connection with PHICO related claims which we became liable for upon PHICO s (a former commercial insurance carrier) liquidation in 2002.
352915_12_ITEM15_P136_S7	The favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2010 and 2009 were due to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 75% from 50%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 25% from 50%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years.
352915_12_ITEM15_P136_S8	As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends.
352915_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	We have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a $250,000 deductible.
352915_12_ITEM15_P137_S1	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_12_ITEM15_P137_S2	In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_12_ITEM15_P137_S3	Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented fault zones.
352915_12_ITEM15_P137_S4	Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_12_ITEM15_P137_S5	The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million.
352915_12_ITEM15_P137_S6	Flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.
352915_12_ITEM15_P137_S7	Our property insurance coverage is scheduled for renewal on June 1, 2012.
352915_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	Due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years, the cost of commercial property insurance has increased.
352915_12_ITEM15_P138_S1	As a result, catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_12_ITEM15_P138_S2	Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	Legal Proceedings U.S. v. Marion and UHS: In November, 2009, the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and the Virginia Attorney General intervened in a qui tam case that had been filed by former employees of Marion Youth Center under seal in 2007 against Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ), and Keystone Marion, LLC ( Marion ) and Keystone Education and Youth Services, LLC ( Keystone ).
352915_12_ITEM15_P139_S1	The intervention by the DOJ followed the issuance of a series of subpoenas from the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services seeking documents related to the treatment of Medicaid beneficiaries at Marion.
352915_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	The amended complaint filed by the DOJ and Virginia Attorney General alleged causes of action pursuant to the federal and state false claims acts and the Virginia fraud statute.

352915_12_ITEM15_P140_S2	During the third quarter of 2011, we reached an agreement in principle to settle all of the claims.
352915_12_ITEM15_P140_S3	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our results of operations for any of the periods presented herein.
352915_12_ITEM15_P140_S4	Should we be unable to finalize a definitive settlement agreement in this matter, we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously against the government s and the former employees allegations.

352915_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Claims Determination regarding these devices.
352915_12_ITEM15_P142_S2	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital: On April 11, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) issued notice of its decision terminating Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital ( Two Rivers ) in Kansas City, Missouri from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid program.
352915_12_ITEM15_P143_S1	The termination notice was issued as a result of surveys conducted which allegedly found Two Rivers to be out of compliance with the conditions of participation required for participation in the Medicare program and for Two Rivers alleged failure to alleviate an immediate jeopardy situation.
352915_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	Two Rivers filed an administrative appeal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeal Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review and reversal of that decision.
352915_12_ITEM15_P144_S1	In addition, Two Rivers filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against CMS rescinding the termination action.
352915_12_ITEM15_P144_S2	On April 22, 2011, the District Court issued a temporary restraining order abating the termination action pending a preliminary injunction hearing or an agreement with CMS.
352915_12_ITEM15_P144_S3	On May 17, 2011, Two Rivers and CMS entered into a settlement agreement which resulted in the rescission of the termination notice and actions by CMS.
352915_12_ITEM15_P144_S4	Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Two Rivers was required to submit an acceptable plan of correction relative to the immediate jeopardy citation and engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for Two Rivers to meet the applicable Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	CMS will conduct an initial survey of Two Rivers, expected to occur in early 2012, to determine if the Medicare conditions of participation have been met.
352915_12_ITEM15_P145_S1	During the term of this agreement, Two Rivers remains eligible to receive reimbursements for services rendered to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
352915_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	Two Rivers remains fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the community it serves.
352915_12_ITEM15_P146_S1	We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with CMS in an effort to resolve these matters.
352915_12_ITEM15_P146_S2	We can provide no assurance that Two Rivers will not ultimately lose its Medicare certification.
352915_12_ITEM15_P146_S3	The operating results of Two Rivers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2011 or 2010.

352915_12_ITEM15_P147_S4	Although we believe the commercial insurance recoveries are adequate to satisfy potential liability in this matter, we can provide no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the commercial insurance recoveries which would make us liable for the excess.

352915_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P152_S2	PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending.
352915_12_ITEM15_P152_S3	The aggregate refund of Medicaid payments made to those facilities, as requested by DMAS, and the corresponding reserve established on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse.
352915_12_ITEM15_P153_S1	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
352915_12_ITEM15_P153_S2	Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_12_ITEM15_P153_S3	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_12_ITEM15_P154_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_12_ITEM15_P154_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein.
352915_12_ITEM15_P154_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_12_ITEM15_P154_S4	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_12_ITEM15_P154_S5	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_12_ITEM15_P154_S6	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_12_ITEM15_P154_S7	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.
352915_12_ITEM15_P154_S8	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_12_ITEM15_P154_S9	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

352915_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our Mission Our mission and objective is to provide superior healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends, physicians prefer for their patients, purchasers select for their clients, employees are proud of, and investors seek for long-term results.
352915_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	To achieve this, we have a commitment to:
352915_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	innovation in service delivery Business Strategy We believe community-based hospitals will remain the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of self-determination for both the company and our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	We selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	We are committed to a program of rational growth around our core businesses, while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve.
352915_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P4_S4	We also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.
352915_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Improvement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.
352915_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	We also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.
352915_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	From time to time applications are filed with state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need, or CONs.
352915_13_ITEM1_P5_S4	Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.
352915_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible.
352915_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	We are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services.
352915_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures.
352915_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees, communities and our stockholders.
352915_13_ITEM1_P6_S4	In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	2012 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity: Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2012, we spent $528 million to acquire the following assets and businesses:

352915_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture, within approximately six months, of Peak Behavioral Health Services ( Peak ), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
352915_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	The revenues of Peak were approximately $18 million and $14 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	Divestitures: During 2012, we received $149 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:
352915_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	received an aggregate of $6 million for the sale of the real property of two non-operating behavioral health facilities and our majority ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center located in Puerto Rico.
352915_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	The aggregate pre-tax gain on the divestiture of Auburn was approximately $26 million and is included in our 2012 consolidated results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	The aggregate pre-tax gain on the divestiture of San Juan Capestrano in January, 2012 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2012.
352915_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Ascend Acquisition In October, 2012, we paid $503 million to acquire Ascend Health Corporation ( Ascend ) which owned or leased 9 freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities located in 5 states including Texas, Arizona, Utah, Oregon and Washington.
352915_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	At the time of the acquisition, Ascend was the largest private behavioral health care provider.
352915_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	The facilities acquired by us have an aggregate of approximately 800 licensed beds with additional capacity for approximately 65 beds currently being constructed.
352915_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility.
352915_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	Generally, we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians.
352915_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	Other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P12_S3	Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology.
352915_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors.
352915_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate.
352915_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	In addition, hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated.
352915_13_ITEM1_P13_S4	Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture.
352915_13_ITEM1_P13_S5	Information related to the behavioral health care facilities acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ), excluding 3 PSI facilities that were divested during 2011 pursuant to our agreement with the FTC, is included for the period of November 16, 2010 through December 31, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM1_P13_S6	The licensed and available beds for those facilities are included in 2010 on a weighted average basis for the period owned.
352915_13_ITEM1_P13_S7	Information related to the behavioral health care facilities acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation is included for the period of October 10, 2012 through December 31, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM1_P13_S8	The licensed and available beds for those facilities are included in 2012 on a weighted average basis for the period owned.
352915_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	(1) The statistical information for Auburn Regional Medical Center located in Washington (divested during the fourth quarter of 2012) and Central Montgomery Medical Center located in Pennsylvania (divested during the fourth quarter of 2008) is included in the above information through each respective divestiture date.
352915_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	(2) Average Available Beds is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available for patient care.
352915_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	(3) Patient Days is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.
352915_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	(4) Occupancy Rate is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of average beds, either available or licensed.
352915_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Sources of Revenue for additional disclosure.
352915_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Reporting.
352915_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self-referrals by physicians).
352915_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected.
352915_13_ITEM1_P19_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.
352915_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Licensing, Certification and Accreditation: All of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness.
352915_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments.
352915_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.
352915_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	All of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by the Joint Commission.
352915_13_ITEM1_P20_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P20_S5	If any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors.
352915_13_ITEM1_P20_S6	We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards.
352915_13_ITEM1_P20_S7	The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Certificates of Need: Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need ( CON ) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility s license, which could harm our business.
352915_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions.
352915_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Utilization Review: Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services.
352915_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	The law and regulations require Peer Review Organizations ( PROs ) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group ( DRG ) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay.
352915_13_ITEM1_P25_S2	PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program.
352915_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.
352915_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Audits: Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims.
352915_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights.
352915_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	The federal government contracts with third-party recovery audit contractors ( RACs ) and Medicaid integrity contractors ( MICs ), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers.
352915_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	The Recovery Audit Prepayment Review demonstration program will enable RACs to review claims before they are paid to ensure that the provider complied with all Medicare payment rules.
352915_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	Currently, the demonstration program is targeting states with high populations of fraud- and error-prone providers.
352915_13_ITEM1_P28_S3	Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors ( ZPICs ) target claims for potential fraud and abuse.
352915_13_ITEM1_P28_S4	Additionally, Medicare administrative contractors ( MACs ) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers.
352915_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years, the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial.
352915_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
352915_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation The Stark Law:
352915_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met.
352915_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	These types of referrals are known as self-referrals.
352915_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to $15,000 for each violation, up to $100,000 for sham arrangements, up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs.
352915_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart.
352915_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	This recent regulation also places a number of compliance requirements on physician-owned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest.
352915_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.
352915_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.
352915_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Anti-kickback Statute: A provision of the Social Security Act known as the anti-kickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program.
352915_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	However, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti-kickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law.
352915_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	The anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors, from the federal anti-kickback statute for various activities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services.
352915_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws.
352915_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Similar State Laws: Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care.
352915_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure.
352915_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes.
352915_13_ITEM1_P40_S3	However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
352915_13_ITEM1_P40_S4	These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_13_ITEM1_P40_S5	It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_13_ITEM1_P40_S6	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see Legal Proceedings ), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_13_ITEM1_P40_S7	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs.
352915_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations: A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the False Claims Act s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions.
352915_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.
352915_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	When a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim.
352915_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act.
352915_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government.
352915_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 ( FERA ) has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds.
352915_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	FERA also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments.
352915_13_ITEM1_P46_S3	In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act.
352915_13_ITEM1_P46_S4	Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court.
352915_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Recent changes to the False Claims Act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified, or by the date any corresponding cost report was due, whichever is later.
352915_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	Failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil False Claims Act liability.
352915_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions: The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud.
352915_13_ITEM1_P47_S4	Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.
352915_13_ITEM1_P47_S5	Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs.
352915_13_ITEM1_P47_S6	HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare.
352915_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.
352915_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:
352915_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH ), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically.
352915_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry.
352915_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information.
352915_13_ITEM1_P49_S3	The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed.
352915_13_ITEM1_P49_S4	Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.
352915_13_ITEM1_P49_S5	We believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of HIPAA, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance.
352915_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information.
352915_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements.
352915_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred.
352915_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	We believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date.
352915_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	Recent changes to the HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers, including expanded obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.
352915_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft.
352915_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010, signed on December 18, 2010, appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the Red Flags Rule, but permits the FTC or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the Red Flags Rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft.
352915_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	Compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future.
352915_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005: On July 29, 2005, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 was enacted, which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety.
352915_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	This legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report Patient Safety Work Product ( PSWP ) to Patient Safety Organizations ( PSOs ).
352915_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	Under the system, PSWP is made privileged, confidential and legally protected from disclosure.
352915_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	PSWP does not include medical, discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety.
352915_13_ITEM1_P53_S4	This legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute PSWP.
352915_13_ITEM1_P53_S5	PSOs are certified by the Secretary of the HHS for three-year periods and analyze PSWP, provide feedback to providers and may report non-identifiable PSWP to a database.
352915_13_ITEM1_P53_S6	In addition, PSOs are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies.
352915_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs.
352915_13_ITEM1_P54_S2	In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P54_S3	We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.
352915_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine: Several states, including Florida, Nevada, California and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services.
352915_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties.
352915_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable.
352915_13_ITEM1_P55_S3	These statutes and/or regulations vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.
352915_13_ITEM1_P55_S4	We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians.
352915_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.
352915_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	EMTALA: All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act ( EMTALA ).
352915_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	This federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition.
352915_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment.
352915_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay.
352915_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program.
352915_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.
352915_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions.
352915_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	CMS has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments.
352915_13_ITEM1_P60_S3	The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future.
352915_13_ITEM1_P60_S4	We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.
352915_13_ITEM1_P60_S5	Health Care Industry Investigations: We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation.
352915_13_ITEM1_P60_S6	Legal Proceedings included herein for additional disclosure.
352915_13_ITEM1_P60_S7	In addition, currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_13_ITEM1_P60_S8	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_13_ITEM1_P61_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P61_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.
352915_13_ITEM1_P61_S4	Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P61_S5	It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity.
352915_13_ITEM1_P61_S6	It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.
352915_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them.
352915_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.
352915_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	indigent health care within the state.
352915_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform: Medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level.
352915_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	All states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits.
352915_13_ITEM1_P64_S2	Over half of the states have limits on damages awards.
352915_13_ITEM1_P64_S3	Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits, and many states have established limits on attorney fees.
352915_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	Many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform.
352915_13_ITEM1_P65_S1	Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform, and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates.
352915_13_ITEM1_P65_S2	Reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.
352915_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	Compliance Program: Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998.
352915_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	Currently, the program s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program s policies.
352915_13_ITEM1_P66_S2	Since its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry s expectations and our needs.
352915_13_ITEM1_P66_S3	Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business.
352915_13_ITEM1_P66_S4	Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program.
352915_13_ITEM1_P66_S5	Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas.
352915_13_ITEM1_P66_S6	Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.
352915_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	Medical Staff and Employees Our facilities had approximately 65,100 employees on December 31, 2012, of whom approximately 46,000 were employed full-time.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	In a number of our markets, physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S2	Within our acute care division, approximately 120 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S3	Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S4	In addition, within our behavioral health division, approximately 360 psychiatrists are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S5	Each of our hospitals is managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of ours.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S6	In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S7	Approximately 1,500 of our employees at five of our hospitals are unionized.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S8	At Valley Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating Engineers and the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ).
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S9	Nurses and technicians at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the SEIU.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S10	At The George Washington University Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the SEIU or the Hospital Police Association.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S11	Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain technicians and therapists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S12	At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Teamsters and the Northwestern Nurses Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals.
352915_13_ITEM1_P68_S13	A union representation election was recently held at Corona Regional Medical Center ( Corona ) for the nursing staff.
352915_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals (UNAC/UHCP).
352915_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	Corona timely filed objections to the election and the results have not yet been certified.
352915_13_ITEM1_P69_S2	The National Labor Relations Board is currently investigating those objections.
352915_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
352915_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	The health care industry is highly competitive.
352915_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment.
352915_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes.
352915_13_ITEM1_P72_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_13_ITEM1_P72_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us.
352915_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.
352915_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in determining a hospital s success and competitive advantage.
352915_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient s needs, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital s facilities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P74_S3	We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.
352915_13_ITEM1_P74_S4	In addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals.
352915_13_ITEM1_P74_S5	We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_13_ITEM1_P74_S6	Our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate.
352915_13_ITEM1_P74_S7	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_13_ITEM1_P74_S8	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	Many states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws.
352915_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states.
352915_13_ITEM1_P75_S2	In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.
352915_13_ITEM1_P75_S3	Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges.
352915_13_ITEM1_P76_S2	In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients.
352915_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience.
352915_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	A key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	The competition to acquire hospitals is significant.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S3	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S4	We intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S5	Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust At December 31, 2012, we held approximately 6.2% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the Trust ).
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S6	We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S7	In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S8	Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S9	We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $2.1 million during 2012, $2.0 million during 2011 and $1.8 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S10	Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.2 million during 2012, $4.6 million during 2011 and $1.0 million during 2010, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S11	Included in our share of the Trust s income for 2011 was approximately $3.7 million related to our share of the following: (i) an aggregate gain realized by the Trust during 2011 in connection with the sale of medical office buildings by various limited liability companies ( LLCs ) in which the Trust formerly held noncontrolling, majority ownership interests; (ii) an aggregate gain recorded by the Trust during 2011 in connection with its purchases of third-party minority ownership interests in various LLCs in which the Trust formerly held noncontrolling majority ownership interests (the Trust now owns 100% of each of these entities), partially offset by; (iii) a provision for asset impairment recorded by the Trust during 2011 in connection with a medical office building located in Atlanta, Georgia.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S12	The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $9.3 million and $9.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S13	The market value of our investment in the Trust was $39.9 million at December 31, 2012 and $30.7 million at December 31, 2011, based on the closing price of the Trust s stock on the respective dates.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S14	Total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the Trust (as discussed below) was $16.3 million during each of 2012 and 2011 and $16.2 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM1_P79_S15	In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds either 100% of the ownership interest or various noncontrolling, majority ownership interests.
352915_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries.
352915_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms.
352915_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below.
352915_13_ITEM1_P80_S3	The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year.
352915_13_ITEM1_P80_S4	The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.
352915_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term.
352915_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.
352915_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	We also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at their appraised fair market value as well as purchase any or all of the four leased hospital properties at their appraised fair market value upon one month s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur.
352915_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	The table below details the renewal options and terms for each of our four hospital facilities leased from the Trust, giving effect to the above-mentioned renewals:
352915_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	(a) We have three 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).
352915_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	The executive officers, whose terms will expire at such time as their successors are elected, are as follows:
352915_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	Senior Vice President, President of Acute Care Division Mr. Alan B. Miller has been Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since inception and also served as President from inception until May, 2009.

352915_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also impact our business and results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	A significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in Nevada, Texas and California.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We own 6 acute care hospitals and 4 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Properties (we owned two additional behavioral health facilities which were acquired by us from PSI in November, 2010 before the facilities were divested during the third and fourth quarters of 2011 pursuant to our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, as discussed herein).
352915_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 16% in 2012, 17% in 2011 and 21% in 2010 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 8% in 2012, 11% in 2011 and 15% in 2010 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We own 7 acute care hospitals and 21 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 18% in 2012, 18% in 2011 and 20% in 2010 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 12% in 2012, 14% in 2011 and 15% in 2010 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	California: We own 4 acute care hospitals and 6 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 10% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2012, 2011 and 2010.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 6% in 2012, 5% in 2011 and 4% in 2010 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	The significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative, regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in Nevada, Texas and California.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We derive a significant portion of our revenue from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If the rates paid or the scope of services covered by government payors are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Virginia, Illinois and Massachusetts, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective 2013 state fiscal years) as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In the states in which we operate, based upon the state budgets for the 2012 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2011), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates have been reduced by approximately 3% to 4% (or approximately $45 million to $55 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states 2011 fiscal years (which generally ended during the third quarter of 2011).
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Our consolidated results of operations during 2012 and 2011 include the pro rata portion of these Medicaid rate reductions.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Based upon the state budgets for the 2013 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2012), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates will be reduced by approximately 1% (or approximately $15 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states 2012 fiscal years (which generally ended during the third quarter of 2012).
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S6	In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors, including managed care providers, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Private payors, including managed care providers, increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S8	We expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S9	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S10	A worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S11	Our patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance, which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S12	A continuation or worsening of economic conditions may result in a continued high unemployment rate which will likely increase the number of individuals without health insurance.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S13	As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or a significant increase in services provided to uninsured patients.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P7_S14	These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our patient revenues and payor mix during the last few years were adversely affected by economic conditions, particularly in certain markets, such as Nevada, Texas and California, where a significant portion of our revenues are concentrated and unemployment rates remain high.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In our acute care business, we experienced net revenue pressures caused primarily by declining commercial payor utilization and an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients treated at our facilities.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We can provide no assurance that these trends will not continue.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	During 2012, our revenues and payor mix within our acute care operations have been volatile making it difficult to predict the results for 2013 or thereafter.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In addition, we recorded approximately $2.37 billion of aggregate goodwill as a result of our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010 and Ascend in October, 2012, and, as of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $3.04 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	things, a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates, a continued rise in the unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Reductions or changes in Medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	On January 3, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the 2012 Act ).
352915_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The 2012 Act postponed for two months sequestration cuts mandated under the Budget Control Act of 2011.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The postponed sequestration cuts include a 2% annual reduction over ten years in Medicare spending to providers.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The 2012 Act provides a one-year fix to statutory reductions in physician reimbursement and extends other Medicare provisions.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In order to offset the cost of these extensions, the 2012 Act reduces payments to other providers totaling almost $26 billion over ten years.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Approximately half of those funds will come from reductions in Medicare reimbursement to hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Sources of Revenue-Medicare , for additional disclosure.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The 2012 Act includes a document and coding ( DCI ) adjustment and a reduction in Medicaid DSH payments.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Expected to save $10.5 billion over 10 years, the DCI adjustment decreases projected Medicare hospital payments for inpatient and overnight care through a downward adjustment in annual base payment increases.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	These reductions are meant to recoup what Medicare authorities consider to be overpayments to hospitals that occurred as a result of the transition to Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The reduction in Medicaid DSH payments is expected to save $4.2 billion over 10 years.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	This provision extends the changes regarding DSH payments established by the Legislation and determines future allotments off of the rebased level.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA ).
352915_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Reconciliation Act ), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the Legislation ), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Although it is expected that as a result of the Legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients, which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable, the Legislation makes a number of other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Legislation revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The Legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning October 1, 2011 for Medicare Part B reimbursable items and services and beginning October 1, 2012 for Medicare inpatient hospital services.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Legislation will reduce Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments ( DSH ) beginning in 2014, which would adversely impact the reimbursement we receive under these programs.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The Legislation implements a value-based purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or hospital-acquired condition rates.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government s ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the Legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing Medicaid funding.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Therefore, states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of federal Medicaid funding.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	As a result, it remains unclear whether states will adopt Legislation Medicaid expansion provisions without the threat of loss of federal funding.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The various provisions in the Legislation that directly or indirectly affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The impact of the Legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations, interpretive guidance and possible future legislation.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Certain Legislation provisions, such as those creating the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, create uncertainty in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Thus, we cannot predict the impact of the Legislation on our future reimbursement at this time and we can provide no assurance that the Legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Legislation also contains provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The Legislation amends several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	While Congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found in violation of such law, the Legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act, although final regulations implementing this statutory requirement remain pending.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The Legislation also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The impact of the Legislation on each of our hospitals may vary.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Because Legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years, we anticipate that many of the provisions in the Legislation may be subject to further revision.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We cannot predict the impact the Legislation may have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity, or whether we will be able to successfully adapt to the changes required by the Legislation.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In accordance with our internal policies and procedures, as well as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical treatment (whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition, we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient s medical condition, within the facility s capability, or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital s written procedures.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively, but has yet to issue further guidance in response to that request.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly, or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under EMTALA is proposed and adopted, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price, patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In recent years, the number of quality measures that hospitals are required to report publicly has increased.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	CMS publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the Medicare program.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Additionally, the Legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish, update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If any of our hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys (or results that are lower than our competitors) or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volume could decline because patients may elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	This circumstance could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S4	An increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Collection of receivables from third-party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and deductibles.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S7	However, we also have substantial receivables due to us as of December 31, 2012 (a significant portion of which is past due) from certain state-based funding programs, most particularly Illinois.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S8	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables, historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S9	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S10	Significant changes in business office operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S11	If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S12	Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P28_S13	The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals, and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a result, most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	As a result, the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals, and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	They may terminate their affiliation with us at any time.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	If we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P32_S5	It may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals are located.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Generally, the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P32_S8	The loss of one or more of these physicians, even if temporary, could cause a material reduction in our revenues, which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	If we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment, our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The technology used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and, as a result, manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	To compete effectively, we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry, patients may seek treatment from other providers and/or physicians may refer their patients to alternate sources, which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If we fail to effectively and timely implement electronic health record systems, our operations could be harmed.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	As required by HITECH, we are in the process of developing and implementing an incentive payment program for eligible hospitals and health care professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P34_S5	If our facilities or physicians are unable to meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing an electronic health record system.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Further, beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, eligible hospitals and professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology will be subject to reduced payments from Medicare.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Any failure by us to effectively implement an electronic health record system in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P35_S4	The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets, which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P36_S4	If our general labor and related expenses increase, we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P36_S6	Increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P36_S7	Union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future, to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionized, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P36_S8	If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things: hospital billing practices and prices for services; relationships with physicians and other referral sources; adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services; ownership of facilities; qualifications of medical and support personnel; confidentiality, maintenance, privacy and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our facilities; operating policies and procedures, and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Among these laws are the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the federal anti-kickback statute and the provision of the Social Security Act commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	These laws, and particularly the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P37_S4	We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	A number of our current arrangements, including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	CMS recently published a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol, which is intended to allow providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark law.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the Stark law, there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the Stark law or that self-disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Federal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that require us to implement and, in the future, may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient s health and related financial information.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Additionally, recent changes to HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements, including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	These laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In the future, it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws (see Item 3-Legal Proceedings ), or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P41_S5	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P41_S6	See Item 1 Business Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation .
352915_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We are subject to occupational health, safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Regulatory requirements affecting us include, but are not limited to, those covering: (i) air and water quality control; (ii) occupational health and safety (e.g., standards regarding blood-borne pathogens and ergonomics, etc.); (iii) waste management; (iv) the handling of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances; and (v) other hazardous materials.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P42_S5	If we fail to comply with those standards, we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P42_S6	We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P42_S7	We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P42_S8	Some of these actions may involve large claims, as well as significant defense costs.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P42_S9	We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	All professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We believe that, based on our past experience and actuarial estimates, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	While we continuously monitor our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We may be subject to governmental investigations, regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits The federal False Claims Act permits private parties to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits against companies.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Legal Proceedings for disclosure of current related matters.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The failure of certain employers, or the closure of certain facilities, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The economies in the non-urban communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependant on a small number of large employers.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	The failure of one or more large employer or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our hospitals operate, could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	The occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations, thereby harming our business.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P48_S4	If any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	All of our hospitals are deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S5	However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Our level of indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisitions of PSI and Ascend could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Our level of indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisitions of PSI and Ascend could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could potentially prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S8	As of December 31, 2012, our total debt was $3.73 billion and we had $600 million of unused borrowing capacity under our credit agreement and accounts receivable securitization facilities, after taking into account outstanding letters of credit.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S9	Subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility, the indenture that governs the notes and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S10	If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P49_S11	Our leverage could result in unfavorable impact on us, including the following:
352915_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our growth strategy depends, in part, on acquisitions, and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	We may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not-for-profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P50_S4	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit healthcare companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Also, suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	In addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that affect the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a healthcare facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation, increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals, increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria, any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital s results of operations, allocation of the purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S6	We may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire, which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S7	We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S8	We may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S9	Integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S10	In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by acquired hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S11	In addition, some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S12	If we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire, operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals, our results of operations could be harmed.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S13	If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P51_S14	Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility s reputation could harm our business.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions (see Item 3-Legal Proceedings ).
352915_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted Certificates of Need, or CON, laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization review, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Fluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	If we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future, the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In addition to our operating results, many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, managed care contract negotiations and terminations, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S2	As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S3	While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S4	For example, we cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S5	We also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S6	If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S7	If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S8	A cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of member privacy, or other negative impacts.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S9	A cyber-attack that bypasses our information technology ( IT ) security systems causing an IT security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws, loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption of our IT business systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S10	In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of public health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S11	Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S12	Generally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S13	Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P57_S14	Differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P60_S2	We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P60_S3	We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	To fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P62_S3	We depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P62_S4	The expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P62_S5	The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities, which could harm our business.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	At December 31, 2012, 28.1 million shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P63_S3	To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P63_S4	In addition, from time-to-time our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P63_S6	Conversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P63_S7	Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The right to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P64_S2	As of March 21, 2012, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 7.5% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect five members of the Board of Directors and constituted 87.3% of our general voting power.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P64_S3	As of March 21, 2012, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options) constituted 92.5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 12.7% of our general voting power.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P64_S4	As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P64_S5	Each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).
352915_13_ITEM1A_P64_S6	In the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock, which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P64_S7	The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P64_S8	Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his family who are also directors and officers of our company, and they can elect a majority of our company s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.
352915_13_ITEM1A_P64_S9	In addition, because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.
352915_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as of December 31, 2012, are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	We incurred no additional capital lease obligations during 2012.
352915_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Professional and General Liability, Workers Compensation Liability and Property Insurance Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability: Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence.
352915_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	Prior to our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010, our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	Prior to our acquisition in November, 2010, the PSI subsidiaries were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a $3 million self-insured retention to a limit of $75 million.
352915_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	acquisition of PSI to manage the self-insured retention for all former PSI subsidiaries for claims incurred prior to January 1, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	The captive insurance company also continues to insure all professional and general liability claims, regardless of date incurred, for the former PSI subsidiaries located in Florida and Puerto Rico.
352915_13_ITEM2_P2_S2	Since our acquisition of PSI on November 15, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries (which are not former PSI subsidiaries) are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence.
352915_13_ITEM2_P2_S3	Effective November, 2010, our subsidiaries (including the former PSI subsidiaries) were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_13_ITEM2_P2_S4	We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	The 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012 have general and professional liability policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to $20 million of aggregate coverage, subject to a $10,000 per occurrence deductible.
352915_13_ITEM2_P3_S1	These facilities, like our other facilities, are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_13_ITEM2_P4_S0	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_13_ITEM2_P4_S1	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_13_ITEM2_P4_S2	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM2_P4_S3	As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims, including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from PSI, was $279 million, of which $48 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_13_ITEM2_P4_S4	As of December 31, 2011, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims, including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from PSI, was $292 million, of which $60 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_13_ITEM2_P4_S5	We recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $27 million during 2012, $11 million during 2011 and $49 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM2_P4_S6	The favorable change recorded during 2012 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis.
352915_13_ITEM2_P4_S7	The favorable change recorded during 2011 consisted primarily of third-party recoveries and reserve reductions in connection with PHICO related claims which we became liable for upon PHICO s (a former commercial insurance carrier) liquidation in 2002.
352915_13_ITEM2_P4_S8	The favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2010 were due to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 75% from 50%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 25% from 50%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years.
352915_13_ITEM2_P4_S9	As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends.
352915_13_ITEM2_P5_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $66 million, of which $35 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_13_ITEM2_P5_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $65 million, of which $34 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_13_ITEM2_P5_S2	There were no material adjustments to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims recorded during 2012 or 2011.
352915_13_ITEM2_P5_S3	Based upon the results of workers compensation reserves analyses, during 2010, we recorded a reduction to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims amounting to $4 million.
352915_13_ITEM2_P5_S4	We have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a $250,000 deductible for the majority of our properties (the properties acquired from Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. are subject to a $50,000 deductible).
352915_13_ITEM2_P5_S5	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_13_ITEM2_P5_S6	In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_13_ITEM2_P5_S7	Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented fault zones.
352915_13_ITEM2_P5_S8	Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_13_ITEM2_P5_S9	The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million.
352915_13_ITEM2_P5_S10	Flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.
352915_13_ITEM2_P6_S0	The 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012 have commercial property insurance policies which provide for full replacement cost coverage, subject to a $10,000 deductible.
352915_13_ITEM2_P7_S0	Legal Proceedings We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to litigation, as outlined below.
352915_13_ITEM2_P8_S0	In April, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) issued notice of its decision terminating Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital ( Two Rivers ) in Kansas City, Missouri from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid program.
352915_13_ITEM2_P8_S1	The termination notice was issued as a result of surveys conducted which allegedly found Two Rivers to be out of compliance with the conditions of participation required for participation in the Medicare program and for Two Rivers alleged failure to alleviate an immediate jeopardy situation.
352915_13_ITEM2_P9_S0	Two Rivers filed an administrative appeal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeal Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review and reversal of that decision.
352915_13_ITEM2_P9_S1	In addition, Two Rivers filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against CMS rescinding the termination action.
352915_13_ITEM2_P9_S2	Later in April, 2011, the District Court issued a temporary restraining order abating the termination action pending a preliminary injunction hearing or an agreement with CMS.
352915_13_ITEM2_P9_S3	In May, 2011, Two Rivers and CMS entered into a settlement agreement which resulted in the rescission of the termination notice and actions by CMS.
352915_13_ITEM2_P9_S4	Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Two Rivers was required to submit an acceptable plan of correction relative to the immediate jeopardy citation and engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for Two Rivers to meet the applicable Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_13_ITEM2_P9_S5	Both of these actions have occurred.
352915_13_ITEM2_P10_S0	Pursuant to the agreement, CMS conducted an initial survey of Two Rivers in April 2012 to determine if the Medicare conditions of participation, which formed the basis of the termination action in April 2011, had been met.
352915_13_ITEM2_P10_S1	In late April, 2012, CMS advised Two Rivers that it has successfully passed this initial survey.
352915_13_ITEM2_P10_S2	Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, a second survey will be conducted in early 2013 to further confirm that Two Rivers is in compliance with all Medicare/Medicaid Conditions of Participation.
352915_13_ITEM2_P11_S0	Two Rivers remains fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the community it serves.
352915_13_ITEM2_P11_S1	We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with CMS in an effort to resolve these matters.
352915_13_ITEM2_P11_S2	We can provide no assurance that Two Rivers will not ultimately lose its Medicare certification.
352915_13_ITEM2_P11_S3	The operating results of Two Rivers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2012 or 2011.
352915_13_ITEM2_P12_S0	In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICDs ) from 2003 to the present at several of our acute care facilities.
352915_13_ITEM2_P12_S1	The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Claims Determination regarding these devices.
352915_13_ITEM2_P12_S2	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM2_P13_S0	In July, 2012, one of our subsidiaries, Peachford Behavioral Health System of Atlanta located in Atlanta, Georgia, received a subpoena from the OIG for the Department of Health and Human Services requesting various documents from 2004 to the present.
352915_13_ITEM2_P13_S1	We are in the process of securing and collecting the requested documents for production.
352915_13_ITEM2_P13_S2	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_13_ITEM2_P14_S0	In February, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena requesting various documents from January 2008 to the present directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and several UHS owned facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a, The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_13_ITEM2_P14_S1	The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the present.
352915_13_ITEM2_P14_S2	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigations, liability of the facilities and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with these matters.
352915_13_ITEM2_P14_S3	Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013.
352915_13_ITEM2_P15_S0	The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010: Garden City Employees Retirement System v. PSI: This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws.
352915_13_ITEM2_P15_S1	We intend to defend the case vigorously.
352915_13_ITEM2_P15_S2	Should we be deemed liable in this matter, we believe we would be entitled to commercial insurance recoveries for amounts paid by us, subject to certain limitations and deductibles.
352915_13_ITEM2_P16_S0	Although we believe the commercial insurance recoveries are adequate to satisfy potential liability and related legal fees in connection with this matter, we can provide no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the commercial insurance recoveries which would make us liable for the excess.
352915_13_ITEM2_P17_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_13_ITEM2_P18_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_13_ITEM2_P18_S1	The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_13_ITEM2_P18_S2	Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July 2011 requesting additional documents, which have been collected and delivered to the DOJ.
352915_13_ITEM2_P19_S0	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_13_ITEM2_P20_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_13_ITEM2_P20_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_13_ITEM2_P20_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ.
352915_13_ITEM2_P20_S3	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_13_ITEM2_P21_S0	Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims: The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services ( DMAS ) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state s Medicaid Provider Services Manual ( Manual ).
352915_13_ITEM2_P21_S1	As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities.
352915_13_ITEM2_P21_S2	PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending.
352915_13_ITEM2_P21_S3	We have recently reached a preliminary settlement of this matter which requires finalization of a definitive agreement and approval of Virginia state officials.
352915_13_ITEM2_P21_S4	The aggregate refund of Medicaid payments made to those facilities, as requested by DMAS, and the settlement amount is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM2_P22_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse.
352915_13_ITEM2_P22_S1	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
352915_13_ITEM2_P22_S2	Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_13_ITEM2_P22_S3	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_13_ITEM2_P23_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_13_ITEM2_P23_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_13_ITEM2_P23_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein.
352915_13_ITEM2_P23_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_13_ITEM2_P24_S0	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_13_ITEM2_P24_S1	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_13_ITEM2_P24_S2	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_13_ITEM2_P24_S3	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.
352915_13_ITEM2_P24_S4	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_13_ITEM2_P24_S5	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM2_P25_S0	7- Lease Commitments , we have various other contractual commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2012 as follows: (i) other combined estimated future purchase obligations of $290 million related to a long-term contract with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing services for our acute care facilities ($106 million), expected future costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the purchase, implementation and on-going operation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities ($181 million) and estimated minimum liabilities for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future ($3 million), and; (ii) combined estimated future payments of $225 million related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan ($208 million consisting of estimated payments through 2087) and other retirement plan liabilities ($17 million).

352915_13_ITEM2_P27_S0	The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries.
352915_13_ITEM2_P27_S1	Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms.
352915_13_ITEM2_P27_S2	Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below.
352915_13_ITEM2_P27_S3	The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year.
352915_13_ITEM2_P27_S4	The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.

352915_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	In April, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) issued notice of its decision terminating Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital ( Two Rivers ) in Kansas City, Missouri from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid program.
352915_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	The termination notice was issued as a result of surveys conducted which allegedly found Two Rivers to be out of compliance with the conditions of participation required for participation in the Medicare program and for Two Rivers alleged failure to alleviate an immediate jeopardy situation.
352915_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	Appeal Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review and reversal of that decision.
352915_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	In addition, Two Rivers filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against CMS rescinding the termination action.
352915_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	Later in April, 2011, the District Court issued a temporary restraining order abating the termination action pending a preliminary injunction hearing or an agreement with CMS.
352915_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	In May, 2011, Two Rivers and CMS entered into a settlement agreement which resulted in the rescission of the termination notice and actions by CMS.
352915_13_ITEM3_P1_S4	Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Two Rivers was required to submit an acceptable plan of correction relative to the immediate jeopardy citation and engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for Two Rivers to meet the applicable Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_13_ITEM3_P1_S5	Both of these actions have occurred.
352915_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	Pursuant to the agreement, CMS conducted an initial survey of Two Rivers in April 2012 to determine if the Medicare conditions of participation, which formed the basis of the termination action in April 2011, had been met.
352915_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	In late April, 2012, CMS advised Two Rivers that it has successfully passed this initial survey.
352915_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, a second survey will be conducted in early 2013 to further confirm that Two Rivers is in compliance with all Medicare/Medicaid Conditions of Participation.
352915_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	During the term of this agreement, Two Rivers remains eligible to receive reimbursements for services rendered to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
352915_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	Two Rivers remains fully committed to providing high-quality healthcare to their patients and the community it serves.
352915_13_ITEM3_P3_S1	We therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with CMS in an effort to resolve these matters.
352915_13_ITEM3_P3_S2	We can provide no assurance that Two Rivers will not ultimately lose its Medicare certification.
352915_13_ITEM3_P3_S3	The operating results of Two Rivers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2012 or 2011.
352915_13_ITEM3_P4_S0	In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICDs ) from 2003 to the present at several of our acute care facilities.
352915_13_ITEM3_P4_S1	The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Claims Determination regarding these devices.
352915_13_ITEM3_P4_S2	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM3_P5_S0	In July, 2012, one of our subsidiaries, Peachford Behavioral Health System of Atlanta located in Atlanta, Georgia, received a subpoena from the OIG for the Department of Health and Human Services requesting various documents from 2004 to the present.
352915_13_ITEM3_P5_S1	We are in the process of securing and collecting the requested documents for production.
352915_13_ITEM3_P5_S2	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_13_ITEM3_P6_S0	In February, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena requesting various documents from January 2008 to the present directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and several UHS owned facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a, The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_13_ITEM3_P6_S1	The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the present.
352915_13_ITEM3_P6_S2	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigations, liability of the facilities and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with these matters.
352915_13_ITEM3_P6_S3	Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013.
352915_13_ITEM3_P7_S0	The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010: Garden City Employees Retirement System v. PSI: This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws.
352915_13_ITEM3_P7_S1	We intend to defend the case vigorously.
352915_13_ITEM3_P7_S2	Should we be deemed liable in this matter, we believe we would be entitled to commercial insurance recoveries for amounts paid by us, subject to certain limitations and deductibles.
352915_13_ITEM3_P7_S3	Included in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, is an estimated reserve (current liability) and corresponding commercial insurance recovery (current asset) which did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM3_P7_S4	Although we believe the commercial insurance recoveries are adequate to satisfy potential liability and related legal fees in connection with this matter, we can provide no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the commercial insurance recoveries which would make us liable for the excess.
352915_13_ITEM3_P8_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_13_ITEM3_P9_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_13_ITEM3_P9_S1	The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_13_ITEM3_P9_S2	Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July 2011 requesting additional documents, which have been collected and delivered to the DOJ.
352915_13_ITEM3_P10_S0	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_13_ITEM3_P11_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_13_ITEM3_P11_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_13_ITEM3_P11_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ.
352915_13_ITEM3_P11_S3	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_13_ITEM3_P12_S0	Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims: The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services ( DMAS ) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state s Medicaid Provider Services Manual ( Manual ).
352915_13_ITEM3_P12_S1	As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities.
352915_13_ITEM3_P12_S2	PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending.
352915_13_ITEM3_P12_S3	We have recently reached a preliminary settlement of this matter which requires finalization of a definitive agreement and approval of Virginia state officials.
352915_13_ITEM3_P12_S4	The aggregate refund of Medicaid payments made to those facilities, as requested by DMAS, and the settlement amount is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM3_P13_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse.
352915_13_ITEM3_P14_S0	abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
352915_13_ITEM3_P14_S1	Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_13_ITEM3_P14_S2	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_13_ITEM3_P15_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_13_ITEM3_P15_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_13_ITEM3_P15_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein.
352915_13_ITEM3_P15_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_13_ITEM3_P15_S4	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_13_ITEM3_P15_S5	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_13_ITEM3_P15_S6	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_13_ITEM3_P15_S7	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.
352915_13_ITEM3_P15_S8	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_13_ITEM3_P15_S9	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

352915_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers.
352915_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	As of February 28, 2013, we owned and/or operated 23 acute care hospitals and 197 behavioral health centers located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 5 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 4 states.
352915_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	In October, 2012, we acquired Ascend Health Corporation ( Ascend ).
352915_13_ITEM7_P0_S4	Ascend was the largest private behavioral health provider with 9 owned or leased freestanding inpatient facilities located in 5 states.
352915_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	No. 2011-07, Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities, which required certain health care entities to change the presentation in their statement of operations by reclassifying the provision for bad debts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts).
352915_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	As a result, the provision for doubtful accounts for our acute care and behavioral health care facilities is reflected as a deduction from net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for 2012, 2011 and 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	The adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial position or overall results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues in 2012, 51% in 2011 and 67% in 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues during 2012, 49% during 2011 and 33% during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.
352915_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, and statements of our goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.
352915_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Words such as may, will, should, could, would, predicts, potential, continue, expects, anticipates, future, intends, plans, believes, estimates, appears, projects and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved.
352915_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Such factors include, among other things, the following:
352915_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level.
352915_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us, including matters as disclosed in Item 3.
352915_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	as discussed below in Sources of Revenue , we receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate, (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Virginia, Illinois and Massachusetts); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Indiana and Ohio, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina.
352915_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective states 2012 and 2013 fiscal years) as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria .
352915_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	Certain of our acute care hospitals implemented EHR applications in 2011 and 2012 and we plan to continue the implementation at each of our acute care hospitals, on a facility-by-facility basis, until completion which is expected to occur in mid-2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P9_S5	However, there can be no assurance that we (our acute care hospitals) will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and, should we qualify, we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amounts are dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each hospital.
352915_13_ITEM7_P9_S6	Should we qualify for incentive payments, there may be timing differences in the recognition of the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the EHR application which may cause material period-to-period changes in our future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the Joint Committee ), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented which, if triggered, would result in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (approximately $39 million annual reduction to our Medicare net revenues) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs starting in 2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, our accounts receivable includes approximately $70 million and $54 million, respectively, due from Illinois.
352915_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	Collection of these receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures.
352915_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Approximately $51 million as of December 31, 2012, and $41 million as of December 31, 2011, of the receivables due from Illinois have been outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date, and a large portion will likely remain outstanding for the foreseeable future.
352915_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois.
352915_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

352915_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
352915_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in Note 1 to the financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following: Revenue recognition: We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 39% of our net patient revenues during 2012, 41% during 2011 and 42% during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 49% of our net patient revenues during 2012, 47% during 2011 and 51% during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_13_ITEM7_P16_S7	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_13_ITEM7_P16_S8	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P16_S9	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_13_ITEM7_P16_S10	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2012, 2011 or 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of December 31, 2012, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.
352915_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care and Uninsured Discounts in Acute Care Hospital Services for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending our patient accounting system records net revenues for the services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patient s Medicaid eligibility.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S5	Based on general factors as discussed below in Provision for Doubtful Accounts , our acute care facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S6	Such estimated uncollectible amounts related to Medicaid pending, as well as other accounts receivable payer classifications, are considered when the overall individual facility and company-wide reserves are developed.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S7	Adjustments related to the final determination of these accounts did not materially impact our results of operations in 2012, 2011 or 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S8	Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S9	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S10	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S11	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S12	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S13	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S14	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_13_ITEM7_P21_S15	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of a minimum of 30% of total charges.
352915_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.
352915_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	As of December 31, 2012, our accounts receivable includes $70 million due from Illinois ($54 million as of December 31, 2011), the collection of which has been delayed due to budgetary and funding pressures experienced by the state.
352915_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	Although as of December 31, 2012 approximately $51 million of the receivables due from Illinois have been outstanding in excess of 60 days ($41 million as of December 31, 2011), and a large portion will likely remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us and therefore no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois.
352915_13_ITEM7_P24_S5	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
352915_13_ITEM7_P24_S6	On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience.
352915_13_ITEM7_P24_S7	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $311 million and $253 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM7_P24_S8	Approximately 87% during 2012 and 93% during each of 2011 and 2010, of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our acute care hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM7_P24_S9	Shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of December 31, 2012 and 2011: As of December 31, 2012:
352915_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	As of December 31, 2011: Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
352915_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	The regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
352915_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Medicare EHR incentive payments: Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Medicaid EHR incentive payments: Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals meet the meaningful use criteria.
352915_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurs in the period in which the applicable hospitals are deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria.
352915_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	Upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods.
352915_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria are included in other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Self-Insured Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P29_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_13_ITEM7_P29_S5	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability: Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence.
352915_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Prior to our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010, our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	Prior to our acquisition in November, 2010, the PSI subsidiaries were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a $3 million self-insured retention to a limit of $75 million.
352915_13_ITEM7_P30_S4	PSI utilized its captive insurance company and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of PSI to manage the self-insured retention for all former PSI subsidiaries for claims incurred prior to January 1, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P30_S5	The captive insurance company also continues to insure all professional and general liability claims, regardless of date incurred, for the former PSI subsidiaries located in Florida and Puerto Rico.
352915_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Effective November, 2010, our subsidiaries (including the former PSI subsidiaries) were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	The 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012 have general and professional liability policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to $20 million of aggregate coverage, subject to a $10,000 per occurrence deductible.
352915_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	These facilities, like our other facilities, are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims, including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from PSI, was $279 million, of which $48 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S4	As of December 31, 2011, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims, including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from PSI, was $292 million, of which $60 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S5	We recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $27 million during 2012, $11 million during 2011 and $49 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S6	The favorable change recorded during 2012 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S7	The favorable change recorded during 2011 consisted primarily of third-party recoveries and reserve reductions in connection with PHICO related claims which we became liable for upon PHICO s (a former commercial insurance carrier) liquidation in 2002.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S8	The favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2010 were due to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 75% from 50%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 25% from 50%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S9	As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S10	There were no material adjustments to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims recorded during 2012 or 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S11	Based upon the results of workers compensation reserves analyses, during 2010, we recorded a reduction to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims amounting to $4 million.
352915_13_ITEM7_P33_S12	Although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for self-insured general and professional and workers compensation claims, given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves as discussed above, it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves.
352915_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and workers compensation reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2012 (amount in thousands):
352915_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	(a) General and professional liability amounts are net of adjustments recorded during each year, as discussed above.
352915_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	(b) Workers compensation amount for 2010 is net of adjustment recorded during the year, as discussed above.
352915_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	In addition, we also maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	The ultimate costs related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	We have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a $250,000 deductible for the majority of our properties (the properties acquired from Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. are subject to a $50,000 deductible).
352915_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented fault zones.
352915_13_ITEM7_P37_S4	Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_13_ITEM7_P37_S5	The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million.
352915_13_ITEM7_P37_S6	Flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.
352915_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	The 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012 have commercial property insurance policies which provide for full replacement cost coverage, subject to a $10,000 deductible.
352915_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years, the cost of commercial property insurance has increased.
352915_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	As a result, catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	Given these insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends, or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Goodwill: Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	We have designated September 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2012 which indicated no impairment of goodwill.
352915_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill.
352915_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.

352915_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	a decrease of $27 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from the income tax provision on the $72 million increase in pre-tax income ($67 million increase in income before income taxes plus the $5 million increase in income resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests).
352915_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010:
352915_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	Net revenues increased 38% or $1.86 billion to $6.76 billion during 2011 as compared to $4.90 billion during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	The increase was primarily attributable to:
352915_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	$1.64 billion increase in revenues at the facilities acquired by us from PSI (includes the period of January through November of 2011 as compared to November 15th through November 30 th of 2010).

352915_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	a decrease of $95 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from: (i) a net increase in pre-tax income of $263 million ($268 million increase in income before income taxes net of the $5 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests), and; (ii) a $4 million favorable discrete tax item recorded during the third quarter of 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Acute Care Hospital Services Year Ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011:
352915_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands): On a same facility basis during 2012, as compared to 2011, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $14 million or less than 1%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	Income before income taxes decreased $52 million or 15% to $291 million or 8.5% of net revenues during 2012 as compared to $343 million or 10.0% of net revenues during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P56_S3	Inpatient admissions to these facilities decreased 2.0% during 2012, as compared to 2011, while patient days decreased 1.7%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P56_S4	Adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 0.2% and adjusted patient days increased 0.5% during 2012, as compared to 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P56_S5	The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.5 days during each of 2012 and 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	facilities, was 56% during 2012 and 58% during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 0.2% during 2012, as compared to 2011, and net revenue per adjusted patient day decreased 0.1% during 2012, as compared to 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	The decrease in income before income taxes and pressure on patient volumes, net revenues and net revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day experienced at our acute care hospitals during 2012, as compared to 2011, were largely due a decline in organic revenue growth caused by the continuing trends of weak demand and deteriorating payor mix.
352915_13_ITEM7_P57_S3	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2012 and 2011, which includes our acute care results on a same facility basis, as well as the impact of other items as mentioned below (dollar amounts in thousands).
352915_13_ITEM7_P57_S4	During 2012, as compared to 2011, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased 1% or $37 million to $3.46 billion due primarily to the above-mentioned agreement related to underpayments of Medicare inpatient prospective payments during a number of prior years and an increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above.
352915_13_ITEM7_P57_S5	Income before income taxes decreased $16 million to $337 million or 9.7% of net revenues during 2012 as compared to $353 million or 10.3% of net revenues during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P57_S6	Included in these results are the following:
352915_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	an increase of $2 million related to the incentive income ($30 million), net of expenses ($28 million), recorded during 2012 in connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010:
352915_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands): On a same facility basis during 2011, as compared to 2010, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $151 million or 5%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	Income before income taxes increased $26 million or 8% to $343 million or 10.0% of net revenues during 2011 as compared to $317 million or 9.7% of net revenues during 2010.

352915_13_ITEM7_P59_S4	Adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) decreased 0.1% and adjusted patient days increased 1.8% during 2011, as compared to 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P59_S5	The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.5 days during 2011 and 4.4 days during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P59_S6	The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 58% during 2011 and 59% during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P59_S7	On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 4.7% during 2011, as compared to 2010, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.7% during 2011, as compared to 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	The increase in income before income taxes at our acute care hospitals during 2011, as compared to 2010, was due primarily to favorable operating trends experienced during the first six months of 2011 (a favorable change in payor mix and acuity of patients treated at our hospitals, a stabilization of our uninsured patient volumes and a reduction in our supplies expense).
352915_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	These favorable operating trends moderated during the second half of 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2011 and 2010 which includes our acute care results on a same facility basis, as well as the impact of other items as mentioned below (dollar amounts in thousands): During 2011, as compared to 2010, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased 5% or $151 million to $3.42 billion due to an increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above.
352915_13_ITEM7_P60_S3	Income before income taxes increased $1 million to $353 million or 10.3% of net revenues during 2011 as compared to $352 million or 10.8% of net revenues during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P60_S4	The increase in income before income taxes at our acute care facilities resulted from:
352915_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	an increase of $7 million resulting from the write-off of certain costs during 2010 related to an acute care hospital construction project.
352915_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Charity Care and Uninsured Discounts: A significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in uninsured discounts amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:
352915_13_ITEM7_P64_S3	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_13_ITEM7_P64_S4	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities (excluding provision for doubtful accounts) divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P64_S5	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for our behavioral health care facilities, on a same facility basis, and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands): On a same facility basis during 2012, as compared to 2011, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities increased 4% or $138 million to $3.38 billion during 2012 as compared to $3.24 billion during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	Income before income taxes increased $76 million or 10% to $810 million or 24.0% of net revenues during 2012 as compared to $734 million or 22.7% of net revenues during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	Inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 4.9% during 2012, as compared to 2011, while patient days increased 1.0%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	Adjusted admissions increased 5.0% and adjusted patient days increased 1.0% during 2012, as compared to 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P65_S4	The average length of patient stay at these facilities was 14.0 days during 2012 and 14.6 days during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P65_S5	The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 74% during each of 2012 and 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P65_S6	On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities decreased 0.7% during 2012, as compared to 2011, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.2% during 2012, as compared to 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our behavioral health care facilities for 2012 and 2011, including the 9 facilities acquired in October, 2012 from Ascend Health Corporation, as well as the impact of various other items as mentioned below (dollar amounts in thousands): During 2012, as compared to 2011, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities increased 5% or $151 million to $3.46 billion during 2012 as compared to $3.31 billion during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	The increase in net revenues was attributable to:
352915_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	$42 million of other combined decreases resulting primarily from the divestiture of San Juan Capestrano in January, 2012 (pursuant to our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with our acquisition of PSI).
352915_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	Income before income taxes increased $109 million or 15% to $839 million or 24.2% of net revenues during 2012, as compared to $729 million or 22.0% of net revenues during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	The increase in income before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to:
352915_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	a $17 million of other combined net increases, including the income generated at the 9 facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for our behavioral health care facilities, on a same facility basis, and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	On November 15, 2010, we acquired PSI which was formerly the largest operator of freestanding inpatient behavioral health care facilities operating inpatient and outpatient facilities in 32 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Since the former PSI facilities were acquired by us in mid-November, 2010, for accurate comparability purposes, we have included the patient statistics and financial results for these facilities in our same facility results provided below beginning on December 1st of 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands): On a same facility basis during 2011, as compared to 2010, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities increased 6% or $94 million to $1.60 billion during 2011 as compared to $1.51 billion during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	Income before income taxes increased $29 million or 9% to $366 million or 22.8% of net revenues during 2011 as compared to $337 million or 22.3% of net revenues during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P70_S3	Inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 7.7% during 2011, as compared to 2010, while patient days increased 3.4%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P70_S4	Adjusted admissions increased 7.6% and adjusted patient days increased 3.3% during 2011, as compared to 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P70_S5	The average length of patient stay at these facilities was 14.2 days during 2011 and 14.8 days during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P70_S6	The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 74% during each of 2011 and 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P70_S7	On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities decreased 1.1% during 2011, as compared to 2010, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.9% during 2011, as compared to 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P70_S8	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our behavioral health care facilities for 2011 and 2010 including newly acquired or recently opened facilities and the favorable effect resulting from reductions to our professional and general liability and workers compensation self-insurance reserves as discussed in Self-Insured Risks .
352915_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	the eleven-month period ended November 30, 2011 and the period of November 15, 2010 (date of acquisition) through December 31, 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	During 2011, as compared to 2010, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities increased 107% or $1.71 billion to $3.31 billion during 2011 as compared to $1.60 billion during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	The increase in net revenues was attributable to:
352915_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	a $1.62 billion increase resulting primarily from the revenues generated at the facilities acquired by us from PSI (represents the increase in revenues for the period of January through November, 2011 as compared to November 15, 2010 to November 30, 2010).
352915_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	Income before income taxes increased $376 million or 107% to $729 million or 22.0% of net revenues during 2011, as compared to $353 million or 22.1% of net revenues during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	The increase in income before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to:
352915_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	a $347 million of other combined net increases, consisting primarily of the income generated at the PSI facilities acquired by us in November, 2010 (represents the increase in income before income taxes generated at these facilities for the period of January through November, 2011 as compared to November 15, 2010 to November 30, 2010).
352915_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Sources of Revenue Overview: We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services.
352915_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.
352915_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis.
352915_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.
352915_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage.
352915_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year.
352915_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue.
352915_13_ITEM7_P78_S3	Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payors and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self-pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided.
352915_13_ITEM7_P78_S4	Since a significant portion of our revenues are derived from facilities located in Nevada, Texas and California, we are particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in those states.
352915_13_ITEM7_P78_S5	Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
352915_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years (excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements) for: (i) our Acute Care and Behavioral Health Care Facilities Combined; (ii) our Acute Care Facilities, and; (iii) our Behavioral Health Care Facilities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.
352915_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease.
352915_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.
352915_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ).
352915_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge.
352915_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s Medicare severity diagnosis related group ( MS-DRG ).
352915_13_ITEM7_P81_S3	Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis.
352915_13_ITEM7_P81_S4	The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care.
352915_13_ITEM7_P81_S5	This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG.
352915_13_ITEM7_P81_S6	The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity.
352915_13_ITEM7_P81_S7	While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patient s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.
352915_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1.
352915_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the hospital market basket index, gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services.
352915_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	In July, 2010, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) published its final IPPS 2011 payment rule which provided for a 2.6% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments were considered, our overall decrease from the federal fiscal year 2011 rule was 1.1%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS was also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	In August, 2011, CMS published its final IPPS 2012 payment rule which provided for a 3.0% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	Health Care Reform productivity adjustments are considered, we estimate that our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2012 rule was approximately 0.6%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	CMS also includes a 2.0% market basket reduction related to prior year documentation and coding adjustments as well as a 1.1% increase related to the correction of a prior year wage index budget neutrality adjustment.
352915_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	discussion below, CMS was also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.10% in federal fiscal year 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	The projected impact from this IPPS rule noted above reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph.
352915_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	In August, 2012, CMS published its final IPPS 2013 payment rule which provided for a 2.6% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2013 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013) will approximate 1.8%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	This projected impact from the IPPS 2013 final rule reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph, however, it excludes the impact of potential reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.
352915_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	In September, 2007, the TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007 legislation took effect and scaled back cuts in hospital reimbursement that CMS was set to impose.
352915_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	In federal fiscal years 2010 to 2012, the new law required CMS to make adjustments to the Medicare standardized amounts in these years to reflect the removal of actual aggregate payment increases or decreases for documentation and coding adjustments that occurred during federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 as compared to the initial CMS estimates.
352915_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	In federal fiscal year 2010, CMS made its initial statutory mandated adjustment under this legislation and continued to do so in subsequent fiscal years to ensure the implementation of MS-DRGs was budget neutral among all affected hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	On January 1, 2005, CMS implemented a new Psychiatric Prospective Payment System ( Psych PPS ) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program.
352915_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	This system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics.
352915_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department.
352915_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	According to the April, 2010 CMS notice, the market basket increase was 2.4% for the period of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	In April, 2011 CMS published its final Psych PPS rule for the fifteen month period July 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	The market basket increase for this time period is 2.95%, which includes a 0.25% reduction required by the federal Health Care Reform legislation enacted in 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	In August, 2012 CMS published the federal year 2013 Psych PPS rate notice.
352915_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	The market basket increase for this period is 2.7% less required Health Care Reform legislation reductions totaling 0.8% for a net market basket increase of 1.9%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	In November 2010, CMS published its annual final Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System ( OPPS ) rule for 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	The final market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.46%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.25% in federal fiscal year 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, the overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2011 was approximately 3.2%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	In November, 2011, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	The market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 3.0%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2012 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 1.1%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P93_S3	In the final rule, CMS is also implementing a significant decrease in the 2012 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P93_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS payment decrease for 2012 was estimated to be approximately 0.7%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P93_S5	Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2012 was approximately 2.1%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	In November, 2012, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	The market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.6%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2013 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 0.7%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P94_S3	In the final rule, CMS is also implementing a significant increase in the 2013 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P94_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2013 is estimated to be 3.5%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P94_S5	Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2013 is estimated to be 1.7%.
352915_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_13_ITEM7_P95_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented which, if triggered, would result in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (approximately $39 million reduction to our annual Medicare net revenues) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs starting in 2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act ( ATRA ) of 2012 was enacted and included provisions that resulted in the postponement of the aforementioned across-the-board 2% Medicare payment reductions until at least April, 2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	We cannot predict whether Congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the automatic Medicare budget cuts or what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress.
352915_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	The ATRA of 2012 also includes a requirement for CMS to recoup $11 billion from hospitals from Medicare IPPS rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017.
352915_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	The recoupment relates to IPPS documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by CMS.
352915_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	The 2014 IPPS proposed rule is scheduled to be published by CMS in May, 2013 which will contain the proposed IPPS reduction percentage for FFY2014.
352915_13_ITEM7_P97_S3	In January, 2013, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) indicated that if CMS were to ratably recoup the ATRA of 2012 mandated documentation and coding recoupment from FFYs 2014 to 2017, a 2.4% reduction would be required in each of these federal fiscal years.
352915_13_ITEM7_P97_S4	If implemented in FFYs 2014 to 2017, a 2.4% IPPS reduction would reduce our expected Medicare payment IPPS payment update amount by approximately $18 million annually, commencing in October, 2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	We entered into an agreement in April, 2012 with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and CMS (referred to collectively as HHS ) that resulted in an aggregate cash payment to us of approximately $36 million which was received during 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	After reductions for estimated related expenses and the portion attributable to third-party non-controlling ownership interests, this settlement favorably impacted our 2012 pre-tax consolidated financial results by approximately $30 million (recording during the first quarter of 2012).
352915_13_ITEM7_P98_S2	This agreement was part of an industry-wide settlement with HHS related to litigation that was pending for several years contending that acute care hospitals in the U.S. were underpaid from the Medicare inpatient prospective payment system during a number of prior years.
352915_13_ITEM7_P98_S3	The underpayments resulted from calculations related to rural floor budget neutrality adjustments that were implemented in connection with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
352915_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	Hospital reimbursements ( Medicare DSH ) for federal fiscal years 2006 through 2009.
352915_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	As a result of these new SSI ratios, acute care hospitals are required to recalculate their Medicare DSH for the affected years and record adjustments for differences in estimated reimbursements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	As a result of the unfavorable adjustments required from the revised SSI ratios, and the write-off of receivables from certain counties located in Florida, our 2012 pre-tax consolidated financial results were unfavorably impacted by an aggregate of approximately $8 million (recorded during the first quarter of 2012, net of the portion attributable to third-party non-controlling ownership interests).
352915_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care.
352915_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid.
352915_13_ITEM7_P101_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P101_S5	We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Virginia, Illinois and Massachusetts, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective 2013 state fiscal years) as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_13_ITEM7_P101_S6	In the states in which we operate, based upon the state budgets for the 2012 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2011), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates have been reduced by approximately 3% to 4% (or approximately $45 million to $55 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states 2011 fiscal years (which generally ended during the third quarter of 2011).
352915_13_ITEM7_P101_S7	Our consolidated results of operations during 2012 and 2011 include the pro rata portion of these Medicaid rate reductions.
352915_13_ITEM7_P101_S8	Based upon the state budgets for the 2013 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2012), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates will be reduced by approximately 1% (or approximately $15 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states 2012 fiscal years (which generally ended during the third quarter of 2012).
352915_13_ITEM7_P101_S9	We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hidalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in CMS-approved private Medicaid supplemental payment ( UPL ) programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties.
352915_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	Our hospitals receive both UPL payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM7_P102_S3	The UPL payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer ( IGT ) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM7_P102_S4	We recorded net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of $25 million during 2012, $31 million during 2011 and $38 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P102_S5	If the applicable hospital district or county makes IGTs consistent with 2012 levels, and without giving effect to potential reductions resulting from the February, 2013 THHSC proposed rule, or the potential additional Medicaid UPL revenues related to an affiliation agreement with a government entity, both of which are discussed below, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net revenues earned pursuant to these programs of approximately $25 million during the state fiscal year state 2013 which ends on September 30, 2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	For state fiscal year 2013, Texas Medicaid will continue to operate under a CMS-approved Section 1115 five-year Medicaid waiver demonstration program.
352915_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	During the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission ( THHSC ) transitioned away from UPL payments to new waiver incentive payment programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	During the first year of transition, which commenced on October 1, 2011, THHSC made payments to Medicaid UPL recipient providers that received payments during the state s prior fiscal year.
352915_13_ITEM7_P103_S3	During transition years two through five, THHSC will make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	statewide caps based on CMS approved Medicaid waiver amounts.
352915_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	In February, 2013, THHSC proposed a rule that indicates that any required statewide UPL payment reductions will be applied a pro rata basis to all UPL payment recipients.
352915_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	Although our future UPL payments in Texas may be adversely impacted by this proposed rule, we are unable to estimate the potential impact on us since the amount of the statewide pro rata UPL payment reduction, if any, has not yet been determined by THHSC.
352915_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	Beginning in 2013, we may be entitled to additional Medicaid UPL payments pursuant to an indigent care affiliation agreement entered into between a government entity and one of our acute care hospitals located in Texas.
352915_13_ITEM7_P104_S4	Consistent with other Medicaid UPL programs in Texas, these potential additional Medicaid UPL payments will be contingent on voluntary IGTs made by the government entity.
352915_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	We incur health-care related taxes ( Provider Taxes ) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items of services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services.
352915_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching dollars as part of their respective state Medicaid programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments.
352915_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	Including the impact of the Oklahoma, Indiana and Ohio programs that were initiated during 2012, as mentioned below, we earned an aggregate net benefit of approximately $57 million during 2012 (of which $12 million related to 2011) and $26 million during 2011 from Medicaid supplemental payments, after assessed Provider Taxes were considered.
352915_13_ITEM7_P106_S2	We estimate that our aggregate net benefit from Provider Tax programs will approximate $48 million during 2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P106_S3	The aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P106_S4	However, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	In January, 2012, the state of Oklahoma was granted federal approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) for the Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program ( SHOPP ) which grants the Oklahoma Health Care Authority the authority to assess a 2.5% fee on certain Oklahoma hospitals and to make Medicaid supplemental payments to hospitals through December 31, 2014, retroactive to July 1, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	The state finalized the initial supplemental payment program amounts in March, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the SHOPP program during the state s fiscal years of 2012 and 2013, we estimate that we are entitled to annual net reimbursements of approximately $14 million, retroactive to July 1, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P107_S3	Our 2012 pre-tax consolidated financial results were favorably impacted by approximately $21 million in connection with the SHOPP program covering the period of July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	During the second quarter of 2012, new supplemental Medicaid programs were initiated in Indiana and Ohio in which we operate behavioral health care facilities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	Our 2012 pre-tax consolidated financial results were favorably impacted by approximately $14 million recorded in connection with these programs which were retroactive to July, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	In California, a Medicaid state plan amendment ( SPA ) was submitted to CMS by the state requesting and extension of a prior provider tax and related Medicaid supplemental payment program retroactive to July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	In June, 2012, CMS approved a portion of the SPA which did not have a material impact on our 2012 consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	Approval of the additional SPA component related to Medicaid managed care supplemental payments would have a favorable impact on our future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	State Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital ( DSH ) adjustment.
352915_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.
352915_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas and South Carolina s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state s DSH fund.
352915_13_ITEM7_P111_S2	The South Carolina and Texas DSH programs were renewed for each state s 2013 DSH fiscal year (covering the period of October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013).
352915_13_ITEM7_P111_S3	In February, 2013, the THHSC published a proposed rule that included amounts that are expected to be similar to the 2012 fiscal year program amounts, assuming the Texas DSH program is funded by the public hospitals for the state s 2013 DSH fiscal year.
352915_13_ITEM7_P111_S4	In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $47 million during 2012, $45 million during 2011 and $54 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P111_S5	Assuming that the Texas and South Carolina programs are renewed for each state s 2014 fiscal years, at amounts similar to the 2013 fiscal year estimates, we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be approximately $44 million during 2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P111_S6	Failure to renew these DSH programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive DSH payments to qualify for future DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	HITECH Act: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria.
352915_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P113_S2	State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but we expect that all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate will ultimately choose to participate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P113_S3	Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria.
352915_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	The government s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.
352915_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	During 2011, we began implementing EHR applications at certain of our acute care hospitals and will continue to do so, on a hospital-by-hospital basis, until completion which is scheduled to occur by the end of June, 2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	As of December 31, 2012, EHR applications have been implemented at fourteen of our acute care hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM7_P114_S3	Our acute care hospitals will be eligible for Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application, assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria.
352915_13_ITEM7_P114_S4	As of December 31, 2012, eleven hospitals met the meaningful use criteria.
352915_13_ITEM7_P114_S5	Our 2012 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pre-tax impact of approximately $3 million consisting of approximately $30 million of EHR incentive income (consisting of $18 million of Medicare incentive income and $12 million of Medicaid incentive income) less approximately $15 million of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses, approximately $13 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.
352915_13_ITEM7_P114_S6	As of December 31, 2012, we received an aggregate of approximately $37 million of Medicare ($14 million) and Medicaid ($23 million) EHR incentive payments.
352915_13_ITEM7_P114_S7	These payments, which are/were reflected as deferred EHR incentive income on our consolidated balance sheet (included in other current liabilities), will be/were recorded as EHR incentive income in our consolidated statements of income in the applicable periods pursuant to our EHR incentive income accounting policies, as disclosed above.
352915_13_ITEM7_P114_S8	Upon meeting the meaningful use criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid incentive payments in future periods.
352915_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	We previously classified approximately $2 million of EHR incentive income as net revenues in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P115_S1	That amount has been reclassified and is now included in the line item EHR incentive income in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_13_ITEM7_P116_S2	Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_13_ITEM7_P116_S3	Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act.
352915_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P117_S1	In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow.
352915_13_ITEM7_P117_S2	The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate.
352915_13_ITEM7_P117_S3	Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.
352915_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance.
352915_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy.
352915_13_ITEM7_P118_S2	Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.
352915_13_ITEM7_P118_S3	Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services.
352915_13_ITEM7_P118_S4	To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage.
352915_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy.
352915_13_ITEM7_P119_S2	Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.
352915_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	The Affordable Care Act established the Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Demonstration Project Act which created a three-year $75 million demonstration program to allow coverage for adults in freestanding psychiatric facilities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	This proposal allows states to remove the Medicaid Institution for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion for Medicaid patients between the ages of 21-64 who are receiving care in freestanding non-governmental psychiatric hospitals to stabilize their emergency psychiatric condition.
352915_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:
352915_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM7_P122_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, the War on Terrorism, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, the expansion of a Medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future.
352915_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the Reconciliation Act ) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the Affordable Care Act ), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs.
352915_13_ITEM7_P124_S1	Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.
352915_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	Immediate Medicare Reductions: The Reconciliation Act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities by 0.25% in each of 2010 and 2011 and by 0.10% in 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	Further, the Affordable Care Act implements certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P125_S2	Future Medicare Reductions: Future changes to the Medicare program include:
352915_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	During 2012, we recorded $107 million in Medicare DSH payments from the Medicare traditional fee for service ( FFS ) program.
352915_13_ITEM7_P126_S1	We expect that CMS will publish a proposed rule during the second quarter of 2013 that implements the above-mentioned reduction to Medicare DSH payments pursuant to the Affordable Care Act.
352915_13_ITEM7_P126_S2	Although we are not yet able to quantify the ultimate impact of these reductions on our future results of operations, based on our preliminary internal projections, we estimate that this provision could reduce our annual Medicare FFS DSH payments by 40% to 50% starting October 1, 2013.
352915_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	Although the above-mentioned Medicare market basket reductions implemented in 2010 did not have a material impact on our results of operations to date, we are unable to estimate the future impact of the other legislative changes as outlined above.
352915_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	Value-Based Purchasing: There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services.
352915_13_ITEM7_P128_S1	These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates.
352915_13_ITEM7_P129_S1	In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events.
352915_13_ITEM7_P129_S2	Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.
352915_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing.
352915_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	The Affordable Care Act prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions ( HAC ).
352915_13_ITEM7_P131_S1	Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments.
352915_13_ITEM7_P131_S2	Hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.
352915_13_ITEM7_P131_S3	The Affordable Care Act also required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P131_S4	The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in FFY 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years.
352915_13_ITEM7_P131_S5	HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS.
352915_13_ITEM7_P131_S6	HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions.
352915_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations ( ACOs ).
352915_13_ITEM7_P132_S1	The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services.
352915_13_ITEM7_P132_S2	The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency.
352915_13_ITEM7_P132_S3	ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.
352915_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P133_S1	The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions.
352915_13_ITEM7_P133_S2	We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments.
352915_13_ITEM7_P133_S3	Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.
352915_13_ITEM7_P133_S4	Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_13_ITEM7_P133_S5	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM7_P133_S6	Other Operating Results Combined revenues from our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers were $16 million during 2012, $15 million during 2011 and $17 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	before income taxes earned in connection with the revenues mentioned above was ($2 million) during 2012, $2 million during 2011 and $5 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P134_S1	Interest Expense Below is a schedule of our interest expense during 2012, 2011 and 2010 (amounts in thousands):
352915_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	Pursuant to the terms of these notes, which were assumed by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI, notice of redemption was provided by us as of the acquisition date and the indenture was satisfied and discharged and these notes were subsequently redeemed on December 15, 2010 utilizing borrowed funds which were held in escrow from November 15, 2010 to the date of redemption.
352915_13_ITEM7_P136_S0	In September, 2012, we entered into a Second Amendment to our credit agreement, dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended on March 15, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P136_S1	The Second Amendment provides for a new $900 million Term Loan-A ( Term Loan A2 ) with a final maturity date of August 15, 2016 and extends the maturity date on the majority of the existing revolving credit facility and Term Loan-A by nine months to mature on August 15, 2016.
352915_13_ITEM7_P136_S2	The Second Amendment also provides for increased flexibility for refinancing and certain other modifications but substantially all other terms of the Credit Agreement as previously amended, including interest rates, remain unchanged.
352915_13_ITEM7_P137_S0	We used $700 million of the proceeds from the new Term Loan A2 to extinguish a portion of our higher priced, existing Term Loan-B facility.
352915_13_ITEM7_P137_S1	The remainder of the new Term Loan A2 was used to pay transaction related fees and expenses and to repay other floating rate debt.
352915_13_ITEM7_P137_S2	Interest expense decreased $22 million during 2012 to $179 million as compared to $201 million during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P137_S3	The decreased interest expense during 2012 was due primarily to: (i) a $29 million decrease in interest expense due primarily to a decrease in our average effective borrowing rate (due in part to the repayment of the $200 million, 6.75% Senior Notes in November, 2011, utilizing borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement which are borrowed at a lower interest rate and, as mentioned above in (a.)), the extinguishment (during the third quarter of 2012) of $700 million of borrowings pursuant to our Term Loan B with proceeds from the new Term Loan A2 which are borrowed at a lower interest rate; (ii) a $5 million decrease in interest expense due to an increase in interest being capitalized on major construction projects, partially offset by; (iii) a $12 million increase in interest expense due to an increase in our net interest rate swap expense.
352915_13_ITEM7_P138_S0	The aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement (consisting of the revolving credit, Term Loan A, Term Loan B and Term Loan A2 facilities), demand notes and accounts receivable securitization program were $2.9 billion during each of 2012 and 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P138_S1	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 4.5% during 2012 and 4.6% during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P138_S2	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 2.9% during 2012 and 3.4% during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P138_S3	Interest expense increased $123 million during 2011 to $201 million as compared to $78 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P138_S4	This increase was due primarily to: (i) the increased average outstanding borrowings resulting from the borrowed funds utilized to finance our purchase of PSI in November, 2010; (ii) the increased interest expense incurred during 2011 on the $250 million, 7.00% senior notes issued in September, 2010, and; (iii) the increased expense resulting from the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred on the various debt facilities utilized to finance the purchase of PSI.
352915_13_ITEM7_P138_S5	During 2011, the aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement (consisting of the revolving credit, Term Loan A and Term Loan B facilities), demand notes and accounts receivable securitization program were $2.9 billion as compared to $610 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P138_S6	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, including the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 4.6% during 2011 and 5.0% during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P138_S7	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 3.4% during each of 2011 and 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	Transaction Costs During 2012, we incurred approximately $6 million of transaction costs in connection with our acquisition of 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P139_S1	These costs consisted primarily of legal, investment banking and consulting fees.
352915_13_ITEM7_P139_S2	During 2010, we incurred $53 million of transaction costs in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, consisting of the following:
352915_13_ITEM7_P140_S0	Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_13_ITEM7_P141_S0	Outside owners hold various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in seven of our acute care facilities and one behavioral health care facility.
352915_13_ITEM7_P141_S1	Each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies ( LLC ) or limited partnerships ( LP ).
352915_13_ITEM7_P141_S2	As a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit.
352915_13_ITEM7_P141_S3	When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members /partners share of the income generated by the joint-venture entities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	In addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners.
352915_13_ITEM7_P142_S1	The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands): The impact of the discrete tax items did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes during 2012 or 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P142_S2	Impacting the effective tax rates during 2010 were the following items: (i) $5 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust the non-deductible portion of certain transaction costs incurred during 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI; (ii) a $4 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust for the non-deductible, $9 million charge incurred from split-dollar life insurance agreements entered into during 2010 on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife, partially offset by; (iii) a $4 million favorable discrete tax item recorded during 2010 to adjust the estimated non-deductible portion of the previously disclosed South Texas Health System settlement with the government based upon the final agreement.
352915_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	Discontinued Operations In October of 2012, we completed the divestiture of Auburn Regional Medical Center ( Auburn ), a 159-bed acute care hospital located in Auburn, Washington, for total cash proceeds of approximately $93 million.
352915_13_ITEM7_P143_S1	This divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $26 million which was included in our 2012 consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P144_S0	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture, within approximately six months, of Peak Behavioral Health Services ( Peak ), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
352915_13_ITEM7_P144_S1	The revenues of Peak were approximately $18 million and $14 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities as well as one of our legacy behavioral health facilities in Puerto Rico.
352915_13_ITEM7_P145_S1	Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we divested:
352915_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	in January, 2012, the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, a 108-bed facility located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.
352915_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	The operating results for Auburn, Peak and the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership during each of the years presented herein.
352915_13_ITEM7_P147_S1	Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.
352915_13_ITEM7_P147_S2	As reflected on the table below, the aggregate pre-tax net gain on the divestiture of Auburn, which was recorded during 2012, was approximately $26 million.
352915_13_ITEM7_P147_S3	The aggregate pre-tax net gain on the divestiture of San Juan Capestrano in January, 2012 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P147_S4	Assets and liabilities for Peak are reflected as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012, and the assets and liabilities for the Hospital San Juan Capestrano were reflected as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	The following table shows the results of operations for Auburn and Peak and the former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada, on a combined basis, which were reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership for each of the years presented herein (amounts in thousands): Effects of Inflation and Seasonality Seasonality Our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_13_ITEM7_P148_S1	This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.
352915_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	Inflation Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years.
352915_13_ITEM7_P149_S1	However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases.
352915_13_ITEM7_P149_S2	Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices.
352915_13_ITEM7_P149_S3	We believe, however, that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.
352915_13_ITEM7_P150_S0	Liquidity Year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to December 31, 2011:
352915_13_ITEM7_P150_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $815 million during 2012 and $718 million during 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7_P150_S2	The net increase of $97 million was primarily attributable to the following:
352915_13_ITEM7_P151_S0	$4 million of other combined net favorable changes.
352915_13_ITEM7_P152_S0	Days sales outstanding ( DSO ): Our DSO are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the year.
352915_13_ITEM7_P152_S1	The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance the end of the year.
352915_13_ITEM7_P152_S2	Our DSO were 56 days at December 31, 2012, 51 days at December 31, 2011 and 47 days at December 31, 2010.
352915_13_ITEM7_P152_S3	Contributing to the increase in our DSO as of December 31, 2012, as compared to December 31, 2011, was an increase in receivables from the state of Illinois.
352915_13_ITEM7_P152_S4	As of December 31, 2012, our accounts receivable includes $70 million due from Illinois ($54 million as of December 31, 2011), the collection of which has been delayed due to budgetary and funding pressures experienced by the state.
352915_13_ITEM7_P152_S5	Although as of December 31, 2012 approximately $51 million of the receivables due from Illinois have been outstanding in excess of 60 days ($41 million as of December 31, 2011), and a large portion will likely remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us and therefore no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM7_P152_S6	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois.
352915_13_ITEM7_P152_S7	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
352915_13_ITEM7_P152_S8	Excluding the $51 million and $41 million of receivables from Illinois that have been outstanding in excess of 60 days as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, our DSO were 54 days and 49 days at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM7_P153_S0	Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $790 million during 2012 as compared to $286 million during 2011.

352915_13_ITEM7_P182_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had $14 million of outstanding borrowings under a short-term, on-demand credit facility.
352915_13_ITEM7_P182_S2	Outstanding borrowings pursuant to this facility are classified as long-term on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since we have the intent and ability to refinance through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement.
352915_13_ITEM7_P183_S0	Quarterly installment payments ( Installment Payments ) are due on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities which are equal to approximately $72 million in 2013, $72 million in 2014, $77 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2016.

352915_13_ITEM7_P185_S0	Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals ( Receivables ) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings.

352915_13_ITEM7_P185_S4	The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P185_S5	The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_13_ITEM7_P185_S6	The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans.
352915_13_ITEM7_P185_S7	At December 31, 2012, we had $249 million of outstanding borrowings and $26 million of additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_13_ITEM7_P185_S8	In the event we do not either enter into a new financing agreement, or an agreement to extend the scheduled maturity date of the Securitization, we expect to have the borrowing capacity and would intend to refinance the Securitization upon its scheduled maturity utilizing borrowings under our Credit Agreement.
352915_13_ITEM7_P185_S9	Therefore, outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2012 under the Securitization are classified as long-term on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

352915_13_ITEM7_P197_S0	(e) Consists of $208 million of estimated future payments related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan (estimated through 2087), as disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , and $17 million of estimated future payments related to another retirement plan liability.
352915_13_ITEM7_P197_S1	Included in our other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2012 was a $10 million liability recorded in connection with the non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan and a $13 million liability recorded in connection with the other retirement plan.
352915_13_ITEM7_P197_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $279 million, of which $48 million is included in other current liabilities and $231 million is included in other non-current liabilities.
352915_13_ITEM7_P197_S3	We exclude the $279 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments.
352915_13_ITEM7_P197_S4	Please see Self-Insured Risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.
352915_13_ITEM7_P198_S0	In connection with five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain put rights , that are currently exercisable, that if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member s interests at fair market value.
352915_13_ITEM7_P198_S1	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.
352915_13_ITEM7_P199_S0	In connection with a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the PSI acquisition, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_13_ITEM7_P199_S1	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_13_ITEM7_P199_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities, pursuant to the terms of the put options, approximates the $234 million aggregate book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests.
352915_13_ITEM7_P199_S3	We exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these minority ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertainty as to: (i) whether or not the put rights will actually be exercised; (ii) the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were exercised, and; (iii) the timing of such payments.
352915_13_ITEM7_P199_S4	Additionally, the table above does not include $7 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7_P200_S0	Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be utilized.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P3_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2012 and 2011 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	However, at December 31, 2012, each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S2	We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S3	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S4	During the first quarter of 2011, we entered into an interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $275 million whereby we paid a premium of $30,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 2.25% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 2.25% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S5	The three-month LIBOR never reached 2.25% during the term of the cap.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S6	Therefore, no payment was made to us.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S7	We also entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $450 million from December, 2011 to December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December, 2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S8	If the three-month LIBOR does not reach 7.00% during the term of the cap, no payment is made to us.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S9	We also entered into six additional forward starting interest rate swaps in the first quarter of 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $425 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S10	Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S11	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 1.91%.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P6_S12	The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $100 million, $25 million and $75 million became effective in December, 2011 and have fixed rates of 2.50%, 1.96% and 1.32%, and maturity dates in December, 2014, December, 2013 and December, 2012, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, we entered into three interest rate caps on a total notional amount of $1 billion whereby we paid a premium of $240,000 in exchange for the counterparties agreeing to pay the difference between 2.25% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 2.25% during the term of the caps.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	All of these caps expired in December, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The three-month LIBOR rate never rose above 2.25% during the term of the caps.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P7_S3	Therefore, no payments were made to us.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Each of the four swaps became effective in December, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of $150 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Each of the two interest rate swaps had an initial notional principal amount of $75 million.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The notional amount of the first interest rate swap reduced to $50 million in October, 2010.The fixed rate payable was 4.76% and it matured in October, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P9_S3	The fixed rate payable on the second interest rate swap was 4.87% and it matured in October, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P10_S2	We consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $41 million at December 31, 2012, substantially all of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P11_S1	At December 31, 2011, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $48 million, of which $4 million is included in other current liabilities and $44 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P12_S0	The table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P12_S1	For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.
352915_13_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Ending December 31 (Dollars in thousands) As calculated based upon our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2012 that is subject to interest rate fluctuations, each 1% change in interest rates would impact our pre-tax income by approximately $21 million.

352915_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the SEC rules thereunder.
352915_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the fourth quarter of 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
352915_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	In October, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation.
352915_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	We are in the process of transferring all accounting for the new acquisition to our headquarters and into our existing internal control procedures.
352915_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	The integration may lead to changes in these controls in future periods but we do not expect these changes to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
352915_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over our financial reporting.
352915_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria on Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
352915_13_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Based on its assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the COSO.
352915_13_ITEM9A_P3_S4	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein.

352915_13_ITEM15_P13_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Health Services, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
352915_13_ITEM15_P13_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P13_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_13_ITEM15_P13_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, financial statement schedule, and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in item 9A as Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
352915_13_ITEM15_P13_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
352915_13_ITEM15_P13_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
352915_13_ITEM15_P13_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
352915_13_ITEM15_P13_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
352915_13_ITEM15_P13_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
352915_13_ITEM15_P13_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
352915_13_ITEM15_P13_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
352915_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_13_ITEM15_P14_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P14_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P14_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
352915_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting , management has excluded Ascend Health Corporation and its subsidiaries from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2012.
352915_13_ITEM15_P15_S1	We have also excluded Ascend Health Corporation from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.
352915_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	Ascend Health Corporation and its subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues represent 6% and 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1) BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Services provided by our hospitals, all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.
352915_13_ITEM15_P22_S1	We, through our subsidiaries, provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
352915_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	The more significant accounting policies follow: A) Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner.
352915_13_ITEM15_P23_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
352915_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 39% of our net patient revenues during 2012, 41% during 2011 and 42% during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P24_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 49% of our net patient revenues during 2012, 47% during 2011 and 51% during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P24_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_13_ITEM15_P24_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_13_ITEM15_P24_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_13_ITEM15_P24_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P24_S7	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_13_ITEM15_P24_S8	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_13_ITEM15_P25_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_13_ITEM15_P25_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P25_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P26_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2012, 2011 or 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_13_ITEM15_P27_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care and Uninsured Discounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	C) Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_13_ITEM15_P28_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_13_ITEM15_P28_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_13_ITEM15_P28_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_13_ITEM15_P28_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_13_ITEM15_P28_S6	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_13_ITEM15_P28_S7	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of a minimum of 30% of total charges.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S2	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S3	Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S4	As of December 31, 2012, our accounts receivable includes $70 million due from Illinois ($54 million as of December 31, 2011), the collection of which has been delayed due to budgetary and funding pressures experienced by the state.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S5	Although as of December 31, 2012 approximately $51 million of the receivables due from Illinois have been outstanding in excess of 60 days ($41 million as of December 31, 2011), and a large portion will likely remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us and therefore no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S6	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S7	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S8	On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S9	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $311 million and $253 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S10	D) Concentration of Revenues: Our five majority owned acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined basis, 14% in 2012, 15% in 2011 and 20% in 2010, of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_13_ITEM15_P30_S11	On a combined basis, our facilities in the McAllen/Edinburg, Texas market (consisting of three acute care facilities, a children s hospital and a behavioral health facility) contributed 4% in 2012, 5% in 2011 and 6% in 2010, of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	E) Charity Care and Uninsured Discounts: A significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_13_ITEM15_P32_S2	We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in uninsured discounts amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_13_ITEM15_P32_S3	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_13_ITEM15_P33_S2	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:
352915_13_ITEM15_P33_S3	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_13_ITEM15_P33_S4	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_13_ITEM15_P33_S5	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	F) Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
352915_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	The regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_13_ITEM15_P34_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_13_ITEM15_P34_S3	We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
352915_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	Medicare EHR incentive payments: Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	Medicaid EHR incentive payments: Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals meet the meaningful use criteria.
352915_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurs in the period in which the applicable hospitals are deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria.
352915_13_ITEM15_P36_S2	Upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods.
352915_13_ITEM15_P36_S3	Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria are included in other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	G) Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
352915_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	H) Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost.
352915_13_ITEM15_P37_S2	Expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts.
352915_13_ITEM15_P37_S3	Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred.
352915_13_ITEM15_P37_S4	We remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	Construction-in-progress includes both construction projects and equipment not yet placed into service.
352915_13_ITEM15_P38_S1	We capitalize interest expense on major construction projects while in progress.
352915_13_ITEM15_P38_S2	We capitalized interest on major construction projects and the development and implementation of electronic health records applications amounting to $5.7 million during 2012, $400,000 during 2011 and $7.6 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years).
352915_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	Depreciation expense (excluding discontinued operations) was $270.5 million during 2012, $262.1 million during 2011 and $197.3 million during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	I) Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_13_ITEM15_P40_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_13_ITEM15_P41_S2	We have designated September 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2012 which indicated no impairment of goodwill.
352915_13_ITEM15_P41_S3	There were also no goodwill impairments during 2011 or 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P41_S4	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill.
352915_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2012 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	(a) Consists of adjustments to prior year purchase price allocations.
352915_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	(b) The reduction to the Behavioral Health Services goodwill consists primarily of a reclassification to assets of facilities held for sale and represents the goodwill attributable to Peak Behavioral Health Services which we agreed to divest pursuant to our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM15_P44_S1	Adjustments to prior year purchase price allocations for Acute Care and Behavioral Health Services are also included.
352915_13_ITEM15_P44_S2	Other Assets: Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010 and Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012, consisting of Medicare licenses, certificates of need and contracts to manage the operations of behavioral health services owned by third-parties (PSI only); (ii) prepaid fees for various software and other applications used by our hospitals; (iii) costs incurred in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities; (iv) deposits; (v) investments in various businesses, including Universal Health Realty Income Trust; (vi) the invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related payable included in other noncurrent liabilities; (vii) the estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and; (viii) other miscellaneous assets.
352915_13_ITEM15_P44_S3	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $99 million and $97 million, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	L) Physician Guarantees and Commitments: As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, our accrued liabilities-other, and our other assets included $3 million and $7 million, respectively, of estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments.
352915_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	Pursuant to contractual guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2012 that are applicable to future years, we have $3 million of potential future financial obligations, substantially all of which are potential obligations during 2013.
352915_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	M) Self-Insured Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_13_ITEM15_P46_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_13_ITEM15_P46_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_13_ITEM15_P46_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_13_ITEM15_P46_S5	See Note 8 for discussion of adjustments to our prior year reserves for claims related to our self-insured general and professional liability and workers compensation liability.
352915_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	In addition, we also maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	The ultimate costs related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	N) Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_13_ITEM15_P50_S2	See Note 6 for additional disclosure regarding income taxes.
352915_13_ITEM15_P50_S3	Other Noncurrent Liabilities: Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general liability, workers compensation reserves, pension and deferred compensation liabilities, liability incurred in connection with split-dollar life insurance agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife and interest rate swap liabilities.
352915_13_ITEM15_P50_S4	Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest:
352915_13_ITEM15_P50_S5	Outside owners hold noncontrolling, minority ownership interests of: (i) approximately 28% in our five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada; (ii) 20% in an acute care facility located in Washington, D.C.; (iii) approximately 11% in an acute care facility located in Laredo, Texas, and; (iv) 20% in a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the majority ownership interest of which was acquired by us as result of our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P50_S6	The redeemable noncontrolling interest balances of $234 million and $218 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and the noncontrolling interest balances of $53 million and $51 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, consist primarily of the third-party ownership interests in these hospitals.
352915_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	In connection with the five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain put rights , that are currently exercisable, that if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member s interests at fair market value.
352915_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.
352915_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	In connection with the behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_13_ITEM15_P52_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities, pursuant to the terms of the put options, approximates the book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests.
352915_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	Q) Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive income or loss is comprised of net income, changes in unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and a pension liability.
352915_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	The accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) component of stockholders equity includes: net unrealized gains and losses on effective cash flow hedges; and the net minimum pension liability of a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan which covers employees at one of our subsidiaries.
352915_13_ITEM15_P53_S2	See Note 10, Pension Plan for additional disclosure regarding the defined benefit pension plan.
352915_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	The amounts recognized in AOCI for the two years ended December 31, 2012 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	R ) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities: We manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_13_ITEM15_P54_S2	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_13_ITEM15_P55_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_13_ITEM15_P55_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_13_ITEM15_P55_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within stockholders equity.
352915_13_ITEM15_P55_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_13_ITEM15_P55_S5	Changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges are classified as operating on our cash flow statement.
352915_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_13_ITEM15_P56_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_13_ITEM15_P56_S3	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
352915_13_ITEM15_P56_S4	Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.
352915_13_ITEM15_P56_S5	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	S) Stock-Based Compensation: At December 31, 2012, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans.
352915_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	Pursuant to the FASB s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
352915_13_ITEM15_P57_S2	The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge.
352915_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.
352915_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	The applicable FASB guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows.
352915_13_ITEM15_P58_S2	During 2012, 2011 and 2010, there were no net excess tax benefits generated.
352915_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
352915_13_ITEM15_P59_S1	Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.
352915_13_ITEM15_P59_S2	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated: The Net effect of dilutive stock options and grants based on the treasury stock method , for all years presented above, excludes certain outstanding stock options applicable to each year since the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
352915_13_ITEM15_P59_S3	The excluded weighted-average stock options totaled 2.0 million during 2012, 1.4 million during 2011and 1,000 during 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	U) Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The fair values of our registered debt and investments are based on quoted market prices.
352915_13_ITEM15_P60_S1	The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar maturities and credit quality.
352915_13_ITEM15_P60_S2	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
352915_13_ITEM15_P60_S3	Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	V) Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
352915_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
352915_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	W) Mergers and Acquisitions: The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions.
352915_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
352915_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
352915_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred.
352915_13_ITEM15_P63_S3	The fair value of intangible assets, including Medicare Licenses, Certificates of Need, and certain contracts, is based on significant judgments made by our management, and accordingly, for significant items we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.
352915_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	No. 2011-07, Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities, which required certain health care entities to change the presentation in their statement of operations by reclassifying the provision for bad debts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts).
352915_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	As a result, the provision for doubtful accounts for our acute care and behavioral health care facilities is reflected as a deduction from net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for 2012, 2011 and 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P64_S2	The adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial position or overall results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	Presentation of Comprehensive Income: In June 2011, the FASB amended its guidance governing the presentation of comprehensive income.
352915_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	The amended guidance eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity.
352915_13_ITEM15_P65_S2	Under the new guidance, an entity can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate, but consecutive, statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P65_S3	While the options for presenting other comprehensive income change under the guidance, other portions of the current guidance will not change.
352915_13_ITEM15_P65_S4	For public entities, these changes are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	2) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES Year ended December 31, 2012: 2012 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2012, we spent $528 million to acquire the following assets and businesses:
352915_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	spent $25 million in connection with the acquisition of physician practices and various real property.
352915_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows: Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price.
352915_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities: (i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.
352915_13_ITEM15_P69_S2	Assuming the acquisition of Ascend occurred on January 1, 2011, our 2011 pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $6.90 billion and our pro forma net income attributable to UHS and pro forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $401 million and $4.06 per diluted share, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM15_P69_S3	The 2011 pro forma net income attributable to UHS and pro forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share include the after-tax impact of the transaction costs incurred by us in connection with the acquisition of Ascend amounting to $5 million or $.06 per diluted share.
352915_13_ITEM15_P69_S4	Our 2012 pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $7.11 billion and our pro forma net income attributable to UHS and pro forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $464 million and $4.74 per diluted share, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM15_P69_S5	During the period of October 10, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the facilities acquired from Ascend generated $42 million of net revenues which are included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM15_P69_S6	The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the date of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, and less the above-mentioned transaction costs, was not material to our 2012 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	2012 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: During 2012, we received $149 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:
352915_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	received an aggregate of $6 million for the sale of the real property of two non-operating behavioral health facilities and our majority ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center located in Puerto Rico.
352915_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	conditions, including the divestiture, within approximately six months, of Peak Behavioral Health Services ( Peak ), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
352915_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	The revenues of Peak were approximately $18 million and $14 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities as well as one of our legacy behavioral health facilities in Puerto Rico.
352915_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we divested:
352915_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	in January, 2012, the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, a 108-bed facility located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.
352915_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	The operating results for Auburn, Peak and the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership during each of the years presented herein.
352915_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.
352915_13_ITEM15_P75_S2	As reflected on the table below, the aggregate pre-tax gain on the divestiture of Auburn, was approximately $26 million.
352915_13_ITEM15_P75_S3	The aggregate pre-tax net gain on the divestiture of San Juan Capestrano in January, 2012 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2012.
352915_13_ITEM15_P75_S4	Assets and liabilities for Peak are reflected as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012, and the assets and liabilities for the Hospital San Juan Capestrano were reflected as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	The following table shows the results of operations for Auburn and Peak and the former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada, on a combined basis, which were reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership for each of the years presented herein (amounts in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2011: 2011 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2011, we spent $29 million on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:
352915_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	The aggregate net cash expenditure related to the properties and/or businesses was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows: 2011 Divestitures of Assets and Businesses: During 2011, we received $68 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:
352915_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	the real property of a closed acute care hospital The aggregate pre-tax net gain on the divestitures of the above-mentioned facilities located in Delaware and Nevada did not have a material impact on our 2011 consolidated results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	Year ended December 31, 2010: 2010 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2010, we spent $1.96 billion and assumed $1.08 billion of debt on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:
352915_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of an outpatient surgery center located in Florida in which we previously held a 20% minority ownership interest.
352915_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	The purchase price consideration in connection with this transaction, which occurred during the first quarter, consisted of acquisition of the net assets less the assumption of the outstanding liabilities and third-party debt.
352915_13_ITEM15_P80_S2	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:
352915_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price.
352915_13_ITEM15_P81_S1	The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities: (i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.
352915_13_ITEM15_P81_S2	Assuming the acquisition of PSI occurred on January 1, 2009, our 2010 pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $7.30 billion and our pro forma net income attributable to UHS and pro forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $342 million and $3.47 per diluted share, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM15_P81_S3	During the period of November 16, 2010 through December 31, 2010, the facilities acquired from PSI generated $227 million of net revenues which are included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P81_S4	The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the date of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, was not material to our 2010 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	Year ended December 31, 2010: 2010 Divestitures of Assets and Businesses: During 2010, we received $21 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:
352915_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	the sale of the real property of Methodist Hospital located in Louisiana that was severely damaged and closed in 2005 as a result of Hurricane Katrina.
352915_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	The pre-tax gain, net of losses, resulting from the above-mentioned transactions did not have a material impact on our 2010 financial statements.
352915_13_ITEM15_P83_S2	3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges: During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we had no fair value hedges outstanding.
352915_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	Cash Flow Hedges: We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_13_ITEM15_P84_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_13_ITEM15_P85_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_13_ITEM15_P85_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_13_ITEM15_P85_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_13_ITEM15_P86_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_13_ITEM15_P86_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2012 and 2011 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_13_ITEM15_P88_S2	We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S1	However, at December 31, 2012, each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S2	We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S3	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S4	During the first quarter of 2011, we entered into an interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $275 million whereby we paid a premium of $30,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 2.25% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 2.25% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S5	The three-month LIBOR never reached 2.25% during the term of the cap.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S6	Therefore, no payment was made to us.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S7	We also entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $450 million from December, 2011 to December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December, 2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S8	If the three-month LIBOR does not reach 7.00% during the term of the cap, no payment is made to us.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S9	We also entered into six additional forward starting interest rate swaps in the first quarter of 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $425 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S10	Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S11	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 1.91%.
352915_13_ITEM15_P89_S12	The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $100 million, $25 million and $75 million became effective in December, 2011 and have fixed rates of 2.50%, 1.96% and 1.32%, and maturity dates in December, 2014, December, 2013 and December, 2012, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, we entered into three interest rate caps on a total notional amount of $1 billion whereby we paid a premium of $240,000 in exchange for the counterparties agreeing to pay the difference between 2.25% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 2.25% during the term of the caps.
352915_13_ITEM15_P90_S1	All of these caps expired in December, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM15_P90_S2	The three-month LIBOR rate never rose above 2.25% during the term of the caps.
352915_13_ITEM15_P90_S3	Therefore, no payments were made to us.
352915_13_ITEM15_P90_S4	We also entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of 2010 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $600 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_13_ITEM15_P90_S5	Each of the four swaps became effective in December, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_13_ITEM15_P90_S6	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.
352915_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of $150 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	swaps had an initial notional principal amount of $75 million.
352915_13_ITEM15_P92_S1	The notional amount of the first interest rate swap reduced to $50 million in October, 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P92_S2	The fixed rate payable was 4.76% and it matured in October, 2012.
352915_13_ITEM15_P92_S3	The fixed rate payable on the second interest rate swap was 4.87% and it matured in October, 2011.
352915_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis.
352915_13_ITEM15_P93_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks.
352915_13_ITEM15_P93_S2	We consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities.
352915_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $41 million at December 31, 2012, substantially all of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.
352915_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	At December 31, 2011, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $48 million, of which $4 million is included in other current liabilities and $44 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.
352915_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	4) LONG-TERM DEBT A summary of long-term debt follows: On September 21, 2012, we entered into a second amendment ( Second Amendment ) to our credit agreement, dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended on March 15, 2011, with several banks and other financial institutions ( Credit Agreement ).
352915_13_ITEM15_P95_S1	The Second Amendment, provides for a new $900 million Term Loan-A ( Term Loan A2 ) at the same interest rates as our existing Term Loan A and a final maturity date of August 15, 2016.
352915_13_ITEM15_P95_S2	The Second Amendment also provides for the extension of the maturity date on approximately $777 million of our existing $800 million revolving credit facility, and $943 million of our existing Term Loan-A facility, by nine months to mature on August 15, 2016.
352915_13_ITEM15_P95_S3	Approximately $23 million of our revolving credit facility commitment and $45 million of our existing Term Loan-A was not extended and is scheduled to mature on November 15, 2015.
352915_13_ITEM15_P95_S4	The Second Amendment also provides for increased flexibility for refinancing and certain other modifications but substantially all other terms of the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 15, 2010 and as previously amended in March, 2011, including interest rates, remain unchanged.
352915_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	On September 21, 2012, we used $700 million of the proceeds from the new Term Loan-A2 facility to extinguish a portion of our higher priced, Term Loan-B facility.
352915_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	Current pricing under the new Term Loan-A2 facility is 1% lower than the Term Loan-B facility and does not include a LIBOR Floor whereas the Term Loan-B facility has a 1% LIBOR Floor.
352915_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	During the third quarter of 2012, in connection with the extinguishment of a portion of our Term Loan-B facility, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $29 million to write-off the related portion of the Term Loan-B deferred financing costs.
352915_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Credit Agreement, as amended on September 21, 2012, is a senior secured facility which provides for an initial aggregate commitment amount of $3.43 billion, comprised of an $800 million revolving credit facility, a $988 million Term Loan-A facility, a $746 million Term Loan-B facility and a $900 million Term Loan-A2 facility.
352915_13_ITEM15_P98_S1	The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit.
352915_13_ITEM15_P98_S2	The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
352915_13_ITEM15_P98_S3	Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the lender s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month Eurodollar rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan- A2 borrowings and 1.75% to 2.00% for Term Loan B borrowings or (2) the one, two, three or six month Eurodollar rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan- A2 borrowings and ranging from 2.75% to 3.00% for Term Loan-B borrowings.
352915_13_ITEM15_P98_S4	The current applicable margins are 0.75% for ABR-based loans, 1.75% for Eurodollar-based loans under the revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities and 2.75% under the Term Loan-B facility.
352915_13_ITEM15_P98_S5	The minimum Eurodollar rate for the Term Loan-B facility is 1.00% ( LIBOR Floor ).
352915_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we had $574 million of available borrowing capacity pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility, net of $164 million of outstanding borrowings (including borrowings outstanding pursuant to a short-term, on-demand credit facility) and $62 million of outstanding letters of credit.
352915_13_ITEM15_P99_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had $14 million of outstanding borrowings under a short-term, on-demand credit facility.
352915_13_ITEM15_P99_S2	Outstanding borrowings pursuant to this facility are classified as long-term on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since we have the intent and ability to refinance through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement.
352915_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	Quarterly installment payments ( Installment Payments ) are due on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities which are equal to approximately $72 million in 2013, $72 million in 2014, $77 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2016.
352915_13_ITEM15_P100_S1	No Installment Payments are due on the Term Loan-B facility.
352915_13_ITEM15_P100_S2	During 2012, we made scheduled principal payments of $13 million on the Term Loan B facility and $42 million on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan A2 facilities.
352915_13_ITEM15_P100_S3	In 2011, we made scheduled principal payments of $16 million on the Term Loan-B facility and $26 million on the Term Loan-A facility.
352915_13_ITEM15_P100_S4	The Installment Payments due in 2013 on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities are classified as long-term on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since we expect to have the borrowing capacity and would intend to refinance through available borrowings under the terms of our Credit Agreement.
352915_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	Our accounts receivable securitization program ( Securitization ) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks was amended in October, 2010.
352915_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	We increased the size of the Securitization from $200 million to $240 million (the Commitments ), and extended the maturity date to October 25, 2013.
352915_13_ITEM15_P101_S2	In May, 2012, we further increased the size of the securitization by $35 million to $275 million.
352915_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals ( Receivables ) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings.
352915_13_ITEM15_P102_S1	The interest rate on the borrowings is based on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of 0.475% and there is a facility fee of 0.375% required on 102% on the Commitments.
352915_13_ITEM15_P102_S2	We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings.
352915_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	the Securitization; the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us.
352915_13_ITEM15_P103_S1	The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities.
352915_13_ITEM15_P103_S2	The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_13_ITEM15_P103_S3	The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans.
352915_13_ITEM15_P103_S4	At December 31, 2012, we had $249 million of outstanding borrowings and $26 million of additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_13_ITEM15_P103_S5	In the event we do not either enter into a new financing agreement, or an agreement to extend the scheduled maturity date of the Securitization, we expect to have the borrowing capacity and would intend to refinance the Securitization upon its scheduled maturity utilizing borrowings under our Credit Agreement.
352915_13_ITEM15_P103_S6	Therefore, outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2012 under the Securitization are classified as long-term on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
352915_13_ITEM15_P103_S7	Our $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the Unsecured Notes ) are scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018.

352915_13_ITEM15_P103_S11	They are also redeemable in whole or in part at a price of: (i) 103.5% on or after October 1, 2014; (ii) 101.75% on or after October 1, 2015, and; (iii) 100% on or after October 1, 2016.

352915_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the 7.125% Notes ).
352915_13_ITEM15_P104_S1	Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year.

352915_13_ITEM15_P104_S3	Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.
352915_13_ITEM15_P104_S4	During 2001, we issued $200 million of senior notes which have a 6.75% coupon rate and which matured and were paid in full on November 15, 2011 (the 6.75% Notes ).
352915_13_ITEM15_P104_S5	In connection with the entering into of the Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and in accordance with the Indenture dated January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2016) and our 6.75% Notes (which matured and were paid in full in November, 2011) were equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.

352915_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.
352915_13_ITEM15_P115_S1	The applicable FASB guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows.

352915_13_ITEM15_P118_S4	The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions derived from averaging the number of options granted during the most recent five-year period that were granted or have vestings after January 1, 2006.
352915_13_ITEM15_P118_S5	The 2010 weighted-average assumptions were based upon seventeen option grants, the 2011 and 2012 weighted-average assumptions were each based upon eighteen option grants.
352915_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon four year yield in effect at the time of grant.
352915_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	The expected life of the stock options granted was estimated using the historical behavior of employees.

352915_13_ITEM15_P137_S0	Deferred taxes are required to be classified based on the financial statement classification of the related assets and liabilities which give rise to temporary differences.
352915_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
352915_13_ITEM15_P138_S1	The components of deferred taxes are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_13_ITEM15_P138_S2	There was no material impact of deferred taxes recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation.
352915_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands): Impacting the effective tax rates during 2012 was approximately $1 million favorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions.
352915_13_ITEM15_P139_S1	Impacting the effective tax rates during 2011 was approximately $1 million favorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions.
352915_13_ITEM15_P139_S2	Impacting the effective tax rates during 2010 were the following items: (i) $5 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust the non-deductible portion of certain transaction costs incurred during 2010 in connection with our acquisition of PSI; (ii) a $4 million unfavorable discrete tax item recorded to adjust for the non-deductible, $9 million charge incurred from split-dollar life insurance agreements entered into during 2010 on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife, partially offset by; (iii) a $4 million favorable discrete tax item recorded during 2010 to adjust the estimated non-deductible portion of the previously disclosed South Texas Health System settlement with the government based upon the final agreement.
352915_13_ITEM15_P139_S3	A reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows: Included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are prepaid federal, foreign, and state income taxes amounting to approximately $7 million and $25 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM15_P139_S4	The net deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_13_ITEM15_P140_S0	The assets and liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible patient accounts, compensation-related accruals and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self- insurance reserves.
352915_13_ITEM15_P141_S0	At December 31, 2012, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2013 through 2032), and credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $959 million, representing approximately $48 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit).
352915_13_ITEM15_P141_S1	At December 31, 2012, related to the acquisition of PSI, there were federal net operating losses of approximately $1 million expiring in 2022 representing approximately $0.4 million in deferred federal tax benefits and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $9 million expiring through 2021 representing approximately $3 million in deferred foreign tax benefit.
352915_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
352915_13_ITEM15_P142_S1	Based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized.
352915_13_ITEM15_P142_S2	Therefore, valuation allowances of approximately $41 million and $39 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
352915_13_ITEM15_P142_S3	During 2012, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by approximately $2 million due to additional net operating losses incurred.
352915_13_ITEM15_P142_S4	In addition, valuation allowances of approximately $3 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 related to foreign net operating losses.
352915_13_ITEM15_P142_S5	There were no significant increases in valuation allowances as a result of the acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation.
352915_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	We adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007.
352915_13_ITEM15_P143_S1	During 2012 and 2011, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased in the amount of approximately $1 million due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years.
352915_13_ITEM15_P143_S2	There was no significant increase in 2012 attributable to tax positions taken by Ascend Health Corporation on pre-acquisition tax return years.
352915_13_ITEM15_P143_S3	Also during 2012, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately $1 million.
352915_13_ITEM15_P143_S4	The balance at each of December 31, 2012 and 2011, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately $4 million and $5 million respectively.
352915_13_ITEM15_P143_S5	We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.
352915_13_ITEM15_P143_S6	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we have approximately $1 million of accrued interest and penalties.
352915_13_ITEM15_P143_S7	The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2009 and subsequent years.
352915_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years.
352915_13_ITEM15_P144_S1	The statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months.
352915_13_ITEM15_P144_S2	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months however it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.
352915_13_ITEM15_P144_S3	The tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows (amounts in thousands).
352915_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	7) LEASE COMMITMENTS Four of our hospital facilities are held under operating leases with Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms expiring in 2014 and 2016 (see Note 9 for additional disclosure).

352915_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	In accordance with Section 303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, we submitted our CEO s certification to the New York Stock Exchange in 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	Additionally, contained in Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are our CEO s and CFO s certifications regarding the quality of our public disclosures under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
352915_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our Mission Our mission and objective is to provide superior healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends, physicians prefer for their patients, purchasers select for their clients, employees are proud of, and investors seek for long-term results.
352915_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	To achieve this, we have a commitment to:
352915_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	innovation in service delivery Business Strategy We believe community-based hospitals will remain the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of self-determination for both the company and our hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	We selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	We are committed to a program of rational growth around our core businesses, while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve.
352915_14_ITEM1_P4_S3	Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P4_S4	We also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.
352915_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Improvement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.
352915_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	We also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.
352915_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	From time to time applications are filed with state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need, or CONs.
352915_14_ITEM1_P5_S4	Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.
352915_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible.
352915_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	We are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services.
352915_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures.
352915_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees, communities and our stockholders.
352915_14_ITEM1_P6_S4	In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	2013 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity: Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2013, we spent $13 million for the purchase of real property located in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.
352915_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	Divestitures: During 2013, we received $37 million in connection with the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services and certain other assets and real property including three previously closed behavioral health care facilities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	We agreed to sell Peak Behavioral Health Services as part of our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October of 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	The aggregate pre-tax gain on these divestitures did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	We believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility.
352915_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	Generally, we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians.
352915_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	Other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology.
352915_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors.
352915_14_ITEM1_P9_S5	We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate.
352915_14_ITEM1_P9_S6	In addition, hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_14_ITEM1_P9_S7	The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated.
352915_14_ITEM1_P9_S8	Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture.
352915_14_ITEM1_P9_S9	Information related to the behavioral health care facilities acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ), excluding 3 PSI facilities that were divested during 2011 pursuant to our agreement with the FTC, is included for the period of November 16, 2010 through December 31, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1_P9_S10	The licensed and available beds for those facilities are included in 2010 on a weighted average basis for the period owned.
352915_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	period of October 10, 2012 through December 31, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	The licensed and available beds for those facilities are included in 2012 on a weighted average basis for the period owned.
352915_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	(1) The statistical information for Auburn Regional Medical Center located in Washington (divested during the fourth quarter of 2012) is included in the above information through its respective divestiture date.
352915_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	(2) Average Available Beds is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available for patient care.
352915_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	(3) Patient Days is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.
352915_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	(4) Occupancy Rate is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of average beds, either available or licensed.
352915_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Sources of Revenue We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Sources of Revenue for additional disclosure.
352915_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Reporting.
352915_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected.
352915_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.
352915_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Licensing, Certification and Accreditation: All of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness.
352915_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments.
352915_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.
352915_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	All of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by The Joint Commission.
352915_14_ITEM1_P17_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P17_S5	If any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors.
352915_14_ITEM1_P17_S6	We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards.
352915_14_ITEM1_P17_S7	The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Certificates of Need: Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need ( CON ) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility s license, which could harm our business.
352915_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions.
352915_14_ITEM1_P20_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_14_ITEM1_P20_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Utilization Review: Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services.
352915_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group ( DRG ) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay.
352915_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program.
352915_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.
352915_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Audits: Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims.
352915_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights.
352915_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	The federal government contracts with third-party recovery audit contractors ( RACs ) and Medicaid integrity contractors ( MICs ), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers.
352915_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	The Recovery Audit Prepayment Review demonstration program will enable RACs to review claims before they are paid to ensure that the provider complied with all Medicare payment rules.
352915_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Currently, the demonstration program is targeting states with high populations of fraud- and error-prone providers.
352915_14_ITEM1_P26_S3	Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors ( ZPICs ) target claims for potential fraud and abuse.
352915_14_ITEM1_P26_S4	Additionally, Medicare administrative contractors ( MACs ) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers.
352915_14_ITEM1_P26_S5	The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) recently announced its intent to consolidate many of these Medicare and Medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors ( UPICs ), though it remains unclear what effect, if any, this proposed consolidation may have.
352915_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years, the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial.
352915_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
352915_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation The Stark Law:
352915_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met.
352915_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	These types of referrals are known as self-referrals.
352915_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to $15,000 for each violation, up to $100,000 for sham arrangements, up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs.
352915_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart.
352915_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	This recent regulation also places a number of compliance requirements on physician-owned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest.
352915_14_ITEM1_P31_S3	There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.
352915_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.
352915_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	However, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti-kickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law.
352915_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	The anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors, from the federal anti-kickback statute for various activities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services.
352915_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws.
352915_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	Similar State Laws: Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care.
352915_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure.
352915_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes.
352915_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
352915_14_ITEM1_P37_S4	These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_14_ITEM1_P37_S5	It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_14_ITEM1_P37_S6	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see Legal Proceedings ), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_14_ITEM1_P37_S7	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_14_ITEM1_P37_S8	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs.
352915_14_ITEM1_P37_S9	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations: A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the False Claims Act s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions.
352915_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.
352915_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	When a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim.
352915_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act.
352915_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government.
352915_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 ( FERA ) has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds.
352915_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	FERA also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments.
352915_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act.
352915_14_ITEM1_P42_S4	Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court.
352915_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Recent changes to the False Claims Act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified, or by the date any corresponding cost report was due, whichever is later.
352915_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	Failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil False Claims Act liability.
352915_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions: The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud.
352915_14_ITEM1_P43_S4	Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.
352915_14_ITEM1_P43_S5	Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs.
352915_14_ITEM1_P43_S6	HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare.
352915_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.
352915_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:
352915_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH ), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically.
352915_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry.
352915_14_ITEM1_P45_S2	HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information.
352915_14_ITEM1_P45_S3	The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed.
352915_14_ITEM1_P45_S4	Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.
352915_14_ITEM1_P45_S5	We believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of HIPAA, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance.
352915_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information.
352915_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements.
352915_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	HITECH has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred.
352915_14_ITEM1_P46_S3	We believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date.
352915_14_ITEM1_P46_S4	Recent changes to the HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers, including expanded obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.
352915_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft.
352915_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010, signed on December 18, 2010, appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the Red Flags Rule, but permits the FTC or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the Red Flags Rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft.
352915_14_ITEM1_P47_S2	Compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future.
352915_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005: On July 29, 2005, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 was enacted, which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety.
352915_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	This legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report Patient Safety Work Product ( PSWP ) to Patient Safety Organizations ( PSOs ).
352915_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	Under the system, PSWP is made privileged, confidential and legally protected from disclosure.
352915_14_ITEM1_P48_S3	PSWP does not include medical, discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety.
352915_14_ITEM1_P48_S4	This legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute PSWP.
352915_14_ITEM1_P48_S5	PSOs are certified by the Secretary of the HHS for three-year periods and analyze PSWP, provide feedback to providers and may report non-identifiable PSWP to a database.
352915_14_ITEM1_P48_S6	In addition, PSOs are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies.
352915_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs.
352915_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.
352915_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine: Several states, including Florida, Nevada, California and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services.
352915_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties.
352915_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable.
352915_14_ITEM1_P50_S3	These statutes and/or regulations vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.
352915_14_ITEM1_P50_S4	We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians.
352915_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.
352915_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	EMTALA: All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act ( EMTALA ).
352915_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	This federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition.
352915_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment.
352915_14_ITEM1_P52_S3	There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay.
352915_14_ITEM1_P52_S4	Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program.
352915_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.
352915_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions.
352915_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively.
352915_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	CMS has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments.
352915_14_ITEM1_P54_S3	The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future.
352915_14_ITEM1_P54_S4	We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.
352915_14_ITEM1_P54_S5	Health Care Industry Investigations: We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation.
352915_14_ITEM1_P54_S6	Legal Proceedings included herein for additional disclosure.
352915_14_ITEM1_P54_S7	In addition, currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_14_ITEM1_P54_S8	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.
352915_14_ITEM1_P55_S4	Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P55_S5	It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity.
352915_14_ITEM1_P55_S6	It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.
352915_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them.
352915_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.
352915_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	State Rate Review: Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state.
352915_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform: Medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level.
352915_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	All states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits.
352915_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits, and many states have established limits on attorney fees.
352915_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	Many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform.
352915_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform, and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates.
352915_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	Reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.
352915_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Compliance Program: Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998.
352915_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	Currently, the program s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program s policies.
352915_14_ITEM1_P61_S2	Since its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry s expectations and our needs.
352915_14_ITEM1_P61_S3	Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business.
352915_14_ITEM1_P61_S4	Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program.
352915_14_ITEM1_P61_S5	Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas.
352915_14_ITEM1_P61_S6	Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.
352915_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	Medical Staff and Employees Our facilities had approximately 66,100 employees on December 31, 2013, of whom approximately 47,000 were employed full-time.
352915_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	In a number of our markets, physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours.
352915_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	Within our acute care division, approximately 140 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P63_S3	Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time.
352915_14_ITEM1_P63_S4	In addition, within our behavioral health division, approximately 380 psychiatrists are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P63_S5	Each of our hospitals is managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of ours.
352915_14_ITEM1_P63_S6	In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital.
352915_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
352915_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	Approximately 1,600 of our employees at five of our hospitals are unionized.
352915_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	At Valley Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating Engineers and the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ).
352915_14_ITEM1_P64_S3	Nurses and technicians at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the SEIU and International Union of Operating Engineers.
352915_14_ITEM1_P64_S4	At The George Washington University Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the SEIU or the Hospital Police Association.
352915_14_ITEM1_P64_S5	Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain technicians and therapists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU.
352915_14_ITEM1_P64_S6	At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Teamsters and the Northwestern Nurses Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals.
352915_14_ITEM1_P64_S7	A union representation election was held at Corona Regional Medical Center ( Corona ) in January of 2013 for the nursing staff.
352915_14_ITEM1_P64_S8	A majority of those who cast ballots voted to be represented by the United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals (UNAC/UHCP).
352915_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	Corona timely filed objections to the election and an appeal.
352915_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	The results have not yet been certified.
352915_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	The National Labor Relations Board is currently reviewing the appeal.
352915_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	Competition The health care industry is highly competitive.
352915_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment.
352915_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes.
352915_14_ITEM1_P67_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_14_ITEM1_P67_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us.
352915_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.
352915_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in determining a hospital s success and competitive advantage.
352915_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_14_ITEM1_P69_S2	We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient s needs, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital s facilities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P69_S3	We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.
352915_14_ITEM1_P69_S4	In addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals.
352915_14_ITEM1_P69_S5	We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_14_ITEM1_P69_S6	Our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate.
352915_14_ITEM1_P69_S7	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_14_ITEM1_P69_S8	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	Many states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws.
352915_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states.
352915_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.
352915_14_ITEM1_P70_S3	Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges.
352915_14_ITEM1_P71_S2	In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients.
352915_14_ITEM1_P71_S3	Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience.
352915_14_ITEM1_P71_S4	The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.
352915_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	A key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets.
352915_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	The competition to acquire hospitals is significant.
352915_14_ITEM1_P72_S2	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P72_S3	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_14_ITEM1_P72_S4	We intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.
352915_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust: At December 31, 2013, we held approximately 6.1% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the Trust ).
352915_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
352915_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust.
352915_14_ITEM1_P73_S3	Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.
352915_14_ITEM1_P73_S4	We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $2.4 million during 2013, $2.1 million during 2012 and $2.0 million during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1_P73_S5	Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $842,000 during 2013, $1.2 million during 2012 and $4.6 million during 2011, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year.
352915_14_ITEM1_P73_S6	Included in our share of the Trust s income for 2012 and 2011 was approximately $500,000 in 2012 and $3.7 million in 2011 related to our share of the net favorable impact realized by the Trust in connection with: (i) gains on the sale of medical office buildings (in 2012 and 2011), and; (ii) gain on fair value recognition resulting from the Trust s purchase of minority ownership interests in majority owned limited liability companies partially offset by a provision for asset impairment (in 2011).
352915_14_ITEM1_P73_S7	The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $8.1 million and $9.3 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
352915_14_ITEM1_P73_S8	The market value of our investment in the Trust was $31.5 million at December 31, 2013 and $39.9 million at December 31, 2012, based on the closing price of the Trust s stock on the respective dates.
352915_14_ITEM1_P73_S9	Total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the Trust (as discussed below) was $16.4 million during 2013 and $16.3 million during each of 2012 and 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1_P73_S10	In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds either 100% of the ownership interest or various noncontrolling, majority ownership interests.
352915_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries.
352915_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms.
352915_14_ITEM1_P74_S2	Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below.
352915_14_ITEM1_P74_S3	The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year.
352915_14_ITEM1_P74_S4	The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.
352915_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term.
352915_14_ITEM1_P75_S1	In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.
352915_14_ITEM1_P75_S2	We also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at their appraised fair market value as well as purchase any or all of the four leased hospital properties at their appraised fair market value upon one month s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur.
352915_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	The table below details the remaining renewal options and terms for each of our four hospital facilities leased from the Trust:
352915_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	(a) We have three 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).
352915_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	The executive officers, whose terms will expire at such time as their successors are elected, are as follows:
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	Senior Vice President, President of Acute Care Division Mr. Alan B. Miller has been Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since inception and also served as President from inception until May, 2009.
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	Prior thereto, he was President, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of American Medicorp, Inc.
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S2	He currently serves as Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of Universal Health Realty Income Trust.
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S3	He is the father of Marc D. Miller, President and Director.
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S4	Mr. Marc D. Miller was elected President in May, 2009 and prior thereto served as Senior Vice President and co-head of our Acute Care Hospitals since 2007.
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S5	He was elected a Director in May, 2006 and Vice President in 2005.
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S6	He has served in various capacities related to our acute care division since 2000.
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S7	He was elected to the Board of Trustees of Universal Health Realty Income Trust in December, 2008.
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S8	He is the son of Alan B. Miller, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S9	Mr. Filton was elected Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in 2003 and he was elected Secretary in 1999.
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S10	He had served as Vice President and Controller since 1991 and Director of Corporate Accounting since 1985.

352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S13	Mr. Pember commenced employment with us in August, 2011 and serves as President of our Acute Care Division.
352915_14_ITEM1_P79_S14	He was formerly employed for 12 years at Indiana University Health, Inc. (formerly known as Clarian Health Partners, Inc.), a nonprofit hospital system that operates multiple facilities in Indiana, where he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such factors include, among other things, the following:
352915_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us, including matters as disclosed in Item 3.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	as discussed below in Sources of Revenue , we receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate, (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Illinois, Virginia and Massachusetts); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including Oklahoma, California and Arkansas, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	in March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Certain of our acute care hospitals implemented EHR applications in 2011 and 2012 and we continued the implementation at each of our acute care hospitals, on a facility-by-facility basis, until completion which occurred in June, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our acute care hospitals are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application, once they have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable stage or have completed attestations to their adoption or implementation of certified EHR technology.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	With the exception of the newly constructed Temecula Valley Hospital, which was opened in October, 2013, we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the stage 1, year one meaningful use criteria.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the Joint Committee ), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (approximately $35 million annual reduction to our Medicare net revenues effective as of April 1, 2013) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In addition, our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2013 includes approximately $46 million due from Texas in connection with Medicaid supplemental payment programs the majority of which we expect to collect during the second quarter of 2014.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois and Texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us (we have received $27 million of cash remittances from Illinois in January, 2014), no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois and/or Texas.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Given these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in Note 1 to the financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following: Revenue recognition: We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 38% of our net patient revenues during 2013, 39% during 2012 and 41% during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 49% of our net patient revenues during each of 2013 and 2012 and 47% during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P11_S9	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P11_S10	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2013, 2012 or 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of December 31, 2013, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care and Uninsured Discounts in Acute Care Hospital Services for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending our patient accounting system records net revenues for the services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patient s Medicaid eligibility.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Based on general factors as discussed below in Provision for Doubtful Accounts , our acute care facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Such estimated uncollectible amounts related to Medicaid pending, as well as other accounts receivable payer classifications, are considered when the overall individual facility and company-wide reserves are developed.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Adjustments related to the final determination of these accounts did not materially impact our results of operations in 2013, 2012 or 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S10	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S11	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S12	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S13	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S14	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P16_S15	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of a minimum of 30% of total charges.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $395 million and $311 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Approximately 90% during 2013 and 87% during 2012 of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our acute care hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of December 31, 2013 and 2012: As of December 31, 2013: As of December 31, 2012: Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P18_S8	The regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P18_S9	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P18_S10	We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Medicare EHR incentive payments: Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Medicaid EHR incentive payments: Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria were included in other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Self-Insured Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability: Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Prior to our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010, our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Prior to our acquisition in November, 2010, the PSI subsidiaries were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a $3 million self-insured retention to a limit of $75 million.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	PSI utilized its captive insurance company and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of PSI to manage the self-insured retention for all former PSI subsidiaries for claims incurred prior to January 1, 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	The captive insurance company also continues to insure all professional and general liability claims, regardless of date incurred, for the former PSI subsidiaries located in Florida and Puerto Rico.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Since our acquisition of PSI on November 15, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries (which are not former PSI subsidiaries) are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Effective November, 2010, our subsidiaries (including the former PSI subsidiaries) were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P22_S8	We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012 have general and professional liability policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to $20 million of aggregate coverage, subject to a $25,000 per occurrence deductible.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These facilities, like our other facilities, are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $206 million, of which $44 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $279 million, of which $48 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S5	We recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $81 million during 2013, $27 million during 2012 and $11 million during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S6	The favorable change in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2013, relating to years prior to 2013, were due primarily to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 100% from 75%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 0% from 25%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S7	As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S8	The favorable change recorded during 2012 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S9	The favorable change recorded during 2011 consisted primarily of third-party recoveries and reserve reductions in connection with PHICO related claims which we became liable for upon PHICO s (a former commercial insurance carrier) liquidation in 2002.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S10	As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $64 million, of which $34 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S11	As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $66 million, of which $35 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S12	The adjustments recorded during the last three years to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 or 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P24_S13	Although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for self-insured general and professional and workers compensation claims, given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves, as discussed above, it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and workers compensation reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2013 (amount in thousands):
352915_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	(a) General and professional liability amounts are net of adjustments recorded during each year, as discussed above.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In addition, we also maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The ultimate costs related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a $250,000 deductible for the majority of our properties (the properties acquired from Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. are subject to a $50,000 deductible).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented fault zones.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P27_S5	The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million, subject to a $25,000 deductible.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Non-critical flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Since certain of our facilities have been designated by our insurer as flood prone, we have elected to purchase policies from The National Flood Insurance Program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years, our catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P27_S9	There can be no assurance that a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We have designated September 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2013 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	There were also no impairments during 2012 or 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.

352915_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Charity Care and Uninsured Discounts: A significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in uninsured discounts amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:

352915_14_ITEM1A_P52_S4	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P52_S5	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.

352915_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self-pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P65_S4	The significant portion of our revenues derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in Texas and Nevada.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P65_S5	Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years (excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements) for: (i) our Acute Care and Behavioral Health Care Facilities Combined; (ii) our Acute Care Facilities, and; (iii) our Behavioral Health Care Facilities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P68_S2	The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s Medicare severity diagnosis related group ( MS-DRG ).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P68_S4	The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P68_S5	This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P68_S6	The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P68_S7	While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patient s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the hospital market basket index, gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P69_S3	In August, 2013, CMS published its final IPPS 2014 payment rule which provides for a 2.5% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	(covering the period of October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014) will approximate 1.0%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P70_S1	This projected impact from the IPPS 2014 final rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act ( ATRA ) of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P70_S2	The final rule would also expand CMS s policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Specifically, it would require Medicare s external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services for at least two midnights (the Two Midnight rule).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P70_S4	Correspondingly, under the final rule, CMS would presume that hospital services spanning less than two midnights should have been provided on an outpatient basis and paid under Medicare Part B unless the medical record contains clear documentation supporting the physician s order and an expectation that the Medicare beneficiary would need medically necessary care for more than two midnights, or is receiving services which CMS designates as inpatient only.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P70_S5	Our acute care hospitals have begun to comply with the Two Midnight rule and, although we are unable to determine the ultimate impact at this time, its application could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P70_S6	Excluding the potential impact of the Two Midnight rule, we do not expect the final IPPS 2014 payment rule to have a material impact on our future results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	In February, 2014, CMS extended a policy an additional six months where Recovery Auditor Contractors and other Medicare review contractors will not conduct post-payment patient status reviews of inpatient hospital claims with dates of admission on or after October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	In August, 2012, CMS published its final IPPS 2013 payment rule which provided for a 2.6% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2013 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013) approximated 1.8%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The impact from the IPPS 2013 final rule reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph, however, it excludes the impact of potential reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P73_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (approximately $35 million annual reduction to our Medicare net revenues effective as of April 1, 2013) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P73_S4	On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted which, among other things, includes a requirement for CMS to recoup $11 billion from hospitals from Medicare IPPS rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P73_S5	The recoupment relates to IPPS documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by CMS.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P73_S6	The 2014 IPPS final rule includes a -0.8% recoupment adjustment as the first step in this recovery process.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P73_S7	CMS expects to make similar adjustments in federal fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017 in order to recover the entire $11 billion.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P73_S8	This adjustment is reflected in the 2014 IPPS estimated impact amount noted above.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	On January 1, 2005, CMS implemented a new Psychiatric Prospective Payment System ( Psych PPS ) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	This system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P74_S2	The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	published its final Psych PPS rule for the fifteen month period July 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The market basket increase for this time period was 2.95%, which included a 0.25% reduction required by the federal Health Care Reform legislation enacted in 2010.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P75_S2	In August, 2012, CMS published its final Psych PPS rate notice for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P75_S3	That final notice contained a Psych PPS market basket update of 2.7%, which was reduced by 0.7% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and reduced by 0.1% to reflect an other adjustment required by the Social Security Act for rate years 2010 through 2019.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P75_S4	In July, 2013, CMS released its final Psych PPS rate notice for the federal fiscal year 2014.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P75_S5	The final notice contains a Psych PPS market basket update of 2.6% which is reduced by 0.5% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and reduced by 0.1% to reflect an other adjustment required by the Social Security Act.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	In December, 2013, CMS published its annual final Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System ( OPPS ) rule for 2014.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P76_S1	The final hospital market basket increase is 2.5%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P76_S2	The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.3% reduction to the 2014 OPPS market basket reducing the final 2014 OPPS market basket update to 1.7%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P76_S3	In the final rule, CMS reduced the 2014 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P76_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS for 2014 will aggregate to a net increase of 1.4%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P76_S5	Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2014 is estimated to be 2.5%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	In November, 2012, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.6%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2013 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 0.7%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P77_S3	In the final rule, CMS is also implementing a significant increase in the 2013 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P77_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2013 is estimated to be 3.5%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P77_S5	Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2013 was approximately 1.7%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In November, 2011, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	The market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 3.0%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P78_S2	In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2012 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 1.1%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P78_S3	In the final rule, CMS also implemented a significant decrease in the 2012 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P78_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS payment decrease for 2012 was estimated to be approximately 0.7%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P78_S5	Excluding the behavioral health partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2012 was approximately 2.1%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P78_S6	We entered into an agreement in April, 2012 with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and CMS (referred to collectively as HHS ) that resulted in an aggregate cash payment to us of approximately $36 million which was received during 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P78_S7	After reductions for estimated related expenses and the portion attributable to third-party non-controlling ownership interests, this settlement favorably impacted our 2012 pre-tax consolidated financial results by approximately $30 million (recording during the first quarter of 2012).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P78_S8	This agreement was part of an industry-wide settlement with HHS related to litigation that was pending for several years contending that acute care hospitals in the U.S. were underpaid from the Medicare inpatient prospective payment system during a number of prior years.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P78_S9	The underpayments resulted from calculations related to rural floor budget neutrality adjustments that were implemented in connection with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P79_S3	In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P79_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P79_S5	We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Illinois, Virginia and Massachusetts, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs (which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective 2013 state fiscal years) as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P79_S6	Based upon the state budgets for the 2013 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2012), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates were reduced by approximately 1% (or approximately $15 million annually) from the average rates in effect during the states 2012 fiscal years (which generally ended during the third quarter of 2012).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P79_S7	Based upon the state budgets for the 2014 fiscal year (which will generally began at various times during the second half of 2013), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates will remain relatively unchanged from the 2013 fiscal year rates.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The Affordable Care Act substantially increases the federally and state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	However, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of the Affordable Care Act requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that states in which we operate will expand Medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments, as discussed below.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P80_S4	We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hidalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in CMS-approved private Medicaid supplemental payment ( UPL ) programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Our hospitals receive both UPL payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P81_S3	The UPL payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer ( IGT ) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P81_S4	We recorded net UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of $61 million during 2013, $25 million during 2012 and $31 million during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P81_S5	If the applicable hospital district or county makes IGTs consistent with 2013 levels, and without giving effect to potential reductions resulting from the February, 2013 THHSC proposed rule, which is discussed below, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net revenues earned pursuant to these programs of approximately $54 million during the state fiscal year state 2014 which ends on September 30, 2014.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	For state fiscal year 2014, Texas Medicaid will continue to operate under a CMS-approved Section 1115 five-year Medicaid waiver demonstration program.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	During the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission ( THHSC ) transitioned away from UPL payments to new waiver incentive payment programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P82_S2	During the first year of transition, which commenced on October 1, 2011, THHSC made payments to Medicaid UPL recipient providers that received payments during the state s prior fiscal year.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P82_S3	During transition years two through five, THHSC will make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	statewide caps based on CMS approved Medicaid waiver amounts.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P83_S1	In February, 2013, THHSC proposed a rule that indicates that any required statewide UPL payment reductions will be applied a pro rata basis to all UPL payment recipients.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Although our future UPL payments in Texas may be adversely impacted by this proposed rule, we are unable to estimate the potential impact on us since the amount of the statewide pro rata UPL payment reduction, if any, has not yet been determined by THHSC.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We incur health-care related taxes ( Provider Taxes ) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items of services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching dollars as part of their respective state Medicaid programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Including the impact of the California, Oklahoma, Indiana and Ohio programs that were initiated during 2013 or 2012, as mentioned below, we earned an aggregate net benefit of approximately $69 million during 2013, $58 million during 2012 (of which $12 million related to 2011) and $26 million during 2011 from Medicaid supplemental payments, after assessed Provider Taxes were considered.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P85_S2	We estimate that our aggregate net benefit from Provider Tax programs will approximate $46 million during 2014.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P85_S3	The aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P85_S4	However, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	In California, a Medicaid state plan amendment ( SPA ) was submitted to CMS by the state requesting and extension of a prior provider tax and related Medicaid supplemental payment program retroactive to July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	In June, 2012, CMS approved a portion of the SPA which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during 2013 or 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P86_S2	In June, 2013, CMS approved the Medicaid managed care component of the SPA covering the period of July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P86_S3	The net aggregate benefit for the period of July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2013 was $11 million (of which $8 million was applicable to prior years) which was included in our financial results during the second quarter of 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P86_S4	The SPA noted above covering the six month period July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 is still subject to CMS approval.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P86_S5	Similarly, in October, 2013 the state of California enacted new legislation (SB 239) that would continue the provider tax and related Medicaid supplemental payment program for three years effective January 1, 2014 and likewise is subject to CMS approval.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P86_S6	As such, if these CMS approvals are obtained by the state, the program impact will be retroactive to July 1, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P86_S7	Although we cannot predict whether or not CMS will ultimately approve these additional programs (covering the period of July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2016), if approved by CMS, we estimate the average pre-tax favorable impact on our results of operations to be approximately $10 million annually.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	In January, 2012, the state of Oklahoma was granted federal approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) for the Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program ( SHOPP ) which grants the Oklahoma Health Care Authority the authority to assess a 2.5% fee on certain Oklahoma hospitals and to make Medicaid supplemental payments to hospitals through December 31, 2014, retroactive to July 1, 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P87_S1	The state finalized the initial supplemental payment program amounts in March, 2012 and our 2012 pre-tax consolidated financial results were favorably impacted by approximately $21 million in connection with the SHOPP program covering the period of July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	During the second quarter of 2012, new supplemental Medicaid programs were initiated in Indiana and Ohio in which we operate behavioral health care facilities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Our 2012 pre-tax consolidated financial results were favorably impacted by approximately $14 million recorded in connection with these programs which were retroactive to July, 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	State Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital ( DSH ) adjustment.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P89_S3	Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas and South Carolina s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state s DSH fund.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P89_S4	The South Carolina and Texas DSH programs were renewed for each state s 2014 DSH fiscal year (covering the period of October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P89_S5	In September, 2013, the THHSC published its 2013 final DSH rule that included changes that resulted in approximately $9 million of additional reimbursements to our acute care facilities located in Texas applicable to the state s 2013 fiscal year (which were included in our 2013 pre-tax consolidated financial results).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P89_S6	In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $54 million during 2013, $47 million during 2012 and $45 million during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P89_S7	Assuming that the Texas and South Carolina programs are renewed for each state s 2015 fiscal years, at amounts similar to the 2014 fiscal year estimates, we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be approximately $49 million during 2014.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P89_S8	Failure to renew these DSH programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive DSH payments to qualify for future DSH funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements (see below), could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The Affordable Care Act provides for a significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in 2016 (see below in Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid Revisions for additional disclosure).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P91_S1	As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in Texas and South Carolina, will likely be reduced in the coming years.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Based on the September, 2013 CMS final rule, our Medicaid DSH payments in Texas and South Carolina could be reduced by approximately 4% in the 2016 federal fiscal year.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P91_S3	This statutorily required reduction was originally scheduled to be implemented in federal fiscal year 2014 but was delayed to FFY 2016 by the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	In May, 2013 the state of Texas enacted legislation that would increase the state s contribution of the non-federal DSH share for the 2013 DSH year to $138 million as compared to the $100 million previously expected.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Similarly, the state s approved 2014-2015 General Appropriations bill passed in May, 2013 authorized $160 million for 2014 and $140 million for 2015, respectively, for the non-federal DSH share.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P92_S2	We expect the 2014 and 2015 DSH year amounts to be comparable to the 2013 DSH year amounts.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	HITECH Act: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P93_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P94_S1	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P94_S2	State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but we expect that all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate will ultimately choose to participate.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P94_S3	Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	The government s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	During 2011, we began implementing EHR applications at certain of our acute care hospitals and continued to do so, on a hospital-by-hospital basis, until completion which occurred at the end of June, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Our acute care hospitals are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application, once they have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable stage or have completed attestations to their adoption or implementation of certified EHR technology.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P96_S2	With the exception of the newly constructed and recently opened Temecula Valley Hospital, we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the stage 1, year one meaningful use criteria.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P96_S3	Our 2013 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pre-tax impact of approximately $19 million consisting of approximately $61 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $10 million of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses, approximately $33 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P96_S4	Our 2012 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pre-tax impact of approximately $3 million consisting of approximately $30 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $15 million of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses, approximately $13 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P97_S3	Although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the EHR standards by 2015, there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the HITECH Act.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P98_S2	The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P99_S3	Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P99_S4	To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:
352915_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P102_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, the War on Terrorism, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, the expansion of a Medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the Reconciliation Act ) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the Affordable Care Act ), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The Affordable Care Act implemented certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	A Medicare shared savings program, effective in 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	A hospital readmissions reduction program, effective in 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	A value-based purchasing program for hospitals, effective in 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P109_S0	A national pilot program on payment bundling, effective in 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Reduction to Medicare disproportionate share hospital ( DSH ) payments, effective in 2014, as discussed above.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments, effective in 2014.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P112_S0	The Affordable Care Act (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal DSH funding from federal fiscal year ( FFY ) 2016 through FFY 2023.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P112_S1	The aggregate annual reduction amounts are:
352915_14_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Large employer insurance reforms, effective in 2015.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies, effective in 2014.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms, effective in 2010 and forward.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P115_S1	The Affordable Care Act will seek to increase competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state insurance exchanges starting in 2014.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P115_S2	The Affordable Care Act also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health status, gender, or other specified factors.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P115_S3	We cannot provide assurance that these provisions will not adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for services provided to insured patients, or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Value-Based Purchasing: There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P116_S1	These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P117_S1	In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P117_S2	Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P118_S0	The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P119_S0	The Affordable Care Act prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions ( HAC ).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P119_S1	Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P119_S2	Hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P119_S3	The Affordable Care Act also required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P119_S4	The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in FFY 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P119_S5	HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P119_S6	HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P119_S7	In its fiscal year 2014 IPPS final rule, CMS will fund the 2014 value-based purchasing program by reducing base operating DRG payment amounts to participating hospitals by 1.25%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P120_S0	In the Affordable Care Act, Congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program ( HRRP ).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P120_S1	The HRRP assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates when compared to expected rates, effective for discharges beginning October 1, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P121_S0	CMS finalized certain policies with regard to payment under the HRRP, including which hospitals are subject to the HRRP, the methodology to calculate the hospital readmission payment adjustment factor, and what portion of the IPPS payment is used to calculate the readmission adjustment factor.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P121_S1	In the fiscal year 2014 IPPS final rule, CMS finalized revisions to the three 30-day admission measures in the program heart failure, myocardial infarction, and pneumonia to exclude planned readmissions.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P121_S2	Under the Affordable Care Act, beginning in fiscal year 2015, CMS will expand the program and add two readmission measures, one, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and, two, patients admitted for elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P122_S0	We do not believe impact of HRRP for federal fiscal years 2013 and 2014 had or will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P123_S0	The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations ( ACOs ).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P123_S1	The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P123_S2	The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P123_S3	ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P124_S0	In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P124_S1	The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P124_S2	We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P124_S3	Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P124_S4	Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P124_S5	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P124_S6	Other Operating Results Combined net revenues and income/losses before income taxes from our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2013, 2012 or 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Interest Expense Below is a schedule of our interest expense during 2013, 2012 and 2011 (amounts in thousands):
352915_14_ITEM1A_P126_S0	During September, 2012, we completed a second amendment to our credit agreement dated November, 15, 2010, as amended.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P126_S1	The second amendment provided for a new $900 million Term Loan A-2 with a final maturity date of August 15, 2016.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P126_S2	This amendment also extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility and the existing Term Loan A by nine months to also mature on August 15, 2016.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P126_S3	We used $700 million of the Term Loan A-2 proceeds to repay our higher priced Term Loan B facility.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P126_S4	The remainder of the new Term Loan A-2 proceeds was used to pay transaction-related fees and expenses and to repay other floating rate debt.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P127_S0	During May, 2013 we completed a third amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P127_S1	The third amendment provides for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with certain borrowings under the credit agreement.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P127_S2	Specifically, we replaced our existing $745.9 million senior secured Tranche B term loan with a new senior secured Tranche B-1 term loan in the same amount on substantially the same terms as the Tranche B term loan, other than lower interest rates.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P127_S3	Borrowings under the Tranche B-1 term loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, of one, two, three or six month LIBOR, plus an applicable margin of 2.25% or ABR plus an applicable margin of 1.25%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P127_S4	The minimum LIBOR and ABR rates for the Tranche B term loan of 1.0% and 2.0%, respectively, were eliminated.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P127_S5	Interest expense decreased $33 million during 2013 to $146 million as compared to $179 million during 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P127_S6	The decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $21 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit and demand notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program due primarily to a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities, as discussed below; (ii) a $5 million decrease in the amortization of financing fees, and; (iii) other combined net decrease of $7 million consisting primarily of interest earned by us on delayed cash remittances paid to us from Illinois.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P127_S7	The aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement (consisting of the revolving credit, Term Loan A, Term Loan B/B-1 and Term Loan A2 facilities), demand notes and accounts receivable securitization program were $2.9 billion during each of 2013 and 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P127_S8	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 2.2% during 2013 and 2.9% during 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P128_S0	these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 3.6% during 2013 and 4.5% during 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P128_S1	Interest expense decreased $22 million during 2012 to $179 million as compared to $201 million during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P128_S2	The decreased interest expense during 2012 was due primarily to: (i) a $29 million decrease in interest expense due primarily to a decrease in our average effective borrowing rate (due in part to the repayment of the $200 million, 6.75% Senior Notes in November, 2011, utilizing borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit agreement which are borrowed at a lower interest rate and, as mentioned above in (a.)), the extinguishment (during the third quarter of 2012) of $700 million of borrowings pursuant to our Term Loan B with proceeds from the new Term Loan A2 which are borrowed at a lower interest rate; (ii) a $5 million decrease in interest expense due to an increase in interest being capitalized on major construction projects, partially offset by; (iii) a $12 million increase in interest expense due to an increase in our net interest rate swap expense.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P128_S3	The aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement (consisting of the revolving credit, Term Loan A, Term Loan B and Term Loan A2 facilities), demand notes and accounts receivable securitization program were $2.9 billion during each of 2012 and 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P128_S4	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 4.5% during 2012 and 4.6% during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P128_S5	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 2.9% during 2012 and 3.4% during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Transaction Costs During 2012, we incurred approximately $6 million of transaction costs in connection with our acquisition of 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P129_S1	These costs consisted primarily of legal, investment banking and consulting fees.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P129_S2	There were no material transaction fees incurred in 2013 or 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_14_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Outside owners hold various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in seven of our acute care facilities and one behavioral health care facility.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P131_S1	Each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies ( LLC ) or limited partnerships ( LP ).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P131_S2	As a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P131_S3	When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members /partners share of the income generated by the joint-venture entities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P132_S0	In addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P133_S0	The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_14_ITEM1A_P134_S0	The impact of the discrete tax items did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes during 2013, 2012 or 2011.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Discontinued Operations In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services ( Peak ), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P135_S1	The divestiture of Peak was completed during the second quarter of 2013 for total cash proceeds of approximately $24 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million which is included in our 2013 consolidated financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P136_S0	In October of 2012, we completed the divestiture of Auburn Regional Medical Center ( Auburn ), a 159-bed acute care hospital located in Auburn, Washington, for total cash proceeds of approximately $93 million.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P136_S1	This divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $26 million which was included in our 2012 consolidated financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P136_S2	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities as well as one of our legacy behavioral health facilities in Puerto Rico.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P136_S3	Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we divested:
352915_14_ITEM1A_P137_S0	in January, 2012, the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, a 108-bed facility located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P138_S0	The operating results for Auburn, Peak and the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership during each of the years presented herein.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P138_S1	Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P138_S2	Assets and liabilities for Peak were reflected as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P139_S0	The following table shows the results of operations for Auburn and Peak and the former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada, on a combined basis, which were reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership for each of the years presented herein (amounts in thousands):
352915_14_ITEM1A_P140_S0	Effects of Inflation and Seasonality Seasonality Our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P140_S1	This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P141_S0	Inflation Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P141_S1	However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P141_S2	Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P141_S3	We believe, however, that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P142_S0	Liquidity Year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to December 31, 2012:
352915_14_ITEM1A_P142_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $884 million during 2013 and $799 million during 2012.

352915_14_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Days sales outstanding ( DSO ): Our DSO are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the year.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P144_S1	The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance the end of the year.

352915_14_ITEM1A_P162_S0	The Third Amendment provides for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with certain borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P162_S1	Upon the effectiveness of the Third Amendment, UHS replaced its existing $745.9 million senior secured Tranche B term loan with a new senior secured Tranche B-1 term loan in the same amount on substantially the same terms as the Tranche B term loan, other than lower interest rates.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P163_S0	Borrowings under the Tranche B-1 term loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, one, two, three or six month LIBOR, plus an applicable margin of 2.25% or ABR plus an applicable margin of 1.25%.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P163_S1	The minimum LIBOR and ABR rates for the Tranche B term loan of 1.0% and 2.0%, respectively, were eliminated.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P164_S0	In September, 2012, we entered into a second amendment ( Second Amendment ) to our Credit Agreement which provided for: (i) a new $900 million Term Loan-A ( Term Loan A2 ) at the same interest rates as our existing Term Loan A and a final maturity date of August 15, 2016; (ii) the extension of the maturity date on a substantial portion of our $800 million revolving credit facility commitment with $777 million of the commitment extended to mature on August 15, 2016 and the remaining $23 million commitment scheduled to mature on November 15, 2015 (there were no borrowings outstanding pursuant to our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2013), and; (iii) the extension of the maturity date on a substantial portion of our Term Loan-A borrowings which, based upon the outstanding Term Loan-A borrowings as of December 31, 2013, $892 million is scheduled to mature on August 15, 2016 and the remaining $43 million is scheduled to mature on November 15, 2015.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P164_S1	The Second Amendment also provides for increased flexibility for refinancing and certain other modifications but substantially all other terms of the Credit Agreement remain unchanged.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P165_S0	In September, 2012, we used $700 million of the proceeds from the new Term Loan A2 facility to extinguish a portion of our higher priced, Term Loan-B facility.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P165_S1	Pricing under the new Term Loan A2 facility was 1% lower than the Term Loan-B facility and did not include a LIBOR Floor whereas, at that time, the Term Loan-B facility had a 1% LIBOR Floor (which has since been eliminated as part of the above-mentioned Third Amendment in May, 2013).
352915_14_ITEM1A_P166_S0	During the third quarter of 2012, in connection with the extinguishment of a portion of our Term Loan-B facility, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $29 million to write-off the related portion of the Term Loan-B deferred financing costs.

352915_14_ITEM1A_P167_S1	The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P167_S2	The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P167_S3	Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the lender s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 borrowings and 1.25% for Term Loan B borrowings or (2) the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 borrowings and 2.25% for Term Loan-B borrowings.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P167_S4	The current applicable margins are 0.50% for ABR-based loans, 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities and 2.25% under the Term Loan-B facility.

352915_14_ITEM1A_P168_S1	During 2013, we made scheduled principal payments of $72 million on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan A2 facilities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P168_S2	Quarterly installment payments ( Installment Payments ) are due on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities which approximate $72 million in 2014, $77 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2016.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P168_S3	The Installment Payments due on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities during 2014 are classified as current maturities of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2013.

352915_14_ITEM1A_P169_S0	Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals ( Receivables ) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P169_S1	We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P169_S2	We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P169_S3	The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P169_S4	The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P169_S5	The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P169_S6	At December 31, 2013, we had $240 million of outstanding borrowings and $35 million of additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.

352915_14_ITEM1A_P170_S5	These Unsecured Notes are guaranteed by a group of subsidiaries (each of which is a 100% directly or indirectly owned subsidiary of Universal Health Services, Inc.) which fully and unconditionally guarantee the Unsecured Notes on a joint and several basis, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P170_S6	On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the 7.125% Notes ).

352915_14_ITEM1A_P174_S1	We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P174_S2	Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) the issuance of equity; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement, and/or; (iii) the issuance of other long-term debt.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P175_S0	revolving credit facility and access to the capital markets provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P175_S1	However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P175_S2	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P175_S3	As of December 31, 2013 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $85 million consisting of: (i) $69 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $16 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P175_S4	Obligations under operating leases for real property, real property master leases and equipment amount to $307 million as of December 31, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P176_S0	The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P176_S1	We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P176_S2	In addition, we lease four hospital facilities from the Trust with terms expiring in 2014 and 2016.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P176_S3	These leases contain up to three 5-year renewal options.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P176_S4	We also lease the real property of certain facilities acquired by us in connection with the acquisition of PSI in November, 2010 and Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P176_S5	The following represents the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013:
352915_14_ITEM1A_P177_S0	(a) Reflects borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2013 as discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P178_S0	(b) Assumes that all debt outstanding as of December 31, 2013, including borrowings under our Credit Agreement, demand note and accounts receivable securitization program, remain outstanding until the final maturity of the debt agreements at the same interest rates (some of which are floating) which were in effect as of December 31, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P179_S0	We have the right to repay borrowings upon short notice and without penalty, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, demand note and accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P179_S1	Also includes the impact of various interest rate swap and cap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2013, as calculated to maturity dates utilizing the applicable floating interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P180_S0	(c) Estimated construction cost of a newly constructed acute care hospital located in Henderson, Nevada.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P180_S1	We are required to build this hospital, on which construction has not yet begun, pursuant to an agreement with a third party.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P180_S2	In addition to this new hospital project, we had various other projects under construction as of December 31, 2013 with estimated additional cost to complete and equip of approximately $155 million.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P180_S3	Because we can terminate substantially all of the related construction contracts at any time without paying a termination fee, these costs are excluded from the above table except for the amount contractually committed to a third-party.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P181_S0	(d) Consists of: (i) $76 million related to long-term contracts with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing services for our acute care facilities; (ii) $149 million related to the future expected costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the on-going operation of an electronic health records application ( EHR ) for each of our acute care facilities (please see Item 7-Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Medicare for additional disclosure); (iii) $33 million purchase commitment expected to be incurred in 2014 related to certain equipment for our acute care hospitals, and; (iv) a $3 million liability for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P182_S0	(e) Reflects our future minimum operating lease payment obligations related to our operating lease agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2013 as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P182_S1	Some of the lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease and our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P183_S0	(f) Consists of $205 million of estimated future payments related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan (estimated through 2088), as disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , and $17 million of estimated future payments related to another retirement plan liability.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P183_S1	Included in our other assets as of December 31, 2013 was a $3 million asset recorded in connection with the non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan and included in other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2013 was a $13 million liability recorded in connection with the other retirement plan.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P183_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $206 million, of which $44 million is included in other current liabilities and $162 million is included in other non-current liabilities.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P183_S3	We exclude the $206 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P183_S4	Please see Self-Insured Risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P184_S0	In connection with five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain put rights , that are currently exercisable, that if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member s interests at fair market value.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P184_S1	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P185_S0	In connection with a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the PSI acquisition, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P185_S1	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P185_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities, pursuant to the terms of the put options, approximates the $218 million aggregate book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P185_S3	We exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these minority ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertainty as to: (i) whether or not the put rights will actually be exercised; (ii) the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were exercised, and; (iii) the timing of such payments.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P185_S4	Additionally, the table above does not include $3 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM1A_P186_S0	Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be utilized.
352915_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as of December 31, 2013, are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	We incurred no additional capital lease obligations during 2013, 2012 or 2011.
352915_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	In the ordinary course of business, our facilities routinely lease equipment pursuant to new lease arrangements that will likely result in future lease and rental expense in excess of amounts indicated above.
352915_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Professional and General Liability, Workers Compensation Liability and Property Insurance Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability: Effective January 1, 2008, most of our subsidiaries became self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence.
352915_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Prior to our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010, our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of $10 million up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	However, we are liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	Prior to our acquisition in November, 2010, the PSI subsidiaries were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a $3 million self-insured retention to a limit of $75 million.
352915_14_ITEM2_P1_S3	PSI utilized its captive insurance company and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of PSI to manage the self-insured retention for all former PSI subsidiaries for claims incurred prior to January 1, 2011.
352915_14_ITEM2_P1_S4	The captive insurance company also continues to insure all professional and general liability claims, regardless of date incurred, for the former PSI subsidiaries located in Florida and Puerto Rico.
352915_14_ITEM2_P1_S5	Since our acquisition of PSI on November 15, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries (which are not former PSI subsidiaries) are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million per occurrence.
352915_14_ITEM2_P1_S6	Effective November, 2010, our subsidiaries (including the former PSI subsidiaries) were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_14_ITEM2_P1_S7	We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	aggregate coverage, subject to a $25,000 per occurrence deductible.
352915_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	These facilities, like our other facilities, are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S1	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S2	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S3	As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $206 million, of which $44 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S4	As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $279 million, of which $48 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S5	We recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $81 million during 2013, $27 million during 2012 and $11 million during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S6	The favorable change in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2013, relating to years prior to 2013, were due primarily to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 100% from 75%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 0% from 25%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S7	As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S8	The favorable change recorded during 2012 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S9	The favorable change recorded during 2011 consisted primarily of third-party recoveries and reserve reductions in connection with PHICO related claims which we became liable for upon PHICO s (a former commercial insurance carrier) liquidation in 2002.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S10	As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $64 million, of which $34 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S11	As of December 31, 2012, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $66 million, of which $35 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_14_ITEM2_P3_S12	The adjustments recorded during the last three years to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 or 2011.
352915_14_ITEM2_P4_S0	We have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a $250,000 deductible for the majority of our properties (the properties acquired from Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. are subject to a $50,000 deductible).
352915_14_ITEM2_P4_S1	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_14_ITEM2_P5_S0	from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_14_ITEM2_P5_S1	Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented fault zones.
352915_14_ITEM2_P5_S2	Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_14_ITEM2_P5_S3	The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million, subject to a $25,000 deductible.
352915_14_ITEM2_P5_S4	Non-critical flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.
352915_14_ITEM2_P5_S5	Since certain of our facilities have been designated by our insurer as flood prone, we have elected to purchase policies from The National Flood Insurance Program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible.
352915_14_ITEM2_P5_S6	Legal Proceedings We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to litigation, as outlined below.
352915_14_ITEM2_P6_S0	In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICDs ) from 2003 to 2010 at several of our acute care facilities.
352915_14_ITEM2_P6_S1	The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Coverage Determination regarding these devices.
352915_14_ITEM2_P6_S2	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM2_P7_S0	In July, 2012, one of our subsidiaries, Peachford Behavioral Health System of Atlanta located in Atlanta, Georgia, received a subpoena from the OIG for the Department of Health and Human Services requesting various documents.
352915_14_ITEM2_P7_S1	We have provided all requested documents.
352915_14_ITEM2_P7_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2013, we were notified that the governmental agencies investigating this matter had declined to proceed.
352915_14_ITEM2_P8_S0	In February, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and several UHS owned facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a, The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_14_ITEM2_P8_S1	The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_14_ITEM2_P8_S2	Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM2_P9_S0	In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various documents from January, 2005 to the present.
352915_14_ITEM2_P9_S1	In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_14_ITEM2_P9_S2	In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records.
352915_14_ITEM2_P9_S3	We have been advised by the DOJ s Criminal Frauds Section that they have received a referral from the DOJ Civil Division and have opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center.
352915_14_ITEM2_P9_S4	In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section has been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy.
352915_14_ITEM2_P9_S5	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigations, liability of the facilities and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with these matters.
352915_14_ITEM2_P10_S0	The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010: Garden City Employees Retirement System v. PSI: This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws.
352915_14_ITEM2_P10_S1	We intend to defend the case vigorously.
352915_14_ITEM2_P10_S2	Should we be deemed liable in this matter, we believe we would be entitled to commercial insurance recoveries for amounts paid by us, subject to certain limitations and deductibles.
352915_14_ITEM2_P10_S3	Included in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, is an estimated reserve (current liability) and corresponding commercial insurance recovery (current asset) which did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM2_P10_S4	Although we believe the commercial insurance recoveries are adequate to satisfy potential liability and related legal fees in connection with this matter, we can provide no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the commercial insurance recoveries which would make us liable for the excess.
352915_14_ITEM2_P11_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_14_ITEM2_P12_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_14_ITEM2_P12_S1	The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_14_ITEM2_P12_S2	Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July 2011 requesting additional documents, which have been collected and delivered to the DOJ.
352915_14_ITEM2_P13_S0	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_14_ITEM2_P14_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_14_ITEM2_P14_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_14_ITEM2_P14_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ.
352915_14_ITEM2_P14_S3	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_14_ITEM2_P15_S0	Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims: The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services ( DMAS ) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state s Medicaid Provider Services Manual ( Manual ).
352915_14_ITEM2_P15_S1	As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities.
352915_14_ITEM2_P15_S2	PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending.
352915_14_ITEM2_P15_S3	We had previously agreed to a settlement of this matter which was approved by Virginia state officials during the first quarter of 2014.
352915_14_ITEM2_P15_S4	The aggregate refund of Medicaid payments made to those facilities, as requested by DMAS, and the settlement amount is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM2_P16_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse.
352915_14_ITEM2_P17_S0	action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
352915_14_ITEM2_P17_S1	Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_14_ITEM2_P17_S2	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_14_ITEM2_P18_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_14_ITEM2_P18_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_14_ITEM2_P18_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein.
352915_14_ITEM2_P18_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_14_ITEM2_P18_S4	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_14_ITEM2_P18_S5	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_14_ITEM2_P18_S6	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_14_ITEM2_P18_S7	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.

352915_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICDs ) from 2003 to 2010 at several of our acute care facilities.
352915_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Coverage Determination regarding these devices.
352915_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	We have provided all requested documents.
352915_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2013, we were notified that the governmental agencies investigating this matter had declined to proceed.
352915_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	In February, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and several UHS owned facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a, The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_14_ITEM3_P2_S2	Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various documents from January, 2005 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_14_ITEM3_P3_S1	In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_14_ITEM3_P3_S2	In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records.
352915_14_ITEM3_P3_S3	We have been advised by the DOJ s Criminal Frauds Section that they have received a referral from the DOJ Civil Division and have opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center.
352915_14_ITEM3_P3_S4	In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section has been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy.
352915_14_ITEM3_P3_S5	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigations, liability of the facilities and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with these matters.
352915_14_ITEM3_P4_S0	The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc.) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010: Garden City Employees Retirement System v. PSI: This is a purported shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against PSI and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws.
352915_14_ITEM3_P4_S1	We intend to defend the case vigorously.
352915_14_ITEM3_P4_S2	Should we be deemed liable in this matter, we believe we would be entitled to commercial insurance recoveries for amounts paid by us, subject to certain limitations and deductibles.
352915_14_ITEM3_P4_S3	Included in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, is an estimated reserve (current liability) and corresponding commercial insurance recovery (current asset) which did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM3_P4_S4	Although we believe the commercial insurance recoveries are adequate to satisfy potential liability and related legal fees in connection with this matter, we can provide no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the commercial insurance recoveries which would make us liable for the excess.
352915_14_ITEM3_P5_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_14_ITEM3_P6_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_14_ITEM3_P6_S1	The requested documents have been collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_14_ITEM3_P6_S2	Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July 2011 requesting additional documents, which have been collected and delivered to the DOJ.
352915_14_ITEM3_P7_S0	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_14_ITEM3_P8_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_14_ITEM3_P8_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_14_ITEM3_P8_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ.
352915_14_ITEM3_P8_S3	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_14_ITEM3_P9_S0	Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services Recoupment Claims: The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services ( DMAS ) has conducted audits at seven former PSI Residential Treatment Centers operated in the Commonwealth of Virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the state s Medicaid Provider Services Manual ( Manual ).
352915_14_ITEM3_P9_S1	As a result of those audits, DMAS claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the Manual and has requested repayment of Medicaid payments to those facilities.
352915_14_ITEM3_P9_S2	PSI had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending.
352915_14_ITEM3_P9_S3	We had previously agreed to a settlement of this matter which was approved by Virginia state officials during the first quarter of 2014.
352915_14_ITEM3_P9_S4	The aggregate refund of Medicaid payments made to those facilities, as requested by DMAS, and the settlement amount is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM3_P10_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse.
352915_14_ITEM3_P10_S1	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
352915_14_ITEM3_P10_S2	Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_14_ITEM3_P10_S3	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_14_ITEM3_P11_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_14_ITEM3_P11_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_14_ITEM3_P11_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein.
352915_14_ITEM3_P11_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_14_ITEM3_P11_S4	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_14_ITEM3_P11_S5	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_14_ITEM3_P11_S6	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_14_ITEM3_P11_S7	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.
352915_14_ITEM3_P12_S0	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_14_ITEM3_P12_S1	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

352915_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers.
352915_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	As of February 27, 2014, we owned and/or operated 24 acute care hospitals and 193 behavioral health centers located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	As part of our ambulatory treatment centers division, we manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 5 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 4 states.
352915_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	In October, 2012, we acquired Ascend Health Corporation ( Ascend ).
352915_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	Ascend was the largest private behavioral health provider with 9 owned or leased freestanding inpatient facilities located in 5 states.
352915_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	No. 2011-07, Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities, which required certain health care entities to change the presentation in their statement of operations by reclassifying the provision for bad debts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts).
352915_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	As a result, the provision for doubtful accounts for our acute care and behavioral health care facilities is reflected as a deduction from net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for 2013, 2012 and 2011.
352915_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	The adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial position or overall results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	Net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 49% of our consolidated net revenues in 2013, 50% in 2012 and 51% in 2011.
352915_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues during 2013, 50% during 2012 and 49% during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.
352915_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
352915_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities.
352915_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, and statements of our goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.
352915_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Words such as may, will, should, could, would, predicts, potential, continue, expects, anticipates, future, intends, plans, believes, estimates, appears, projects and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2013 and 2012 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	However, at December 31, 2013, each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P5_S3	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P5_S4	During 2011, we entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $450 million from December, 2011 to December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December, 2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P5_S5	The three-month LIBOR never reached 7.00% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2013, and therefore no payment was made to us.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We also entered into six forward starting interest rate swaps in 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $425 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 1.91%.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $75 million, $25 million and $100 million became effective in December, 2011 and have corresponding fixed rates of 1.32%, 1.96% and 2.50%.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The $75 million and $25 million interest rate swaps matured in December, 2012 and December, 2013, respectively, and the $100 million interest rate swap is scheduled to mature in December, 2014.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	During 2010, we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $600 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Each of the four swaps became effective in December, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we paid a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of $150 million and received three-month LIBOR.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Each of the two interest rate swaps, which are now expired, had an initial notional principal amount of $75 million.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The fixed rate payable on one of the interest rate swaps was 4.87% and it matured in October, 2011.

352915_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P9_S2	We consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $24 million at December 31, 2013, of which $19 million is included in other current liabilities and $5 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P10_S1	At December 31, 2012, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $41 million, substantially all of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.
352915_14_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2013.

352915_14_ITEM15_P13_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Health Services, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
352915_14_ITEM15_P13_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM15_P13_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_14_ITEM15_P13_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, financial statement schedule, and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in item 9A as Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
352915_14_ITEM15_P13_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
352915_14_ITEM15_P13_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
352915_14_ITEM15_P13_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
352915_14_ITEM15_P13_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
352915_14_ITEM15_P13_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
352915_14_ITEM15_P13_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
352915_14_ITEM15_P13_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
352915_14_ITEM15_P14_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_14_ITEM15_P14_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM15_P14_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_14_ITEM15_P14_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

352915_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1) BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Services provided by our hospitals, all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.
352915_14_ITEM15_P20_S1	We, through our subsidiaries, provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
352915_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	The more significant accounting policies follow: A) Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner.
352915_14_ITEM15_P21_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
352915_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_14_ITEM15_P22_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 38% of our net patient revenues during 2013, 39% during 2012 and 41% during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM15_P22_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 49% of our net patient revenues during each of 2013 and 2012 and 47% during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM15_P22_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_14_ITEM15_P22_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_14_ITEM15_P22_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_14_ITEM15_P22_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_14_ITEM15_P22_S7	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_14_ITEM15_P22_S8	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_14_ITEM15_P23_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_14_ITEM15_P23_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_14_ITEM15_P23_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
352915_14_ITEM15_P24_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2013, 2012 or 2011.
352915_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_14_ITEM15_P25_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care and Uninsured Discounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	C) Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_14_ITEM15_P26_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_14_ITEM15_P26_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_14_ITEM15_P26_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_14_ITEM15_P26_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_14_ITEM15_P26_S6	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_14_ITEM15_P26_S7	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	Uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of a minimum of 30% of total charges.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S2	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S3	Potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S4	Our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 includes amounts due from Illinois of approximately $49 million, $70 million and $54 million, respectively.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S5	Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S6	Approximately $28 million as of December 31, 2013, $51 million as of December 31, 2012 and $41 million as of December 31, 2011, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S7	In addition, our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2013 includes approximately $46 million due from Texas in connection with Medicaid supplemental payment programs the majority of which we expect to collect during the second quarter of 2014.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S8	Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois and Texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us (we have received $27 million of cash remittances from Illinois in January, 2014), no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S9	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois and/or Texas.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S10	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S11	On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S12	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $395 million and $311 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S13	D) Concentration of Revenues: Our five majority owned acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined basis, 14% of our consolidated net revenues in each of 2013 and 2012 and 15% in 2011.
352915_14_ITEM15_P28_S14	On a combined basis, our facilities in the McAllen/Edinburg, Texas market (consisting of three acute care facilities, a children s hospital and a behavioral health facility) contributed 4% of our consolidated net revenues in each of 2013 and 2012 and 5% in 2011.
352915_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	E) Charity Care and Uninsured Discounts: A significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_14_ITEM15_P33_S2	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:
352915_14_ITEM15_P33_S3	In addition, the provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals were approximately $1.02 billion during 2013, $635 million during 2012 and $519 million during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM15_P33_S4	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_14_ITEM15_P33_S5	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_14_ITEM15_P33_S6	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	F) Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
352915_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	The regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_14_ITEM15_P34_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_14_ITEM15_P34_S3	We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
352915_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	Medicaid EHR incentive payments: Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria.
352915_14_ITEM15_P36_S1	Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria.
352915_14_ITEM15_P36_S2	Upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods.
352915_14_ITEM15_P36_S3	Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria were included in other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	G) Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
352915_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	H) Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost.
352915_14_ITEM15_P37_S2	Expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts.
352915_14_ITEM15_P37_S3	Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred.
352915_14_ITEM15_P37_S4	We remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	Construction-in-progress includes both construction projects and equipment not yet placed into service.
352915_14_ITEM15_P38_S1	We capitalize interest expense on major construction projects while in progress.
352915_14_ITEM15_P38_S2	We capitalized interest on major construction projects and the development and implementation of electronic health records applications amounting to $4.9 million during 2013, $5.7 million during 2012 and $400,000 during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years).
352915_14_ITEM15_P39_S1	Depreciation expense (excluding discontinued operations) was $285.6 million during 2013, $270.5 million during 2012 and $262.1 million during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	I) Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_14_ITEM15_P40_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_14_ITEM15_P40_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	J) Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_14_ITEM15_P41_S2	We have designated September 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2013 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_14_ITEM15_P41_S3	There were also no impairments during 2012 or 2011.
352915_14_ITEM15_P41_S4	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2013 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	(a) The reduction to the Behavioral Health Services goodwill consists primarily of a reclassification to assets of facilities held for sale and represents the goodwill attributable to Peak Behavioral Health Services which we agreed to divest pursuant to our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	Adjustments to prior year purchase price allocations for Acute Care and Behavioral Health Services are also included.
352915_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	(b) The increase in the Behavioral Health Services goodwill consists primarily of an amount that was reclassified from other assets.
352915_14_ITEM15_P44_S1	Other Assets: Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010 and Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012, consisting of Medicare licenses, certificates of need and contracts to manage the operations of behavioral health services owned by third-parties (PSI only); (ii) prepaid fees for various software and other applications used by our hospitals; (iii) costs incurred in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities; (iv) deposits; (v) investments in various businesses, including Universal Health Realty Income Trust; (vi) the invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related payable included in other noncurrent liabilities; (vii) the estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and; (viii) other miscellaneous assets.
352915_14_ITEM15_P44_S2	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $97 million and $99 million, respectively.
352915_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	L) Physician Guarantees and Commitments: As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our accrued liabilities-other, and our other assets included $3 million, as of each respective date, of estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments.
352915_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	The $3 million of potential future financial obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2013 are potential 2014 obligations.
352915_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	M) Self-Insured Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_14_ITEM15_P46_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_14_ITEM15_P46_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_14_ITEM15_P46_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_14_ITEM15_P46_S5	See Note 8 for discussion of adjustments to our prior year reserves for claims related to our self-insured general and professional liability and workers compensation liability.
352915_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	In addition, we also maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	The ultimate costs related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	N) Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM15_P48_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_14_ITEM15_P50_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_14_ITEM15_P50_S2	See Note 6 Income Taxes, for additional disclosure.
352915_14_ITEM15_P50_S3	Other Noncurrent Liabilities: Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general liability, workers compensation reserves, pension and deferred compensation liabilities, liability incurred in connection with split-dollar life insurance agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife and interest rate swap liabilities.
352915_14_ITEM15_P50_S4	Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest:
352915_14_ITEM15_P50_S5	Outside owners hold noncontrolling, minority ownership interests of: (i) approximately 28% in our five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada; (ii) 20% in an acute care facility located in Washington, D.C.; (iii) approximately 11% in an acute care facility located in Laredo, Texas, and; (iv) 20% in a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
352915_14_ITEM15_P50_S6	The redeemable noncontrolling interest balances of $218 million and $234 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and the noncontrolling interest balances of $50 million and $53 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, consist primarily of the third-party ownership interests in these hospitals.
352915_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	In connection with the five acute care facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain put rights , that are currently exercisable, that if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member s interests at fair market value.
352915_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.
352915_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	In connection with the behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_14_ITEM15_P52_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities, pursuant to the terms of the put options, approximates the book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests.
352915_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	Q) Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive income or loss is comprised of net income, changes in unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and a pension liability.
352915_14_ITEM15_P53_S1	The accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) component of stockholders equity includes: net unrealized gains and losses on effective cash flow hedges; and the net minimum pension liability of a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan which covers employees at one of our subsidiaries.
352915_14_ITEM15_P53_S2	See Note 10, Pension Plan for additional disclosure regarding the defined benefit pension plan.
352915_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	The amounts recognized in AOCI for the two years ended December 31, 2013 were as follows (in thousands): R) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities: We manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_14_ITEM15_P55_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within stockholders equity.
352915_14_ITEM15_P55_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_14_ITEM15_P56_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_14_ITEM15_P56_S3	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
352915_14_ITEM15_P56_S4	Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.
352915_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	S) Stock-Based Compensation: At December 31, 2013, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans.
352915_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	Pursuant to the FASB s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
352915_14_ITEM15_P58_S2	The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge.
352915_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.
352915_14_ITEM15_P59_S1	The applicable FASB guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows.
352915_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
352915_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.
352915_14_ITEM15_P60_S2	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated:
352915_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Net effect of dilutive stock options and grants based on the treasury stock method , for all years presented above, excludes certain outstanding stock options applicable to each year since the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
352915_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	The excluded weighted-average stock options totaled 4,000 during 2013, 2.0 million during 2012, 1.4 million during 2011.
352915_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	U) Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The fair values of our registered debt and investments are based on quoted market prices.
352915_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar maturities and credit quality.
352915_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	V) Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
352915_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
352915_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	W) Mergers and Acquisitions: The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions.
352915_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
352915_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
352915_14_ITEM15_P66_S2	Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred.
352915_14_ITEM15_P66_S3	The fair value of intangible assets, including Medicare Licenses, Certificates of Need, and certain contracts, is based on significant judgments made by our management, and accordingly, for significant items we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.
352915_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	During 2013, we entered into a new group purchasing organization agreement ( GPO ) and acquired a minority interest in the GPO for a nominal amount.
352915_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	In connection with the completion of an initial public offering of the stock of the GPO, during the fourth quarter of 2013, we received cash proceeds for the sale of a portion of our ownership interest, which were recorded as deferred income and included in liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM15_P67_S2	The deferred income will be recognized, on a pro rata basis, as a reduction to our supplies expense over the expected life of the GPO agreement.
352915_14_ITEM15_P67_S3	Also in connection with this GPO agreement and related minority interest ownership, we received shares of restricted stock in the GPO which vest ratably over a seven-year period, contingent upon our continued participation and minority ownership interest in the GPO.
352915_14_ITEM15_P67_S4	We will recognize the fair value of this restricted stock, as a reduction to our supplies expense, in our consolidated statements of income on a pro rata basis over the vesting period.
352915_14_ITEM15_P67_S5	Y) Accounting Standards: Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Other Comprehensive Income:
352915_14_ITEM15_P67_S6	In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update on reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
352915_14_ITEM15_P67_S7	This guidance, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2012, requires companies to provide information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component (the respective line items of the income statement).
352915_14_ITEM15_P67_S8	The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2013 had no impact on our financial position or overall results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	No. 2011-07, Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities, which required certain health care entities to change the presentation in their statement of operations by reclassifying the provision for bad debts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts).
352915_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	As a result, the provision for doubtful accounts for our acute care and behavioral health care facilities is reflected as a deduction from net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each of the years presented herein.
352915_14_ITEM15_P68_S2	The adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial position or overall results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward Exists: In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance regarding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.
352915_14_ITEM15_P69_S1	Under certain circumstances, unrecognized tax benefits should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.
352915_14_ITEM15_P69_S2	The guidance is a change in financial statement presentation only and has no material impact in the consolidated financial results.
352915_14_ITEM15_P69_S3	The guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2014 on either a prospective or retrospective basis.
352915_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	2) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES Year ended December 31, 2013: 2013 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2013, we spent an aggregate of $13 million for the purchase of real property located in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.
352915_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	The aggregate net purchase price of these properties was allocated to property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: During 2013, we received an aggregate of $37 million in connection with the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services (sold during the second quarter of 2013) and certain other assets and real property including three previously closed behavioral health care facilities.
352915_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	As discussed below in Discontinued Operations , we agreed to sell Peak Behavioral Health Services as part of our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation ( Ascend ) in October of 2012.
352915_14_ITEM15_P71_S2	The aggregate pre-tax gain on these divestitures was approximately $3 million and in included in our 2013 consolidated results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM15_P71_S3	Year ended December 31, 2012: 2012 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2012, we spent $528 million to acquire the following assets and businesses:
352915_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	spent $25 million in connection with the acquisition of physician practices and various real property.
352915_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows: Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price.
352915_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities: (i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.
352915_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	Assuming the acquisition of Ascend occurred on January 1, 2011, our 2011 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $6.90 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS and unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $401 million and $4.06 per diluted share, respectively.
352915_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	The 2011 unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS and unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share include the after-tax impact of the transaction costs incurred by us in connection with the acquisition of Ascend amounting to $5 million or $.06 per diluted share.
352915_14_ITEM15_P74_S2	Our 2012 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $7.11 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS and unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $464 million and $4.74 per diluted share, respectively.
352915_14_ITEM15_P74_S3	During the period of October 10, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the facilities acquired from Ascend generated $42 million of net revenues which are included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM15_P74_S4	The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the date of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, and less the above-mentioned transaction costs, was not material to our 2012 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	2012 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: During 2012, we received $149 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:
352915_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	received an aggregate of $6 million for the sale of the real property of two non-operating behavioral health facilities and our majority ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center located in Puerto Rico.
352915_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	Included in our 2012 consolidated results of operations was a $26 million pre-tax gain on the divestiture of Auburn.
352915_14_ITEM15_P76_S2	The divestiture of San Juan Capestrano (in January, 2012) did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	Year ended December 31, 2011: 2011 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2011, we spent $29 million on the acquisition of businesses and real property, including the following:
352915_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	the acquisition of a cardiology practice in Texas.
352915_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	The aggregate net cash expenditure related to the properties and/or businesses was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:
352915_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	2011 Divestitures of Assets and Businesses: During 2011, we received $68 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:
352915_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	the real property of a closed acute care hospital.
352915_14_ITEM15_P81_S1	The aggregate pre-tax net gain on these divestitures did not have a material impact on our 2011 consolidated results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	Discontinued Operations: In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of Ascend in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services ( Peak ), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
352915_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	The divestiture of Peak was completed during the second quarter of 2013 for total cash proceeds of approximately $24 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million which is included in our 2013 consolidated financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	In October of 2012, we completed the divestiture of Auburn, a 159-bed acute care hospital located in Auburn, Washington, for total cash proceeds of approximately $93 million.
352915_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	This divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $26 million which was included in our 2012 consolidated financial statements.
352915_14_ITEM15_P83_S2	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities as well as one of our legacy behavioral health facilities in Puerto Rico.
352915_14_ITEM15_P83_S3	Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the FTC, we divested:
352915_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	in January, 2012, the Hospital San Juan Capestrano, a 108-bed facility located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.
352915_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	The operating results for Auburn, Peak and the three former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada are reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership during each of the years presented herein.
352915_14_ITEM15_P85_S1	Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.
352915_14_ITEM15_P85_S2	Assets and liabilities for Peak were reflected as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012.
352915_14_ITEM15_P85_S3	The following table shows the results of operations for Auburn and Peak and the former PSI facilities located in Delaware and Nevada, on a combined basis, which were reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership for each of the years presented herein (amounts in thousands):
352915_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges: During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we had no fair value hedges outstanding.
352915_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	Cash Flow Hedges: We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_14_ITEM15_P87_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_14_ITEM15_P88_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_14_ITEM15_P88_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_14_ITEM15_P88_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_14_ITEM15_P88_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_14_ITEM15_P88_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_14_ITEM15_P89_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_14_ITEM15_P89_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_14_ITEM15_P89_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_14_ITEM15_P91_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2013 and 2012 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_14_ITEM15_P91_S2	We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_14_ITEM15_P92_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_14_ITEM15_P92_S1	However, at December 31, 2013, each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties.
352915_14_ITEM15_P92_S2	We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties.
352915_14_ITEM15_P92_S3	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
352915_14_ITEM15_P92_S4	During 2011, we entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $450 million from December, 2011 to December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December, 2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap.
352915_14_ITEM15_P92_S5	The three-month LIBOR never reached 7.00% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2013, and therefore no payment was made to us.
352915_14_ITEM15_P93_S0	We also entered into six forward starting interest rate swaps in 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $425 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_14_ITEM15_P93_S1	Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	payable on these swaps is 1.91%.
352915_14_ITEM15_P94_S1	The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $75 million, $25 million and $100 million became effective in December, 2011 and have corresponding fixed rates of 1.32%, 1.96% and 2.50%.

352915_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis.
352915_14_ITEM15_P97_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks.
352915_14_ITEM15_P97_S2	We consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities.
352915_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $24 million at December 31, 2013, of which $19 million is included in other current liabilities and $5 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.

352915_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Third Amendment provides for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with certain borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
352915_14_ITEM15_P100_S1	Upon the effectiveness of the Third Amendment, UHS replaced its existing $745.9 million senior secured Tranche B term loan with a new senior secured Tranche B-1 term loan in the same amount on substantially the same terms as the Tranche B term loan, other than lower interest rates.
352915_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	Borrowings under the Tranche B-1 term loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, one, two, three or six month LIBOR, plus an applicable margin of 2.25% or ABR plus an applicable margin of 1.25%.
352915_14_ITEM15_P101_S1	The minimum LIBOR and ABR rates for the Tranche B term loan of 1.0% and 2.0%, respectively, were eliminated.
352915_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	In September, 2012, we entered into a second amendment ( Second Amendment ) to our Credit Agreement which provided for: (i) a new $900 million Term Loan-A ( Term Loan A2 ) at the same interest rates as our existing Term Loan A and a final maturity date of August 15, 2016; (ii) the extension of the maturity date on a substantial portion of our $800 million revolving credit facility commitment with $777 million of the commitment extended to mature on August 15, 2016 and the remaining $23 million commitment scheduled to mature on November 15, 2015 (there were no borrowings outstanding pursuant to our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2013), and; (iii) the extension of the maturity date on a substantial portion of our Term Loan-A borrowings which, based upon the outstanding Term Loan-A borrowings as of December 31, 2013, $892 million is scheduled to mature on August 15, 2016 and the remaining $43 million is scheduled to mature on November 15, 2015.
352915_14_ITEM15_P102_S1	The Second Amendment also provides for increased flexibility for refinancing and certain other modifications but substantially all other terms of the Credit Agreement remain unchanged.
352915_14_ITEM15_P103_S0	In September, 2012, we used $700 million of the proceeds from the new Term Loan A2 facility to extinguish a portion of our higher priced, Term Loan-B facility.
352915_14_ITEM15_P103_S1	Pricing under the new Term Loan A2 facility was 1% lower than the Term Loan-B facility and did not include a LIBOR Floor whereas, at that time, the Term Loan-B facility had a 1% LIBOR Floor (which has since been eliminated as part of the above-mentioned Third Amendment in May, 2013).
352915_14_ITEM15_P104_S0	During the third quarter of 2012, in connection with the extinguishment of a portion of our Term Loan-B facility, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $29 million to write-off the related portion of the Term Loan-B deferred financing costs.
352915_14_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Credit Agreement, as amended, is a senior secured facility which, as of December 31, 2013, provided for an aggregate commitment amount of $3.16 billion, comprised of an $800 million revolving credit facility, a $939 million Term Loan-A facility, a $550 million Term Loan-B facility and a $872 million Term Loan-A2 facility.
352915_14_ITEM15_P105_S1	The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit.
352915_14_ITEM15_P105_S2	The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
352915_14_ITEM15_P105_S3	Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the lender s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 borrowings and 1.25% for Term Loan B borrowings or (2) the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 borrowings and 2.25% for Term Loan-B borrowings.
352915_14_ITEM15_P105_S4	The current applicable margins are 0.50% for ABR-based loans, 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit, Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities and 2.25% under the Term Loan-B facility.
352915_14_ITEM15_P106_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had no borrowings outstanding pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility and we had $755 million of available borrowing capacity, net of $25 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to a short-term, on-demand credit facility and $20 million of outstanding letters of credit.
352915_14_ITEM15_P107_S0	During 2013, we made scheduled principal payments of $72 million on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan A2 facilities.
352915_14_ITEM15_P107_S1	Quarterly installment payments ( Installment Payments ) are due on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities which approximate $72 million in 2014, $77 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2016.
352915_14_ITEM15_P107_S2	The Installment Payments due on the Term Loan-A and Term Loan-A2 facilities during 2014 are classified as current maturities of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2013.
352915_14_ITEM15_P107_S3	Although no Installment Payments are due on the Term Loan-B facility, we made optional repayments of $196 million during the fourth quarter of 2013.
352915_14_ITEM15_P107_S4	In October, 2013 our $275 million accounts receivable securitization program ( Securitization ) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks was amended to extend the maturity date to October 25, 2016 and reduce the interest rate spread and commitment fee.
352915_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals ( Receivables ) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings.
352915_14_ITEM15_P108_S1	We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings.
352915_14_ITEM15_P108_S2	We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us.
352915_14_ITEM15_P108_S3	The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities.
352915_14_ITEM15_P108_S4	The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_14_ITEM15_P108_S5	The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans.
352915_14_ITEM15_P108_S6	At December 31, 2013, we had $240 million of outstanding borrowings and $35 million of additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_14_ITEM15_P108_S7	Our $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the Unsecured Notes ) are scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018.

352915_14_ITEM15_P108_S12	These Unsecured Notes are guaranteed by a group of subsidiaries (each of which is a 100% directly or indirectly owned subsidiary of Universal Health Services, Inc.) which fully and unconditionally guarantee the Unsecured Notes on a joint and several basis, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions.
352915_14_ITEM15_P108_S13	On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the 7.125% Notes ).

352915_14_ITEM15_P108_S16	Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.
352915_14_ITEM15_P109_S0	In connection with the entering into of the Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and in accordance with the Indenture dated January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2016) were equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.

352915_14_ITEM15_P115_S1	There is no expiration date for our stock repurchase programs.

352915_14_ITEM15_P119_S4	In accordance with ASC 718, excess income tax benefits related to stock based compensation are classified as cash inflows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
352915_14_ITEM15_P119_S5	Previously for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we included $16.0 million and $7.6 million, respectively, of excess income tax benefits related to stock based compensation as net cash provided by operating activities as included in the change in accrued and deferred income taxes for each year.
352915_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	In our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, as included herein, those amounts are reflected as cash inflows from financing activities for each respective year.
352915_14_ITEM15_P120_S1	We assessed this misclassification and concluded that it was not material to our previously issued annual and quarterly Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
352915_14_ITEM15_P120_S2	During 2013, we generated $20.1 million of excess income tax benefits related to stock based compensation which are reflected as cash inflows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

352915_14_ITEM15_P123_S5	The following weighted average assumptions were derived from averaging the number of options granted during the most recent five-year period.
352915_14_ITEM15_P123_S6	The weighted-average assumptions reflected below were each based upon eighteen option grants.
352915_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon four year yield in effect at the time of grant.
352915_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	The expected life of the stock options granted was estimated using the historical behavior of employees.
352915_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	Expected volatility was based on historical volatility for a period equal to the stock option s expected life.

352915_14_ITEM15_P141_S0	6) INCOME TAXES Components of income tax expense/(benefit) are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	Deferred taxes are required to be classified based on the financial statement classification of the related assets and liabilities which give rise to temporary differences.
352915_14_ITEM15_P143_S0	Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
352915_14_ITEM15_P143_S1	The components of deferred taxes are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_14_ITEM15_P143_S2	There was no material impact of deferred taxes recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation.
352915_14_ITEM15_P144_S0	The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (dollar amounts in thousands): Impacting the effective tax rates during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were favorable discrete tax items of approximately $1 million recorded during each year to adjust the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions.
352915_14_ITEM15_P144_S1	A reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows: Included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are prepaid federal, foreign, and state income taxes amounting to approximately $5 million and $7 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
352915_14_ITEM15_P144_S2	The net deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised as follows (amounts in thousands): The assets and liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible patient accounts, compensation-related accruals and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self- insurance reserves.
352915_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	At December 31, 2013, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2014 through 2033), and credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $959 million, representing approximately $47 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit).
352915_14_ITEM15_P145_S1	At December 31, 2013, there were foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $8 million expiring through 2021 representing approximately $3 million in deferred foreign tax benefit.
352915_14_ITEM15_P146_S0	A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
352915_14_ITEM15_P146_S1	Based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized.
352915_14_ITEM15_P146_S2	Therefore, valuation allowances of approximately $44 million and $41 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
352915_14_ITEM15_P146_S3	During 2013, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by approximately $3 million due to additional net operating losses incurred.
352915_14_ITEM15_P146_S4	In addition, valuation allowances of approximately $3 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 related to foreign net operating losses.
352915_14_ITEM15_P146_S5	There were no significant increases in valuation allowances as a result of the acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation.
352915_14_ITEM15_P147_S0	We adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007.
352915_14_ITEM15_P147_S1	During 2013 and 2012, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased less than $1 million due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years.
352915_14_ITEM15_P147_S2	During 2013, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately $1 million.
352915_14_ITEM15_P147_S3	The balance at each of December 31, 2013 and 2012, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately $2 million and $4 million, respectively.
352915_14_ITEM15_P147_S4	We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.
352915_14_ITEM15_P147_S5	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we have accrued interest and penalties of less than $1 million as of each date.
352915_14_ITEM15_P147_S6	The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2010 and subsequent years.
352915_14_ITEM15_P148_S0	Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years.
352915_14_ITEM15_P148_S1	The statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months.
352915_14_ITEM15_P148_S2	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months, however, it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.
352915_14_ITEM15_P148_S3	The tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is as follows (amounts in thousands).

352915_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our Mission Our mission and objective is to provide superior healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends, physicians prefer for their patients, purchasers select for their clients, employees are proud of, and investors seek for long-term results.
352915_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	To achieve this, we have a commitment to:
352915_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	innovation in service delivery Business Strategy We believe community-based hospitals will remain the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of self-determination for both the company and our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	We selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities.
352915_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	We are committed to a program of rational growth around our core businesses, while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve.
352915_15_ITEM1_P5_S3	Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities.
352915_15_ITEM1_P5_S4	We also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.
352915_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Improvement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.
352915_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	We also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.
352915_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities.
352915_15_ITEM1_P6_S3	From time to time applications are filed with state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need, or CONs.
352915_15_ITEM1_P6_S4	Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	We are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees, communities and our stockholders.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S4	In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S5	We believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S6	Generally, we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S7	Other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S8	Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S9	Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S10	We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S11	In addition, hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S12	The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated.
352915_15_ITEM1_P7_S13	Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture.
352915_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	(1) Average Available Beds is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available for patient care.
352915_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	(2) Patient Days is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.
352915_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	(3) Occupancy Rate is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of average beds, either available or licensed.
352915_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Sources of Revenue We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Sources of Revenue for additional disclosure.
352915_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Reporting.
352915_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self-referrals by physicians).
352915_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected.
352915_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.
352915_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness.
352915_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments.
352915_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.
352915_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	All of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by The Joint Commission.
352915_15_ITEM1_P13_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_15_ITEM1_P13_S5	If any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors.
352915_15_ITEM1_P13_S6	We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards.
352915_15_ITEM1_P13_S7	The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Certificates of Need: Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need ( CON ) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility s license, which could harm our business.
352915_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions.
352915_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_15_ITEM1_P16_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Utilization Review: Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services.
352915_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	The law and regulations require Peer Review Organizations ( PROs ) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group ( DRG ) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay.
352915_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program.
352915_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.
352915_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Audits: Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims.
352915_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights.
352915_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	third-party recovery audit contractors ( RACs ) and Medicaid integrity contractors ( MICs ), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers.
352915_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	The Recovery Audit Prepayment Review demonstration program will enable RACs to review claims before they are paid to ensure that the provider complied with all Medicare payment rules.
352915_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	Currently, the demonstration program is targeting states with high populations of fraud- and error-prone providers.
352915_15_ITEM1_P20_S3	Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors ( ZPICs ) target claims for potential fraud and abuse.
352915_15_ITEM1_P20_S4	Additionally, Medicare administrative contractors ( MACs ) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers.
352915_15_ITEM1_P20_S5	The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) announced its intent to consolidate many of these Medicare and Medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors ( UPICs ), though it remains unclear what effect, if any, this proposed consolidation may have.
352915_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years, the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial.
352915_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
352915_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation The Stark Law:
352915_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met.
352915_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	These types of referrals are known as self-referrals.
352915_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to $15,000 for each violation, up to $100,000 for sham arrangements, up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs.
352915_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart.
352915_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities.
352915_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	This recent regulation also places a number of compliance requirements on physician-owned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest.
352915_15_ITEM1_P25_S3	There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.
352915_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.
352915_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Anti-kickback Statute: A provision of the Social Security Act known as the anti-kickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program.
352915_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	However, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti-kickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law.
352915_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	The anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors, from the federal anti-kickback statute for various activities.
352915_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services.
352915_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
352915_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws.
352915_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Similar State Laws: Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care.
352915_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure.
352915_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes.
352915_15_ITEM1_P32_S3	However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
352915_15_ITEM1_P32_S4	These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_15_ITEM1_P32_S5	It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_15_ITEM1_P32_S6	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see Item 3.
352915_15_ITEM1_P32_S7	Legal Proceedings), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_15_ITEM1_P32_S8	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_15_ITEM1_P32_S9	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs.
352915_15_ITEM1_P32_S10	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations: A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the False Claims Act s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions.
352915_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.
352915_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	When a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim.
352915_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act.
352915_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government.
352915_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 ( FERA ) has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds.
352915_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	FERA also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments.
352915_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act.
352915_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court.
352915_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Recent changes to the False Claims Act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified, or by the date any corresponding cost report was due, whichever is later.
352915_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil False Claims Act liability.
352915_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions: The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud.
352915_15_ITEM1_P39_S4	Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.
352915_15_ITEM1_P39_S5	Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs.
352915_15_ITEM1_P39_S6	HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare.
352915_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.
352915_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:
352915_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH ), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically.
352915_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry.
352915_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information.
352915_15_ITEM1_P41_S3	The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed.
352915_15_ITEM1_P41_S4	Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.
352915_15_ITEM1_P41_S5	We believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of HIPAA, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance.
352915_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information.
352915_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements.
352915_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	HITECH has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred.
352915_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	We believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date.
352915_15_ITEM1_P42_S4	Recent changes to the HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers, including expanded obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.
352915_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft.
352915_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010, signed on December 18, 2010, appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the Red Flags Rule, but permits the FTC or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the Red Flags Rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft.
352915_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	Compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future.
352915_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005: On July 29, 2005, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 was enacted, which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety.
352915_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	This legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report Patient Safety Work Product ( PSWP ) to Patient Safety Organizations ( PSOs ).
352915_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	is made privileged, confidential and legally protected from disclosure.
352915_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	PSWP does not include medical, discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety.
352915_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	This legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute PSWP.
352915_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	PSOs are certified by the Secretary of the HHS for three-year periods and analyze PSWP, provide feedback to providers and may report non-identifiable PSWP to a database.
352915_15_ITEM1_P45_S4	In addition, PSOs are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies.
352915_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs.
352915_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.
352915_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine: Several states, including Florida, Nevada, California and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services.
352915_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties.
352915_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable.
352915_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	These statutes and/or regulations vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.
352915_15_ITEM1_P47_S4	We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians.
352915_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.
352915_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	EMTALA: All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act ( EMTALA ).
352915_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	This federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition.
352915_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment.
352915_15_ITEM1_P49_S3	There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay.
352915_15_ITEM1_P49_S4	Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program.
352915_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.
352915_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions.
352915_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	CMS has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments.
352915_15_ITEM1_P51_S3	The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future.
352915_15_ITEM1_P51_S4	We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.
352915_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Legal Proceedings included herein for additional disclosure.
352915_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	In addition, currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P53_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.
352915_15_ITEM1_P53_S4	Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P53_S5	It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity.
352915_15_ITEM1_P53_S6	It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.
352915_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them.
352915_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.
352915_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	State Rate Review: Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state.
352915_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform: Medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level.
352915_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	All states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits.
352915_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	Over half of the states have limits on damages awards.
352915_15_ITEM1_P56_S3	Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits, and many states have established limits on attorney fees.
352915_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	Many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform.
352915_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform, and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates.
352915_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	Reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.
352915_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	Compliance Program: Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998.
352915_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	Currently, the program s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program s policies.
352915_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	Since its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry s expectations and our needs.
352915_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business.
352915_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program.
352915_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas.
352915_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.
352915_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	Medical Staff and Employees Our facilities had approximately 68,700 employees on December 31, 2014, of whom approximately 48,700 were employed full-time.
352915_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	In a number of our markets, physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours.
352915_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	Within our acute care division, approximately 160 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P61_S3	Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time.
352915_15_ITEM1_P61_S4	In addition, within our behavioral health division, approximately 400 psychiatrists are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P61_S5	Each of our hospitals is managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of ours.
352915_15_ITEM1_P61_S6	In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital.
352915_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
352915_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	Approximately 1,750 of our employees at seven of our hospitals are unionized.
352915_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	At Valley Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating Engineers and the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ).
352915_15_ITEM1_P62_S3	Nurses and technicians at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the SEIU and International Union of Operating Engineers.
352915_15_ITEM1_P62_S4	At The George Washington University Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the SEIU or the Hospital Police Association.
352915_15_ITEM1_P62_S5	At the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, clinical, clerical, support and maintenance employees are represented by the Communication Workers of America (AFL-CIO).
352915_15_ITEM1_P62_S6	Nurses at Corona Regional Medical Center are represented by the United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals (UNAC/UHCP).
352915_15_ITEM1_P62_S7	Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain technicians and therapists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU.
352915_15_ITEM1_P62_S8	At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Teamsters and the Northwestern Nurses Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals.
352915_15_ITEM1_P62_S9	A union representation election was held at Rock River Academy and Residential Center ( RRARC ) in August, 2014 for the Mental Health Technicians, LPNs, Drivers and Teachers Assistants.
352915_15_ITEM1_P62_S10	The results of the election were not determinative, however, and in light of the decision to terminate RRARC s contract with Illinois Department of Children and Family Services and close the facility, we are in the process of resolving all outstanding NLRB litigation and fulfilling its statutory obligations to displaced workers under state and federal labor laws.
352915_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	The health care industry is highly competitive.
352915_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment.
352915_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes.
352915_15_ITEM1_P64_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us.
352915_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.
352915_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in determining a hospital s success and competitive advantage.
352915_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient s needs, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital s facilities.
352915_15_ITEM1_P67_S3	We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.
352915_15_ITEM1_P67_S4	In addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals.
352915_15_ITEM1_P67_S5	We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_15_ITEM1_P67_S6	Our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate.
352915_15_ITEM1_P67_S7	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_15_ITEM1_P67_S8	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	Many states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws.
352915_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states.
352915_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.
352915_15_ITEM1_P68_S3	Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges.
352915_15_ITEM1_P69_S2	In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients.
352915_15_ITEM1_P69_S3	Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience.
352915_15_ITEM1_P69_S4	The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.
352915_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	A key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets.
352915_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	The competition to acquire hospitals is significant.
352915_15_ITEM1_P70_S2	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_15_ITEM1_P70_S3	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_15_ITEM1_P70_S4	We intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.
352915_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust: At December 31, 2014, we held approximately 5.9% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the Trust ).
352915_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust.
352915_15_ITEM1_P72_S1	Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.
352915_15_ITEM1_P72_S2	We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $2.5 million during 2014, $2.4 million during 2013 and $2.1 million during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM1_P72_S3	Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $3.2 million during 2014, $842,000 during 2013 and $1.2 million during 2012, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year.
352915_15_ITEM1_P72_S4	Included in our share of the Trust s income for 2014 and 2012 was approximately $2.3 million in 2014 and $500,000 in 2012 related to our share of the net favorable impact realized by the Trust in connection with: (i) gains on the sale of medical office buildings (in 2012); (ii) gain on sale of a behavioral health hospital facility (in 2014), and; (iii) gain on fair value recognition resulting from the Trust s purchase of minority ownership interests in majority owned limited liability companies (in 2014).
352915_15_ITEM1_P72_S5	The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $9.3 million and $8.1 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
352915_15_ITEM1_P72_S6	The market value of our investment in the Trust was $37.9 million at December 31, 2014 and $31.5 million at December 31, 2013, based on the closing price of the Trust s stock on the respective dates.
352915_15_ITEM1_P72_S7	Total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the Trust (as discussed below) was $16.8 million during 2014, $16.4 million during 2013 and $16.3 million during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM1_P72_S8	In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by the Trust or by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds 100% of the ownership interest.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S2	Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S3	The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S4	The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S5	During the third quarter of 2014, we provided notification to the Trust that, upon the December, 2014 expiration of the The Bridgeway s lease term, we intended to exercise our option to purchase the real property of the facility.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S6	On December 31, 2014, we purchased The Bridgeway s real property (a 103-bed behavioral health facility located in North Little Rock, Arkansas) from the Trust.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S7	Pursuant to the terms of the lease, we and the Trust were both required to obtain appraisals of the property to determine its fair market value.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S8	Based upon the property appraisals obtained by each party, the purchase price of The Bridgeway s real property was approximately $17.3 million.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S9	In addition, we recently constructed two free-standing emergency departments ( FEDs ) located in Weslaco and Mission, Texas which were completed and opened during the first quarter of 2015.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S10	The Trust purchased one of these FEDs from us in January, 2015 and the other in February, 2015.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S11	In conjunction with these sales, wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours, which will operate the FEDs, executed agreements with the Trust to lease the properties for initial terms of 10-years with six, 5-year renewal options.
352915_15_ITEM1_P73_S12	The aggregate construction cost/sales proceeds of these facilities was approximately $12.8 million and the aggregate rent expense paid to the Trust at the commencement of the leases will approximate $900,000 annually.
352915_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	The table below details the renewal options and terms for each of our three hospital facilities leased from the Trust as of December 31, 2014:
352915_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	(a) We have three 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).
352915_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term.
352915_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.
352915_15_ITEM1_P76_S2	We also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at their appraised fair market value as well as purchase any or all of the three leased hospital properties at their appraised fair market value upon one month s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur.
352915_15_ITEM1_P76_S3	The executive officers, whose terms will expire at such time as their successors are elected, are as follows:
352915_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	Senior Vice President, President of Acute Care Division Mr. Alan B. Miller has been Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since inception and also served as President from inception until May, 2009.
352915_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	Prior thereto, he was President, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of American Medicorp, Inc.
352915_15_ITEM1_P77_S2	He currently serves as Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of Universal Health Realty Income Trust.
352915_15_ITEM1_P77_S3	He is the father of Marc D. Miller, our President and Director.
352915_15_ITEM1_P77_S4	Mr. Marc D. Miller was elected President in May, 2009 and prior thereto served as Senior Vice President and co-head of our Acute Care Hospitals since 2007.
352915_15_ITEM1_P77_S5	He was elected a Director in May, 2006 and Vice President in 2005.
352915_15_ITEM1_P77_S6	He has served in various capacities related to our acute care division since 2000.
352915_15_ITEM1_P77_S7	He was elected to the Board of Trustees of Universal Health Realty Income Trust in December, 2008.
352915_15_ITEM1_P77_S8	He is the son of Alan B. Miller, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.
352915_15_ITEM1_P77_S9	Mr. Filton was elected Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in 2003 and he was elected Secretary in 1999.
352915_15_ITEM1_P77_S10	He had served as Vice President and Controller since 1991 and Director of Corporate Accounting since 1985.

352915_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	Mr. Pember commenced employment with us in August, 2011 and serves as President of our Acute Care Division.
352915_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	He was formerly employed for 12 years at Indiana University Health, Inc. (formerly known as Clarian Health Partners, Inc.), a nonprofit hospital system that operates multiple facilities in Indiana, where he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also impact our business and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	A significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in Texas, Nevada and California.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We own 7 acute care hospitals and 22 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 18% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2014, 2013 and 2012.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 17% in 2014, 15% in 2013, and 12% in 2012 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We own 6 acute care hospitals and 4 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 16% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2014, 2013 and 2012.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 11% in 2014, 6% in 2013, and 8% in 2012 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	California: We own 5 acute care hospitals and 6 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 10% in 2014, 9% in 2013, and 10% in 2012 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 8% in 2014, 4% in 2013, and 6% in 2012 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	The significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative, regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in Texas Nevada and California.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We derive a significant portion of our revenue from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, the vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom are derived from governmental payors.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If the rates paid or the scope of services covered by governmental payors in the United States or United Kingdom are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Nevada, Virginia and Florida, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Based upon the state budgets for those states for the 2015 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2014), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates were relatively unchanged from the 2014 fiscal year rates.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors, including managed care providers, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Private payors, including managed care providers, increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Reductions or changes in Medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	On January 3, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the 2012 Act ).
352915_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The 2012 Act postponed for two months sequestration cuts mandated under the Budget Control Act of 2011.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The postponed sequestration cuts include a 2% annual reduction over ten years in Medicare spending to providers.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In order to offset the costs of the legislation, the 2012 Act reduces payments to other providers totaling almost $26 billion over ten years.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Approximately half of those funds will come from reductions in Medicare reimbursement to hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 has reduced certain sequestration-related budgetary cuts, spending reductions related to the Medicare program remain in place.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	On December 26, 2013, President Obama signed into law H.J. Res. 59, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which includes the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 ( the Act ).
352915_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, on February 15, 2014, Public Law 113-082 was enacted.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The Act and subsequent federal legislation achieves new savings by extending sequestration for mandatory programs including Medicare for another three years, through 2024.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Sources of Revenue-Medicare , for additional disclosure.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The 2012 Act includes a document and coding ( DCI ) adjustment and a reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital ( DSH ) payments.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Expected to save $10.5 billion over 10 years, the DCI adjustment decreases projected Medicare hospital payments for inpatient and overnight care through a downward adjustment in annual base payment increases.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	These reductions are meant to recoup what Medicare authorities consider to be overpayments to hospitals that occurred as a result of the transition to Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The reduction in Medicaid DSH payments is expected to save $4.2 billion over 10 years.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	This provision extends the changes regarding DSH payments established by the Legislation and determines future allotments off of the rebased level.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA ).
352915_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Reconciliation Act ), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the Legislation ), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	It has been projected that the Legislation will result in a net reduction in Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals totaling $155 billion over 10 years.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Legislation revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning October 1, 2011 for Medicare Part B reimbursable items and services and beginning October 1, 2012 for Medicare inpatient hospital services.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The Legislation and subsequent revisions provide for reductions to both Medicare DSH and Medicaid DSH payments.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The Medicare DSH reductions began in October, 2013 with no material adverse impact to the reimbursements we receive expected until 2015 while Medicaid DSH reimbursements would not be adversely impacted until 2016.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Legislation implements a value-based purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or hospital-acquired condition rates.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government s ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the Legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Pursuant to that decision, the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing Medicaid funding.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Therefore, states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of federal Medicaid funding.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	As a result, many states, including Texas, have not expanded their Medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There have been several attempts in Congress to repeal or modify various provisions of the PPACA.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We cannot predict whether or not any of these proposed changes to the PPACA will become law and therefore can provide no assurance that changes to the PPACA, as currently implemented, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition, a case currently pending before The Supreme Court of the United States, King vs. Burwell , challenges the federal government s ability to subsidize premiums paid by certain eligible individuals that obtain health insurance policies through federally facilitated exchanges.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	A number of our hospitals operate in states that utilize federally facilitated exchanges.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Supreme Court of the United States decision in this case could result in an increased number of uninsured patients treated at our hospitals located in these states which would have an adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The various provisions in the Legislation that directly or indirectly affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The impact of the Legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations, interpretive guidance and possible future legislation or legal challenges.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Certain Legislation provisions, such as those creating the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, create uncertainty in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Thus, we cannot predict the impact of the Legislation on our future reimbursement at this time and we can provide no assurance that the Legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The Legislation amends several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	While Congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found in violation of such law, the Legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Legislation also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The impact of the Legislation on each of our hospitals may vary.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Because Legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years, we anticipate that many of the provisions in the Legislation may be subject to further revision.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We cannot predict the impact the Legislation may have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity, or whether we will be able to successfully adapt to the changes required by the Legislation.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In accordance with our internal policies and procedures, as well as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical treatment (whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition, we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient s medical condition, within the facility s capability, or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital s written procedures.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Our obligations under EMTALA may increase substantially going forward; CMS has sought stakeholder comments concerning the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively, but has yet to issue further guidance in response to that request.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P26_S7	If the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly, or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under EMTALA is proposed and adopted, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P26_S8	If we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price, patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In recent years, the number of quality measures that hospitals are required to report publicly has increased.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	CMS publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the Medicare program.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Additionally, the Legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish, update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If any of our hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys (or results that are lower than our competitors) or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volume could decline because patients may elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	This circumstance could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P28_S4	An increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Collection of receivables from third-party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and deductibles.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	certain state-based funding programs, most particularly Illinois and Texas as discussed herein.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables, historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Significant changes in business office operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P30_S5	The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals, and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	As a result, most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	As a result, the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals, and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	They may terminate their affiliation with us at any time.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P33_S4	If we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P33_S5	It may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals are located.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Generally, the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P33_S8	The loss of one or more of these physicians, even if temporary, could cause a material reduction in our revenues, which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment, our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The technology used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and, as a result, manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	To compete effectively, we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry, patients may seek treatment from other providers and/or physicians may refer their patients to alternate sources, which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	If we fail to continue to meet the meaningful use criteria related to electronic health record systems ( EHR ), our operations could be harmed.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Pursuant to HITECH regulations, hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S5	We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S6	However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S7	Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S8	Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S9	We depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S10	We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S11	The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S12	This shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S13	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S14	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets, which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S15	We cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S16	If our general labor and related expenses increase, we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S17	Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S18	Increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S19	Union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future, to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionized, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P35_S20	If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	confidentiality, maintenance, privacy and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our facilities; operating policies and procedures, and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Among these laws are the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, ( HIPAA ), the federal anti-kickback statute and the provision of the Social Security Act commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	These laws, and particularly the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	A number of our current arrangements, including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	CMS published a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol, which is intended to allow providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark law.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the Stark law, there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the Stark Law or that self-disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Federal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that require us to implement and, in the future, may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient s health and related financial information.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Such privacy and security regulations impose extensive administrative, physical and technical requirements on us, restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information, provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Additionally, recent changes to HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements, including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	These laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In the future, it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P39_S5	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws (see Item 3 Legal Proceedings ), or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P39_S6	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P39_S7	See Item 1 Business Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation .
352915_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We are subject to occupational health, safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Regulatory requirements affecting us include, but are not limited to, those covering: (i) air and water quality control; (ii) occupational health and safety (e.g., standards regarding blood-borne pathogens and ergonomics, etc.); (iii) waste management; (iv) the handling of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances; and (v) other hazardous materials.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S6	If we fail to comply with those standards, we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S7	We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S8	We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S9	Some of these actions may involve large claims, as well as significant defense costs.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S10	We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S11	In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may choose to negotiate a settlement.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P41_S12	Amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	All professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We believe that, based on our past experience and actuarial estimates, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	While we continuously monitor our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	We may be subject to governmental investigations, regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The federal False Claims Act permits private parties to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits against companies.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Legal Proceedings for disclosure of current related matters.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The failure of certain employers, or the closure of certain facilities, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The economies in the non-urban communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The failure of one or more large employer or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our hospitals operate, could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P47_S3	The occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations, thereby harming our business.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	If any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	All of our hospitals are deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S3	The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S5	However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Our growth strategy depends, in part, on acquisitions, and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S7	We may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not-for-profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S8	Acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S9	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit healthcare companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S10	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P49_S11	Also, suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	In addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that affect the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a healthcare facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation, increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals, increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria, any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital s results of operations, allocation of the purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S6	We may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire, which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S7	We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S8	We may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S9	Integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S10	In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by acquired hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S11	In addition, some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P50_S12	If we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire, operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals, our results of operations could be harmed.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility s reputation could harm our business.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions (see Item 3-Legal Proceedings ).
352915_15_ITEM1A_P51_S6	In addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P51_S7	Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our legal proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity following the merger and our ability to achieve expected benefits of the merger.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P51_S8	In particular, government investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to material fines, penalties, damages payments or other sanctions, including exclusion from government healthcare programs.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P51_S9	Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted Certificates of Need, or CON, laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization review, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors, including physicians clinical decisions and availability, payor programs shifting to a more outpatient-based environment, whether or not certain services are offered, seasonal and severe weather conditions, including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornados, earthquakes, current local economic and demographic changes.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	In addition, technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P55_S3	A worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Our patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance, which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P55_S5	Worsening of economic conditions may result in a higher unemployment rate which may increase the number of individuals without health insurance.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P55_S6	As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or an increase in services provided to uninsured patients.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P55_S7	These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P55_S8	In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $3.29 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P55_S9	Should the revenues and financial results of our acute care and/or behavioral health care facilities be materially, unfavorably impacted due to, among other things, a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates, a continued rise in the unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P55_S10	Fluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	If we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future, the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In addition to our operating results, many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P56_S4	These factors include certain of the risks discussed herein, demographic changes, operating results of other hospital companies, changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts, speculation in the press or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, managed care contract negotiations and terminations, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We are exposed to currency exchange risk with respect to the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Pound sterling, because a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in Pounds.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	We monitor changes in our exposure to exchange rate risk.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P57_S3	While we may elect to enter into hedging arrangements to protect our business against certain currency fluctuations, these hedging arrangements do not provide comprehensive protection, and our results of operations could be adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P58_S2	While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P58_S3	For example, we cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P58_S4	We also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P58_S5	If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P58_S6	If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P58_S7	A cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of member privacy, or other negative impacts.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We rely extensively on our information technology ( IT ) systems to manage clinical and financial data, communicate with our patients, payors, vendors and other third parties and summarize and analyze operating results.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize electronic health records and to become meaningful users of health information technology pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	A cyber-attack that bypasses our IT security systems causing an IT security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws, loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption of our IT business systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of public health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Generally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P60_S5	Differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P62_S1	As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	We require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P63_S3	We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	To fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P65_S3	We depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P65_S4	The expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P65_S5	The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities, which could harm our business.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	At December 31, 2014, 23.3 million shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P66_S3	To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the current holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P66_S4	In addition, from time-to-time our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P66_S5	Such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P66_S6	Conversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P66_S7	Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The right to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P67_S2	As of March 24, 2014, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 7.4% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect five members of the Board of Directors and constituted 86.7% of our general voting power.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P67_S3	As of March 24, 2014, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options) constituted 92.6% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 13.3% of our general voting power.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P67_S4	As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P67_S5	Each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).
352915_15_ITEM1A_P67_S6	In the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock, which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P67_S7	The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P67_S8	Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his family who are also directors and officers of our company, and they can elect a majority of our company s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.
352915_15_ITEM1A_P67_S9	In addition, because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.

352915_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	We have the right to repay borrowings upon short notice and without penalty, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, demand note and accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	Also includes the impact of various interest rate swap and cap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2014, as calculated to maturity dates utilizing the applicable floating interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2014.

352915_15_ITEM2_P3_S2	In addition to this new hospital project, we had various other projects under construction as of December 31, 2014 with estimated additional cost to complete and equip of approximately $155 million.
352915_15_ITEM2_P3_S3	Because we can terminate substantially all of the related construction contracts at any time without paying a termination fee, these costs are excluded from the above table except for the amount contractually committed to a third-party.
352915_15_ITEM2_P4_S0	(d) Consists of: (i) $87 million related to long-term contracts with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing services for our acute care facilities; (ii) $116 million related to the future expected costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the on-going operation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities, and; (iii) a $2 million liability for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future.
352915_15_ITEM2_P5_S0	(e) Reflects our future minimum operating lease payment obligations related to our operating lease agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2014 as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
352915_15_ITEM2_P5_S1	Some of the lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease and our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options.

352915_15_ITEM2_P7_S2	We exclude the $193 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments.
352915_15_ITEM2_P7_S3	Please see Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.

352915_15_ITEM2_P8_S1	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.
352915_15_ITEM2_P9_S0	In connection with a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the PSI acquisition, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_15_ITEM2_P10_S0	put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_15_ITEM2_P10_S1	We exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these minority ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertainty as to: (i) whether or not the put rights, if exercisable, will actually be exercised; (ii) the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were exercised, and; (iii) the timing of such payments.
352915_15_ITEM2_P10_S2	Additionally, the table above does not include $2 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM2_P11_S0	Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be utilized.

352915_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICDs ) from 2003 to 2010 at several of our acute care facilities.
352915_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Coverage Determination regarding these devices.
352915_15_ITEM3_P1_S2	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	In February, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and several UHS owned behavioral health facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a, The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_15_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_15_ITEM3_P2_S2	Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013.
352915_15_ITEM3_P2_S3	We were advised that a qui tam action had been filed against Roxbury Treatment Center but the government declined to intervene and the case was dismissed.
352915_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various documents from January, 2005 to the date of the subpoenas.
352915_15_ITEM3_P3_S1	In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records.
352915_15_ITEM3_P3_S2	In October, 2013, we were advised by the DOJ s Criminal Frauds Section that they received a referral from the DOJ Civil Division and opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center.
352915_15_ITEM3_P3_S3	Subsequent subpoenas have since been issued to River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center requesting additional documentation.
352915_15_ITEM3_P4_S0	In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal regulations which implemented provisions of the Affordable Care Act regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations.
352915_15_ITEM3_P4_S1	The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility.
352915_15_ITEM3_P4_S2	River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension.
352915_15_ITEM3_P4_S3	In response, CMS has continued the payment suspension.
352915_15_ITEM3_P4_S4	River Point Behavioral Health has provided additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect.
352915_15_ITEM3_P4_S5	In August 2014, we received notification from CMS that, effective September, 2014, the payment suspension was to be continued for another 180 days.
352915_15_ITEM3_P4_S6	We cannot predict if and/or when the facility s suspended payments will resume.
352915_15_ITEM3_P5_S0	continued for a significant period of time, the payment suspension will likely have a material adverse effect on River Point Behavioral Health s future results of operations and financial condition.
352915_15_ITEM3_P6_S0	The operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013.
352915_15_ITEM3_P7_S0	In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_15_ITEM3_P7_S1	In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy.
352915_15_ITEM3_P8_S0	In March, 2014, a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) was served on the National Deaf Academy requesting documents and information from the facility from January 1, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_15_ITEM3_P8_S1	We have been advised by the government that the National Deaf Academy has been added to the facilities which are the subject of the coordinated investigation referenced above.
352915_15_ITEM3_P9_S0	In March, 2014, CIDs were served on Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Streamwood Behavioral Health requesting documents and information from those facilities from January, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_15_ITEM3_P9_S1	In September, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division advised us that they were expanding their investigation to include four additional facilities and were requesting production of documents from these facilities.
352915_15_ITEM3_P9_S2	These facilities are Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons by the Sea, and Turning Point Care Center.
352915_15_ITEM3_P10_S0	In December 2014, the DOJ Civil Division requested that Salt Lake Behavioral Health produce documents responsive to the original subpoenas issued in February, 2013.
352915_15_ITEM3_P10_S1	The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation in connection with the behavioral health facilities named above is a False Claim Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities.
352915_15_ITEM3_P10_S2	At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure of the Company and/or named facilities, if any, in connection with these matters.
352915_15_ITEM3_P10_S3	Matters Relating to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ): The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of PSI) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010: Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_15_ITEM3_P11_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_15_ITEM3_P11_S1	The requested documents were collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_15_ITEM3_P11_S2	Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July, 2011 requesting additional documents, which have also been delivered to the DOJ.
352915_15_ITEM3_P11_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_15_ITEM3_P11_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_15_ITEM3_P12_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_15_ITEM3_P12_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_15_ITEM3_P12_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ.
352915_15_ITEM3_P12_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_15_ITEM3_P12_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_15_ITEM3_P13_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse.
352915_15_ITEM3_P13_S1	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
352915_15_ITEM3_P13_S2	Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_15_ITEM3_P13_S3	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to payment suspension, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_15_ITEM3_P14_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_15_ITEM3_P14_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_15_ITEM3_P14_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein.
352915_15_ITEM3_P14_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_15_ITEM3_P14_S4	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_15_ITEM3_P14_S5	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_15_ITEM3_P14_S6	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_15_ITEM3_P14_S7	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.
352915_15_ITEM3_P14_S8	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_15_ITEM3_P14_S9	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

352915_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors You should carefully review the information contained in this Annual Report, and should particularly consider any risk factors that we set forth in this Annual Report and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	In this Annual Report, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance.
352915_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, and statements of our goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.
352915_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Words such as may, will, should, could, would, predicts, potential, continue, expects, anticipates, future, intends, plans, believes, estimates, appears, projects and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	In evaluating those statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks related to healthcare industry trends and those set forth herein in Item 1A. Risk Factors .
352915_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved.
352915_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	Such factors include, among other things, the following:
352915_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level.
352915_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters as disclosed in Item 3.
352915_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	as discussed below in Sources of Revenue , we receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate, (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Nevada, Virginia and Florida); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois, Mississippi, Arkansas and California, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina.
352915_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	in March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	The two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade.
352915_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.
352915_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the Joint Committee ), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (approximately $35 million annual reduction to our Medicare net revenues effective as of April 1, 2013) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 include amounts due from Illinois of approximately $44 million and $49 million, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures.
352915_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Approximately $23 million as of December 31, 2014 and $28 million as of December 31, 2013, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date.
352915_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	In addition, our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 includes approximately $102 million and $62 million due from Texas in connection with Medicaid supplemental payment programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P14_S4	The $102 million due from Texas as of December 31, 2014 consists of $45 million related to uncompensated care program revenues, $33 million related to disproportionate share hospital program revenues and $24 million related to Delivery Service Reform Incentive Payment program ( DSRIP ) revenues.
352915_15_ITEM7_P14_S5	Approximately $24 million of cash was received in January, 2015 from Texas related to the above-mentioned DSRIP receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P14_S6	Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois and Texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P14_S7	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois and/or Texas.
352915_15_ITEM7_P14_S8	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
352915_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	CMS deferred the federal matching funds on Texas Medicaid uncompensated care payments made to providers in certain counties in Texas.
352915_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Although our hospitals located in Texas were not impacted by this deferral since they are not located in the impacted geographical areas, we can provide no assurance that our hospitals will not be impacted by future deferrals if CMS expands the deferrals to other counties in Texas.
352915_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	there have been several attempts in Congress to repeal or modify various provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	We cannot predict whether or not any of these proposed changes to the PPACA will become law and therefore can provide no assurance that changes to the PPACA, as currently implemented, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	In addition, a case currently pending before The Supreme Court of the United States, King vs. Burwell , challenges the federal government s ability to subsidize premiums paid by certain eligible individuals that obtain health insurance policies through federally facilitated exchanges.
352915_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	A number of our hospitals operate in states that utilize federally facilitated exchanges.
352915_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

352915_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
352915_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in Note 1 to the financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following: Revenue Recognition:
352915_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 36% of our net patient revenues during 2014, 38% during 2013 and 39% during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 50% of our net patient revenues during 2014 and 49% during each of 2013 and 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_15_ITEM7_P22_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_15_ITEM7_P22_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2014, 2013 and 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of December 31, 2014, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.
352915_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_15_ITEM7_P27_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_15_ITEM7_P27_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_15_ITEM7_P27_S6	Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_15_ITEM7_P27_S7	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_15_ITEM7_P27_S8	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_15_ITEM7_P27_S9	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_15_ITEM7_P27_S10	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	such as county indigent programs in certain states.
352915_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration.
352915_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned.
352915_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered.
352915_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible.
352915_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient s Medicaid eligibility.
352915_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	When the patient s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending.
352915_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	Although the patient s ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2014, 2013 or 2012 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
352915_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in uninsured discounts amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable.
352915_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Effective January 1, 2014, in response to market conditions and other considerations, we modified our uninsured discount policy and increased the discount to 60% of gross charges from 30% previously.
352915_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	Since we expect to collect only a small portion of amounts due from our uninsured patients, the increase in the uninsured discount in 2014 had no material impact on our net revenues, net income attributable to UHS or net accounts receivable, as compared to prior year periods.
352915_15_ITEM7_P33_S4	However, this change resulted in an increase in uninsured discounts and a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts.
352915_15_ITEM7_P33_S5	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $325 million and $395 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM7_P33_S6	Approximately 84% during 2014 and 90% during 2013 of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our acute care hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM7_P33_S7	Shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of December 31, 2014 and 2013:
352915_15_ITEM7_P33_S8	As of December 31, 2014: As of December 31, 2013:
352915_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
352915_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	The regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
352915_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Medicare EHR incentive payments: Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Medicaid EHR incentive payments: Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria.
352915_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria.
352915_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	Upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods.
352915_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria were included in other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_15_ITEM7_P37_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_15_ITEM7_P37_S5	In addition, we also: (i) own a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada, and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_15_ITEM7_P37_S6	The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_15_ITEM7_P37_S7	Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability: Effective November, 2010, excluding certain subsidiaries acquired since 2010 as discussed below, the vast majority of our subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million and $3 million per occurrence, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Since our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence.
352915_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	The nine behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation ( Ascend ) in October, 2012 have general and professional liability policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to $12 million of aggregate coverage, subject to a $100,000 per occurrence deductible.
352915_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	The 17 facilities acquired from Cygnet Health Care Limited ( Cygnet ), consisting of 15 inpatient behavioral health hospitals and 2 nursing homes, have policies through a commercial insurance carrier located in the United Kingdom that provides for 10 million of professional liability coverage and 25 million of general liability coverage.
352915_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	The facilities acquired from PSI, Ascend and Cygnet, like our other facilities, are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations, as mentioned above.
352915_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $193 million, of which $51 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $206 million, of which $44 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P40_S5	We recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $20 million during 2014, $81 million during 2013 and $27 million during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P40_S6	The favorable changes recorded during 2014 and 2012 resulted from changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis.
352915_15_ITEM7_P40_S7	The favorable change in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2013, relating to years prior to 2013, were due primarily to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 100% from 75%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 0% from 25%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years.
352915_15_ITEM7_P40_S8	As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends.
352915_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $67 million, of which $32 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $64 million, of which $34 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	During the last three years, adjustments recorded to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	Although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for self-insured general and professional and workers compensation claims, given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves, as discussed above, it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves.
352915_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and workers compensation reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2014 (amount in thousands):
352915_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	(a) General and professional liability amounts are net of adjustments recorded during each year, as discussed above.
352915_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	We have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a $250,000 deductible for the majority of our properties (the properties acquired from PSI are subject to a $50,000 deductible).
352915_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented fault zones.
352915_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_15_ITEM7_P44_S5	The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million, subject to a $25,000 deductible.
352915_15_ITEM7_P44_S6	Non-critical flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.
352915_15_ITEM7_P44_S7	Since certain of our facilities have been designated by our insurer as flood prone, we have elected to purchase policies from The National Flood Insurance Program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible.
352915_15_ITEM7_P44_S8	Property insurance for the facilities acquired from Cygnet are provided on an all risk basis up to a 180 million limit that includes coverage for real and personal property as well as business interruption losses.
352915_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_15_ITEM7_P45_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	We have designated September 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2014 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	There were also no impairments during 2013 or 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	See Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates below for discussion of our effective tax rates during each of the last three years.
352915_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements: For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements, please see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Accounting Standards as included in this Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.

352915_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Net revenues increased 11% or $782 million to $8.07 billion during 2014 as compared to $7.28 billion during 2013.
352915_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase was primarily attributable to:
352915_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	other combined net increase of $225 million consisting primarily of the net revenues generated during 2014 related to acquisitions made during the year including: (i) a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada; (ii) the 17 behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom acquired as part of our acquisition of Cygnet Health Care Limited, and; (iii) a 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center located in Washington, D.C.

352915_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Net income attributable to UHS increased $35 million to $545 million during 2014 as compared to $511 million during 2013.
352915_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	a decrease of $9 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from: (i) the income tax provision on the $44 million increase in pre-tax income ($60 million increase in income before income taxes less the $16 million decrease in income resulting from an increase in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests), partially offset by; (ii) the income tax provision recorded during 2013 on the sale of Peak Behavioral Health Services (the tax basis gain realized on the sale in 2013 exceeded the gain recorded pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles), and; (iii) a decrease during 2014, as compared to 2013, to our blended effective state income tax rate.
352915_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012:
352915_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Net revenues increased 5% or $322 million to $7.28 billion during 2013 as compared to $6.96 billion during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	The increase was primarily attributable to:
352915_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	other combined net increase of $83 million consisting primarily of the net revenues generated during the first ten months of 2013 at nine behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012 (the operating results for these facilities for the months of November and December of 2013 and 2012 are included in our behavioral health care facilities-same facility basis results).
352915_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $106 million to $869 million during 2013 as compared to $764 million during 2012.

352915_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Acute Care Hospital Services Year Ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013:
352915_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	We believe that providing our results on a Same Facility basis, which includes the operating results for facilities owned in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance.
352915_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	Our Same Facility results also neutralize the impact of the EHR applications and the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.

352915_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	The increased income before income taxes experienced at our acute care facilities during 2014, as compared to 2013, was due in part to improving general economic conditions as well as a decrease in the number of uninsured patients treated at our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM7_P64_S3	The decrease in the number of uninsured patients treated at our acute care hospitals was due primarily to the favorable impact of the Affordable Care Act which includes the expansion of Medicaid in certain states in which we operate and the enrollment of patients in newly created commercial exchanges.
352915_15_ITEM7_P64_S4	Inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 0.6% during 2014, as compared to 2013, while patient days increased 3.9%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P64_S5	Adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 3.1% and adjusted patient days increased 6.5% during 2014, as compared to 2013.

352915_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:
352915_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	The provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals decreased to approximately $590 million during 2014 as compared to $1.02 billion during 2013.
352915_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	The decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts during 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to the increase in the uninsured discount (effective January 1, 2014, as discussed above in Charity Care, Uninsured discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts) , and reclassifications among provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending based upon our patients ultimate eligibility determination, as discussed above.
352915_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012:

352915_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	The increase in net revenues was attributable to:
352915_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	$25 million of other combined decreases resulting primarily from the divestiture, closure or operational wind-down of certain non-strategic behavioral health facilities/schools.
352915_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	Income before income taxes increased $57 million or 7% to $896 million or 24.4% of net revenues during 2013, as compared to $839 million or 24.2% of net revenues during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P80_S2	The increase in income before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to:
352915_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	a $21 million of other combined net increases, including the income generated at the nine facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Sources of Revenue Overview: We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services.
352915_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital.
352915_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.
352915_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis.
352915_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.
352915_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage.
352915_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year.
352915_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue.
352915_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts.
352915_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	The following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years (excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements) for: (i) our Acute Care and Behavioral Health Care Facilities Combined; (ii) our Acute Care Facilities, and; (iii) our Behavioral Health Care Facilities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.
352915_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease.
352915_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_15_ITEM7_P88_S3	Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.
352915_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge.
352915_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s Medicare severity diagnosis related group ( MS-DRG ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P89_S3	Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis.
352915_15_ITEM7_P89_S4	The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care.
352915_15_ITEM7_P89_S5	This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG.
352915_15_ITEM7_P89_S6	The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity.
352915_15_ITEM7_P89_S7	While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patient s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.
352915_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1.
352915_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the hospital market basket index, gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services.
352915_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM7_P90_S3	In August, 2014, CMS published its IPPS 2015 payment rule which provides for a 2.9% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 0.6%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	Including the estimated decreases to our DSH payments ( 1.9%) and Medicare Outlier threshold ( 0.6%), we estimate our overall decrease from the IPPS 2015 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015) will approximate ( 1.9%), or approximately $13 million annually.
352915_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	This projected impact from the IPPS 2015 rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.
352915_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	In August, 2013, CMS published its final IPPS 2014 payment rule which provides for a 2.5% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2014 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014) approximated 1.0%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	This projected impact from the IPPS 2014 final rule includes both the impact of the ATRA of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.
352915_15_ITEM7_P92_S3	The final rule also expands CMS s policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard.
352915_15_ITEM7_P92_S4	Specifically, it would require Medicare s external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services for at least two midnights (the Two Midnight rule).
352915_15_ITEM7_P92_S5	Correspondingly, under the final rule, CMS presumes that hospital services spanning less than two midnights should have been provided on an outpatient basis and paid under Medicare Part B unless the medical record contains clear documentation supporting the physician s order and an expectation that the Medicare beneficiary would need medically necessary care for more than two midnights, or is receiving services which CMS designates as inpatient only.
352915_15_ITEM7_P92_S6	Our acute care hospitals have begun to comply with the Two Midnight rule and, although we are unable to determine the ultimate impact at this time, its application could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P92_S7	Excluding the potential impact of the Two Midnight rule, we do not expect the final IPPS 2014 payment rule to have a material impact on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	In February, 2014, CMS extended by an additional six months a policy under which Recovery Auditor Contractors and other Medicare review contractors will not conduct post-payment patient status reviews of inpatient hospital claims with dates of admission on or after October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	Due to the continued delay in awarding contracts to new Recovery Audit Contractors, beginning in August, 2014, CMS initiated modifications to the current Recovery Auditor Contractor agreements to allow the restart of some reviews.
352915_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	In August, 2012, CMS published its final IPPS 2013 payment rule which provided for a 2.6% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2013 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013) approximated 1.8%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	The impact from the IPPS 2013 final rule reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph, however, it excludes the impact of potential reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.
352915_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_15_ITEM7_P95_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_15_ITEM7_P95_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (approximately $35 million annual reduction to our Medicare net revenues effective as of April 1, 2013) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	On January 2, 2013 ATRA was enacted which, among other things, includes a requirement for CMS to recoup $11 billion from hospitals from Medicare IPPS rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017.
352915_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	The recoupment relates to IPPS documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by CMS.
352915_15_ITEM7_P96_S2	Both the 2014 and 2015 IPPS final rules include a -0.8% recoupment adjustment.
352915_15_ITEM7_P96_S3	CMS expects to make similar adjustments in federal fiscal years 2016 and 2017 in order to recover the entire $11 billion.
352915_15_ITEM7_P96_S4	This adjustment is reflected in the 2014 and 2015 IPPS estimated impact amounts noted above.
352915_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	On January 1, 2005, CMS implemented a new Psychiatric Prospective Payment System ( Psych PPS ) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program.
352915_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	This system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics.
352915_15_ITEM7_P97_S2	The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department.
352915_15_ITEM7_P97_S3	In August, 2012, CMS published its final Psych PPS rate notice for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P97_S4	That final notice contained a Psych PPS market basket update of 2.7%, which was reduced by 0.7% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and reduced by 0.1% to reflect an other adjustment required by the Social Security Act for rate years 2010 through 2019.
352915_15_ITEM7_P97_S5	In July, 2013, CMS released its final Psych PPS rate notice for the federal fiscal year 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P97_S6	The final notice contains a Psych PPS market basket update of 2.6% which is reduced by 0.5% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and reduced by 0.1% to reflect an other adjustment required by the Social Security Act.
352915_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	On July 31, 2014, CMS published it Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 2.1% compared to federal fiscal year 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	This amount includes the effect of the 2.9% market basket update adjusted by the Affordable Care Act required 0.3% reduction and the -0.5% productivity adjustment.
352915_15_ITEM7_P98_S3	The final rule also updates the Inpatient Psychiatric Quality Reporting Program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update.
352915_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	In October, 2014, CMS published its Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System ( OPPS ) final rule for 2015.
352915_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	The proposed hospital market basket increase is 2.9%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P99_S2	The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2015 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2015 OPPS market basket update at 2.2%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P99_S3	In the final rule, CMS will reduce the 2015 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P99_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS for 2015 will aggregate to a net increase of 0.2%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P99_S5	Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2015 is estimated to be 1.5%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	In December, 2013, CMS published its annual final OPPS rule for 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	The final hospital market basket increase is 2.5%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P100_S2	The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.3% reduction to the 2014 OPPS market basket reducing the final 2014 OPPS market basket update to 1.7%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P100_S3	In the final rule, CMS reduced the 2014 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P100_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS for 2014 will aggregate to a net increase of 1.4%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P100_S5	Excluding the behavioral health partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2014 is estimated to be 2.5%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	In November, 2012, CMS published its annual final Medicare OPPS rule for 2013.
352915_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	The market basket increase to the OPPS base rate is 2.6%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	In addition, as outlined in the Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform discussion below, CMS was also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 0.1% in federal fiscal year 2013 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 0.7%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P101_S3	In the final rule, CMS implemented a significant increase in the 2013 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2013 is estimated to be 3.5%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2013 was approximately 1.7%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care.
352915_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM7_P103_S2	Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_15_ITEM7_P103_S3	In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid.
352915_15_ITEM7_P103_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P103_S5	We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Nevada, Virginia and Florida, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_15_ITEM7_P103_S6	Based upon the state budgets for those states for the 2015 fiscal year (which generally began at various times during the second half of 2014), we estimate that, on a blended basis, our aggregate Medicaid rates were relatively unchanged from the 2014 fiscal year rates.
352915_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	The Affordable Care Act substantially increases the federally and state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	However, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of the Affordable Care Act requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding.
352915_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that states in which we operate will expand Medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level.
352915_15_ITEM7_P104_S3	Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments, as discussed below.
352915_15_ITEM7_P104_S4	We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	Texas Uncompensated Care/Upper Payment Limit Payments:
352915_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hidalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in Medicaid supplemental payment Section 1115 Waiver indigent care programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	Section 1115 Waiver Uncompensated Care ( UC ) payments replace the former Upper Payment Limit ( UPL ) payments.
352915_15_ITEM7_P106_S2	These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties.
352915_15_ITEM7_P106_S3	Our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM7_P106_S4	The supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer ( IGT ) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM7_P106_S5	However, the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any IGT on the amount of any private hospital s indigent care obligation.
352915_15_ITEM7_P106_S6	We recorded net revenues/benefit from UPL and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of $68 million during 2014, $61 million during 2013 and $25 million during 2012, net of provider taxes (of $17 million in 2014, $10 million in 2013 and $0 in 2012).
352915_15_ITEM7_P106_S7	If the applicable hospital district or county makes IGTs consistent with 2014 levels, and without giving effect to potential reductions resulting from the February, 2015, THHSC proposed rule, which is discussed below, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net revenues/benefit earned pursuant to these programs of approximately $58 million during 2015, net of provider taxes (of $11 million).
352915_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	On February 6, 2015, THHSC published a proposed rule that would shift $136 million in funding from the private hospital UC pool to the large public hospital UC pool for the 2014 UC program year only.
352915_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	THHSC has not provided an estimated impact from this proposed shift due to the fact that certain UC data elements are not yet available.
352915_15_ITEM7_P107_S2	As such, we are unable to estimate the impact of this proposed rule change.
352915_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	On September 30, 2014, CMS notified the Texas Health and Human Services Commission that it was deferring the federal matching funds (approximately $75 million) on Texas Medicaid UC payments made to providers in certain counties.
352915_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	A deferral results in CMS withholding funds from the state representing the federal portion of Medicaid payments the state has previously made to providers.
352915_15_ITEM7_P108_S2	A deferral goes into effect when CMS questions the basis for all or part of the amount of Medicaid payments made to certain providers, and remains in place subject to CMS s final determination.
352915_15_ITEM7_P108_S3	Our Texas hospitals are not located in the geographic areas impacted by this deferral.
352915_15_ITEM7_P108_S4	On January 7, 2015, CMS removed the aforementioned deferral but indicated they will continue their review and assessment of the underlying UC financing arrangements as to ensure their compliance with the applicable federal regulations and eligibility for federal matching dollars.
352915_15_ITEM7_P108_S5	For state fiscal year 2015, Texas Medicaid will continue to operate under a CMS-approved Section 1115 five-year Medicaid waiver demonstration program.
352915_15_ITEM7_P108_S6	During the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission ( THHSC ) transitioned away from UPL payments to new waiver incentive payment programs, UC payments and Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments ( DSRIP ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P108_S7	During the first year of transition, which commenced on October 1, 2011, THHSC made payments to Medicaid UPL recipient providers that received payments during the state s prior fiscal year.
352915_15_ITEM7_P108_S8	During demonstration years two through five (October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2016), THHSC has, and will continue to, make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM7_P108_S9	Supplemental payments are also subject to an aggregate statewide caps based on CMS approved Medicaid waiver amounts.
352915_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments: In addition, the Texas Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver includes a DSRIP pool to incentivize hospitals and other providers to transform their service delivery practices to improve quality, health status, patient experience, coordination, and cost-effectiveness.
352915_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	DSRIP pool payments are incentive payments to hospitals and other providers that develop programs or strategies to enhance access to health care, increase the quality of care, the cost-effectiveness of care provided and the health of the patients and families served.
352915_15_ITEM7_P109_S2	In May, 2014, CMS formally approved specific DSRIP projects for certain of our hospitals for demonstration years 3 to 5 (our facilities did not materially participate in the DSRIP pool during demonstration years 1 or 2).
352915_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	DSRIP payments are contingent on the hospital meeting certain pre-determined milestones, metrics and clinical outcomes.
352915_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	Additionally, DSRIP payments are contingent on a governmental entity providing an IGT for the non-federal share component of the DSRIP payment.
352915_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	THHSC generally approves DSRIP reported metrics, milestones and clinical outcomes on a semi-annual basis in June and December.
352915_15_ITEM7_P111_S1	In connection with the DSRIP program and THHSC s approval for specific programs at certain of our hospitals and availability of a governmental IGT, we recorded approximately $17 million of net revenues/benefit during 2014 applicable to the period of October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014, net of provider taxes (of $8 million).
352915_15_ITEM7_P111_S2	Although we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for additional DSRIP revenues, subject to CMS s approval and other conditions as outlined above, we estimate that we may be entitled to additional DSRIP net revenues/benefit of approximately $25 million during 2015, net of provider taxes (of $15 million).
352915_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	Texas and South Carolina Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital ( DSH ) adjustment.
352915_15_ITEM7_P112_S1	Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments.
352915_15_ITEM7_P112_S2	Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.
352915_15_ITEM7_P112_S3	Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas and South Carolina s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state s DSH fund.
352915_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	In September, 2013, the THHSC published its 2013 final DSH rule that included changes that resulted in approximately $9 million of additional reimbursements to our acute care facilities located in Texas applicable to the state s 2013 fiscal year (which were included in our 2013 pre-tax consolidated financial results).
352915_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $49 million during 2014, $54 million during 2013 and $47 million during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P113_S2	Assuming that the Texas and South Carolina programs are renewed for each state s 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, at amounts similar to the 2014 fiscal year estimates, we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be approximately $49 million during 2015.
352915_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	The Affordable Care Act provides for a significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2016 (see below in Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid Revisions for additional disclosure).
352915_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology.
352915_15_ITEM7_P115_S1	As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in Texas and South Carolina, will likely be reduced in the coming years.
352915_15_ITEM7_P115_S2	Based on the September, 2013 CMS final rule, our Medicaid DSH payments in Texas and South Carolina could be reduced by approximately 4% in the 2016 federal fiscal year.
352915_15_ITEM7_P115_S3	This statutorily required reduction was originally scheduled to be implemented in federal fiscal year 2014 but was delayed to FFY 2017 by subsequent federal legislation.
352915_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	In May, 2013 the state of Texas enacted legislation that would increase the state s contribution of the non-federal DSH share for the 2013 DSH year to $138 million as compared to the $100 million previously expected.
352915_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	Similarly, the state s approved 2014-2015 General Appropriations bill ( Rider 86 ) passed in May, 2013 authorized $160 million for 2014 and $140 million for 2015, respectively, for the non-federal DSH share.
352915_15_ITEM7_P116_S2	Furthermore, in June, 2014, THHSC proposed certain changes to DSH reimbursement methodology as a result of Rider 86.
352915_15_ITEM7_P116_S3	We expect the 2015 DSH year amounts, to be comparable to the 2014 DSH year amounts.
352915_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	Various Other State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs: We incur health-care related taxes ( Provider Taxes ) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items of services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services.
352915_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments.
352915_15_ITEM7_P118_S1	Including the impact of the programs in various states applicable to each year, and excluding the impact of various programs in Texas, as discussed above, and the Nevada SPA, as discussed below, we earned an aggregate net revenues/benefit from Medicaid supplemental payments of approximately $71 million during 2014, $69 million during 2013 and $58 million during 2012 (of which $12 million related to 2011), net of Provider Taxes (of $112 million in 2014, $74 million in 2013 and $93 million in 2012).
352915_15_ITEM7_P118_S2	We estimate that our aggregate net revenues/benefit from Provider Tax programs will approximate $70 million during 2015, net of Provider Taxes (of $111 million).
352915_15_ITEM7_P118_S3	These amounts include the impact of the CMS approved California provider tax and related Medicaid supplemental payment programs, which did not have a material impact on our operating results.
352915_15_ITEM7_P118_S4	The aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P118_S5	However, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	In Nevada, CMS approved a state plan amendment ( SPA ) in August, 2014 that implemented a hospital supplemental payment program retroactive to January 1, 2014 and effective to June 30, 2015.
352915_15_ITEM7_P119_S1	Included in our 2014 results of operations was approximately $10 million of net revenues earned in connection with this program.
352915_15_ITEM7_P119_S2	We estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $7 million during 2015.
352915_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	As outlined above, we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P120_S1	Failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental Medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	HITECH Act: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P121_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria.
352915_15_ITEM7_P122_S1	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P122_S2	State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate.
352915_15_ITEM7_P122_S3	Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria.
352915_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	The government s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.
352915_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	Pursuant to HITECH Act regulations, hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_15_ITEM7_P124_S1	We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_15_ITEM7_P124_S2	However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.
352915_15_ITEM7_P124_S3	Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P124_S4	Our 2014 consolidated results of operations includes an unfavorable pre-tax impact of approximately $8 million consisting of approximately $28 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $37 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.
352915_15_ITEM7_P124_S5	Our 2013 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pre-tax impact of approximately $19 million consisting of approximately $61 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $10 million of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses, approximately $33 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.
352915_15_ITEM7_P124_S6	Our 2012 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pre-tax impact of approximately $3 million consisting of approximately $30 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $15 million of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses, approximately $13 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.
352915_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P125_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P126_S1	In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow.
352915_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate.
352915_15_ITEM7_P127_S1	Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.
352915_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance.
352915_15_ITEM7_P128_S1	Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy.
352915_15_ITEM7_P128_S2	Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.
352915_15_ITEM7_P128_S3	Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services.
352915_15_ITEM7_P128_S4	To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage.
352915_15_ITEM7_P129_S1	Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy.
352915_15_ITEM7_P129_S2	Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.
352915_15_ITEM7_P129_S3	Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:
352915_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, the War on Terrorism, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, the expansion of a Medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future.
352915_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the Reconciliation Act ) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the Affordable Care Act ), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM7_P132_S1	Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.
352915_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	The Affordable Care Act implemented certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.
352915_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	A Medicare shared savings program, effective in 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	A hospital readmissions reduction program, effective in 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	A value-based purchasing program for hospitals, effective in 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	A national pilot program on payment bundling, effective in 2013.
352915_15_ITEM7_P138_S0	Reduction to Medicare disproportionate share hospital ( DSH ) payments, effective in 2014, as discussed above.
352915_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments, effective in 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P140_S0	The Affordable Care Act (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal DSH funding from federal fiscal year ( FFY ) 2017 through FFY 2024.
352915_15_ITEM7_P140_S1	The aggregate annual reduction amounts are: $1.8 billion for FFY 2017 $4.7 billion for FFY 2018 $4.7 billion for FFY 2019 $4.7 billion for FFY 2020 $4.8 billion for FFY 2021 $5.0 billion for FFY 2022 $5.0 billion for FFY 2023 $4.4 billion for FFY 2024 Health Insurance Revisions:
352915_15_ITEM7_P141_S0	Large employer insurance reforms, effective in 2015.
352915_15_ITEM7_P142_S0	Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies, effective in 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P143_S0	Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms, effective in 2010 and forward.
352915_15_ITEM7_P144_S0	The Affordable Care Act seeks to increase competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state insurance exchanges.
352915_15_ITEM7_P144_S1	The Affordable Care Act also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health status, gender, or other specified factors.
352915_15_ITEM7_P144_S2	We cannot provide assurance that these provisions will not adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for services provided to insured patients, or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward.
352915_15_ITEM7_P145_S0	Value-Based Purchasing: There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services.
352915_15_ITEM7_P145_S1	These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P146_S0	Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates.
352915_15_ITEM7_P146_S1	In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events.
352915_15_ITEM7_P146_S2	Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.
352915_15_ITEM7_P147_S0	The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing.
352915_15_ITEM7_P148_S0	The Affordable Care Act prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions ( HAC ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P148_S1	Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments.
352915_15_ITEM7_P148_S2	Hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.
352915_15_ITEM7_P148_S3	The Affordable Care Act also required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P149_S0	0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years.
352915_15_ITEM7_P149_S1	HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS.
352915_15_ITEM7_P149_S2	HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions.
352915_15_ITEM7_P149_S3	In its fiscal year 2015 IPPS final rule, CMS will fund the value-based purchasing program by reducing base operating DRG payment amounts to participating hospitals by 1.5%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P150_S0	In the Affordable Care Act, Congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program ( HRRP ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P150_S1	The HRRP assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates when compared to expected rates, effective for discharges beginning October 1, 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P150_S2	In the fiscal year 2013 IPPS final rule, CMS finalized certain policies with regard to payment under the HRRP, including which hospitals are subject to the HRRP, the methodology to calculate the hospital readmission payment adjustment factor, and what portion of the IPPS payment is used to calculate the readmission adjustment factor.
352915_15_ITEM7_P150_S3	In the fiscal year 2014 IPPS final rule, CMS finalized revisions to the three 30-day admission measures in the program heart failure, myocardial infarction, and pneumonia to exclude planned readmissions.
352915_15_ITEM7_P151_S0	Under the Affordable Care Act, beginning in fiscal year 2015, the maximum reduction in payments under the HRRP will increase from 2% to 3%.
352915_15_ITEM7_P151_S1	CMS will expand the program and add two readmission measures, one, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and, two, patients admitted for elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
352915_15_ITEM7_P151_S2	In the fiscal year 2015 IPPS final rule, CMS added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017.
352915_15_ITEM7_P152_S0	We do not believe impact of HRRP for federal fiscal year 2014 had or will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P153_S0	The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations ( ACOs ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P153_S1	The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services.
352915_15_ITEM7_P153_S2	The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency.
352915_15_ITEM7_P153_S3	ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.
352915_15_ITEM7_P154_S0	In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P154_S1	The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions.
352915_15_ITEM7_P154_S2	We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments.
352915_15_ITEM7_P154_S3	Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.
352915_15_ITEM7_P154_S4	Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_15_ITEM7_P154_S5	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM7_P154_S6	Other Operating Results Combined net revenues and income/losses before income taxes from our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2014, 2013 or 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P155_S0	Interest Expense Below is a schedule of our interest expense during 2014, 2013 and 2012 (amounts in thousands):
352915_15_ITEM7_P156_S0	As discussed below in Capital Resources-Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities , during the third quarter of 2014, we completed the following financing transactions:
352915_15_ITEM7_P157_S0	On August 7, 2014, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to our credit agreement dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended on March 15, 2011, September 21, 2012 and May 16, 2013, among UHS, as borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time parties thereto, as lenders ( Credit Agreement ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P158_S0	Increased the borrowing capacity on our existing $275 million accounts receivable securitization program ( Securitization ) to $360 million effective August 1, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P159_S0	As discussed below in Costs Related to Early Extinguishment of Debt , in connection with these financing transactions, our 2014 results of operations included a $36 million pre-tax charge incurred for the costs related to the extinguishment of debt.
352915_15_ITEM7_P160_S0	In September, 2012, we completed a second amendment to our credit agreement dated November, 15, 2010, as amended.
352915_15_ITEM7_P161_S0	subsequently combined into our new term loan A facility during the third quarter of 2014, as discussed above.
352915_15_ITEM7_P161_S1	In September, 2012, we used $700 million of the term loan A2 proceeds to repay our then outstanding, higher priced term loan B facility.
352915_15_ITEM7_P161_S2	The remainder of the term loan A2 proceeds was used to pay transaction-related fees and expenses and to repay other floating rate debt.
352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S0	In May, 2013 we completed a third amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended.
352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S1	The third amendment provided for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with certain borrowings outstanding at that time under the credit agreement.
352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S2	Specifically, we replaced our then outstanding $745.9 million senior secured term loan B with a new senior secured term loan B1 in the same amount on substantially the same terms as the term loan B, other than lower interest rates.
352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S3	Interest expense decreased $12 million during 2014 to $134 million as compared to $146 million during 2013.
352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S4	The decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $16 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program due primarily to a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings as well as a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities, as discussed below; (ii) a $6 million decrease in amortization and financing fees, resulting primarily from the write-off of certain deferred financing costs and original issue discounts in connection with the financing transactions during the third quarter of 2014, as discussed above, partially offset by; (iii) $5 million of capitalized interest recorded on major projects during 2013, and; (iv) a $5 million decrease in interest income, primarily related to the interest income received from Illinois during 2013 related to delayed cash remittances to us.
352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S5	The aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program were approximately $3.2 billion during 2014 and approximately $3.5 billion during 2013.
352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S6	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 2.9% during 2014 and 3.1% during 2013.
352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S7	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 3.9% during 2014 and 4.2% during 2013.
352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S8	Interest expense decreased $33 million during 2013 to $146 million as compared to $179 million during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S9	The decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $21 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program due primarily to a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities, as discussed below; (ii) a $5 million decrease in the amortization of financing fees, and; (iii) other combined net decrease of $7 million consisting primarily of interest earned by us on delayed cash remittances paid to us from Illinois.
352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S10	The aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program were approximately $3.5 billion during each of 2013 and 2012.

352915_15_ITEM7_P162_S14	This charge consisted of the write-off of deferred charges ($20 million) and original issue discount on the extinguished debt ($5 million) as well as the make-whole premium paid ($11 million) on the early redemption of the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes.

352915_15_ITEM7_P163_S2	Transaction Costs There were no material transaction fees incurred in 2014 or 2013.
352915_15_ITEM7_P163_S3	During 2012, we incurred approximately $6 million of transaction costs in connection with our acquisition of 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P163_S4	These costs consisted primarily of legal, investment banking and consulting fees.
352915_15_ITEM7_P164_S0	Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_15_ITEM7_P165_S0	Outside owners hold various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in seven of our acute care facilities and one behavioral health care facility.
352915_15_ITEM7_P165_S1	Each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies ( LLC ) or limited partnerships ( LP ).
352915_15_ITEM7_P165_S2	As a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit.
352915_15_ITEM7_P165_S3	When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members /partners share of the income generated by the joint-venture entities.
352915_15_ITEM7_P166_S0	In addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners.
352915_15_ITEM7_P166_S1	The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (dollar amounts in thousands): The impact of the discrete tax items did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes during 2014, 2013 or 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P167_S0	provision recorded during 2013 on the sale of Peak Behavioral Health Services which was divested in May, 2013 (the tax basis gain realized on the sale of Peak Behavioral Health Services exceeded the gain recorded pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles), and; (iii) a decrease to our federal income tax provision relating to 2013 that was recorded during 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P167_S1	We consider the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
352915_15_ITEM7_P167_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $12 million.
352915_15_ITEM7_P167_S3	Discontinued Operations There were no material divestitures during 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P168_S0	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services ( Peak ), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
352915_15_ITEM7_P168_S1	The divestiture of Peak was completed during the second quarter of 2013 for total cash proceeds of approximately $24 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million which is included in our 2013 consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P169_S0	In October of 2012, we completed the divestiture of Auburn Regional Medical Center ( Auburn ), a 159-bed acute care hospital located in Auburn, Washington, for total cash proceeds of approximately $93 million.
352915_15_ITEM7_P169_S1	This divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $26 million which was included in our 2012 consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM7_P169_S2	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities (which were divested during 2011) as well as one of our legacy behavioral health facilities in Puerto Rico, which we divested in 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7_P170_S0	The following table shows the results of operations for Auburn and Peak, on a combined basis, which were reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership for each of the years presented herein (amounts in thousands).
352915_15_ITEM7_P170_S1	Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.
352915_15_ITEM7_P171_S0	Effects of Inflation and Seasonality Seasonality Our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_15_ITEM7_P171_S1	This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.
352915_15_ITEM7_P172_S0	Inflation Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years.
352915_15_ITEM7_P173_S0	pressures, as are supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases.
352915_15_ITEM7_P173_S1	Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices.
352915_15_ITEM7_P173_S2	We believe, however, that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.

352915_15_ITEM7_P200_S2	Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) the issuance of equity; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement, and/or; (iii) the issuance of other long-term debt.
352915_15_ITEM7_P200_S3	We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our $800 million revolving credit facility and $360 million accounts receivable securitization program, as well as access to the capital markets, provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.
352915_15_ITEM7_P200_S4	However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_15_ITEM7_P200_S5	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
352915_15_ITEM7_P200_S6	As of December 31, 2014 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $94 million consisting of: (i) $73 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $21 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.
352915_15_ITEM7_P200_S7	Obligations under operating leases for real property, real property master leases and equipment amount to $335 million as of December 31, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7_P201_S0	The real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income.
352915_15_ITEM7_P201_S1	We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense.
352915_15_ITEM7_P201_S2	In addition, we lease three hospital facilities from the Trust with terms expiring in 2016.
352915_15_ITEM7_P201_S3	These leases contain up to three 5-year renewal options.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2014 and 2013 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	However, at December 31, 2014, each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P5_S3	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P5_S4	During 2011, we entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of $450 million from December, 2011 to December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December, 2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P5_S5	The three-month LIBOR never reached 7.00% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2013, and therefore no payment was made to us.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We also entered into six forward starting interest rate swaps in 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $425 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 1.91%.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $75 million, $25 million and $100 million became effective in December, 2011 and had corresponding fixed rates of 1.32%, 1.96% and 2.50%.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The $75 million, $25 million, and $100 million interest rate swaps matured in December, 2012, December, 2013, and December, 2014, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	During 2010, we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $600 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Each of the four swaps became effective in December, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we paid a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of $150 million and received three-month LIBOR.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Each of the two interest rate swaps, which are now expired, had an initial notional principal amount of $75 million.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The fixed rate payable on one of the interest rate swaps was 4.87% and it matured in October, 2011.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P8_S3	The fixed rate payable on the other interest rate swap, on which the notional principal amount reduced to $50 million in October, 2010, was 4.76% and it matured in October, 2012.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P9_S2	We consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $6 million at December 31, 2014, all of which is included in other current liabilities.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P10_S1	At December 31, 2013, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $24 million, of which $19 million was included in other current liabilities and $5 million was included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P11_S1	For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.
352915_15_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Ending December 31 (dollars in thousands) As calculated based upon our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014 that is subject to interest rate fluctuations, each 1% change in interest rates would impact our pre-tax income by approximately $14 million.
352915_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, together with the reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, are included elsewhere herein.

352915_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	December 31, 2014, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
352915_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the SEC rules thereunder.
352915_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the fourth quarter of 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
352915_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over our financial reporting.
352915_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria on Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
352915_15_ITEM9A_P2_S3	We have excluded the acquisitions made during 2014, including Cygnet Health Care Limited, Prominence Health Plan and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 because they were acquired by us in purchase business combinations at various times during 2014.
352915_15_ITEM9A_P2_S4	These facilities/businesses represented approximately 6% of our consolidated total assets and 2% of our consolidated net revenues as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Based on its assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the COSO.
352915_15_ITEM9A_P2_S6	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein.

352915_15_ITEM15_P13_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Health Services, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
352915_15_ITEM15_P13_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P13_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_15_ITEM15_P13_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, financial statement schedule, and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Item 9A as Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
352915_15_ITEM15_P13_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
352915_15_ITEM15_P13_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
352915_15_ITEM15_P13_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
352915_15_ITEM15_P13_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
352915_15_ITEM15_P13_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
352915_15_ITEM15_P13_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
352915_15_ITEM15_P13_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
352915_15_ITEM15_P14_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_15_ITEM15_P14_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P14_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P14_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
352915_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting , management has excluded Cygnet Health Care Limited, Prominence Health Plan, and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 because the entities were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2014.
352915_15_ITEM15_P15_S1	We have also excluded Cygnet Health Care Limited, Prominence Health Plan, and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.
352915_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	Cygnet Health Care Limited, Prominence Health Plan, and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total net revenues represent 6% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014.

352915_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1) BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Services provided by our hospitals, all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.
352915_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	We, through our subsidiaries, provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
352915_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	The more significant accounting policies follow: A) Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner.
352915_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
352915_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_15_ITEM15_P24_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 36% of our net patient revenues during 2014, 38% during 2013 and 39% during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P24_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 50% of our net patient revenues during 2014 and 49% during each of 2013 and 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P24_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_15_ITEM15_P24_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_15_ITEM15_P24_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_15_ITEM15_P24_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P24_S7	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_15_ITEM15_P24_S8	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_15_ITEM15_P25_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P25_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_15_ITEM15_P25_S4	The vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom are derived from government based payors.
352915_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs, and the government based payor programs in the United Kingdom, are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_15_ITEM15_P26_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future government based reimbursements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P26_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2014, 2013 and 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_15_ITEM15_P27_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_15_ITEM15_P27_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	C) Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_15_ITEM15_P28_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_15_ITEM15_P28_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_15_ITEM15_P28_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_15_ITEM15_P28_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_15_ITEM15_P28_S6	Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_15_ITEM15_P28_S7	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_15_ITEM15_P28_S8	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_15_ITEM15_P28_S9	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_15_ITEM15_P28_S10	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_15_ITEM15_P30_S2	A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states.
352915_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration.
352915_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned.
352915_15_ITEM15_P31_S2	There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered.
352915_15_ITEM15_P31_S3	Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible.
352915_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient s Medicaid eligibility.
352915_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	When the patient s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending.
352915_15_ITEM15_P32_S2	Although the patient s ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2014, 2013 or 2012 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
352915_15_ITEM15_P32_S3	We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in uninsured discounts amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_15_ITEM15_P32_S4	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable.
352915_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_15_ITEM15_P33_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_15_ITEM15_P33_S2	Effective January 1, 2014, in response to market conditions and other considerations, we modified our uninsured discount policy and increased the discount to 60% of gross charges from 30% previously.
352915_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	net accounts receivable, as compared to prior year periods.
352915_15_ITEM15_P34_S1	However, since we expect to collect only a small portion of amounts due from our uninsured patients, this change resulted in an increase in uninsured discounts and a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts.
352915_15_ITEM15_P34_S2	On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience.
352915_15_ITEM15_P34_S3	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $325 million and $395 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	Uncompensated care (charity care and uninsured discounts):
352915_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:
352915_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	The provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals decreased to approximately $590 million during 2014 as compared to $1.02 billion during 2013.
352915_15_ITEM15_P36_S2	The decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts during 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to the increase in the uninsured discount effective January 1, 2014, and reclassifications among provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending based upon our patients ultimate eligibility determination, as discussed above.
352915_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P37_S2	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	Our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 include amounts due from Illinois of approximately $44 million and $49 million, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures.
352915_15_ITEM15_P38_S2	Approximately $23 million as of December 31, 2014 and $28 million as of December 31, 2013, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date.
352915_15_ITEM15_P38_S3	In addition, our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 includes approximately $102 million and $62 million due from Texas in connection with Medicaid supplemental payment programs.
352915_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	and $24 million related to Delivery Service Reform Incentive Payment program ( DSRIP ) revenues.
352915_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	Approximately $24 million of cash was received in January, 2015 from Texas related to the above-mentioned DSRIP receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM15_P39_S2	Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois and Texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P39_S3	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois and/or Texas.
352915_15_ITEM15_P39_S4	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
352915_15_ITEM15_P39_S5	D) Concentration of Revenues: Our five majority owned acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined basis, 14% of our consolidated net revenues during each year of 2014, 2013 and 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P39_S6	E) Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
352915_15_ITEM15_P39_S7	The regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_15_ITEM15_P39_S8	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM15_P39_S9	We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
352915_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	Medicare EHR incentive payments: Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P40_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	Medicaid EHR incentive payments: Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria.
352915_15_ITEM15_P41_S1	Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria.
352915_15_ITEM15_P41_S2	Upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods.
352915_15_ITEM15_P41_S3	Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria were included in other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
352915_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	G) Property and Equipment: Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost.
352915_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	Expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts.
352915_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred.
352915_15_ITEM15_P43_S3	We remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	Construction-in-progress includes both construction projects and equipment not yet placed into service.
352915_15_ITEM15_P44_S1	We capitalize interest expense on major construction projects while in progress.
352915_15_ITEM15_P44_S2	There was no capitalized interest recorded during 2014.
352915_15_ITEM15_P44_S3	We capitalized interest on major construction projects and the development and implementation of electronic health records applications amounting to $4.9 million during 2013 and $5.7 million during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years).
352915_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	Depreciation expense (excluding discontinued operations) was $314.5 million during 2014, $285.6 million during 2013 and $270.5 million during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	H) Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_15_ITEM15_P46_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_15_ITEM15_P46_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_15_ITEM15_P46_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	I) Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_15_ITEM15_P47_S2	We have designated September 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of September 1, 2014 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_15_ITEM15_P47_S3	There were also no impairments during 2013 or 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P47_S4	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2014 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	(a) The increase in the Behavioral Health Services goodwill consists primarily of an amount that was reclassified from other assets.
352915_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	(b) The decrease in the Behavioral Health Services goodwill consists primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments.
352915_15_ITEM15_P50_S1	J) Other Assets: Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010 and Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012, consisting of Medicare licenses, certificates of need and contracts to manage the operations of behavioral health services owned by third-parties (PSI only); (ii) prepaid fees for various software and other applications used by our hospitals; (iii) costs incurred in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities; (iv) required capital reserves related to our commercial insurer; (v) deposits; (vi) investments in various businesses, including Universal Health Realty Income Trust; (vii) the invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related payable included in other noncurrent liabilities; (viii) the estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and; (ix) other miscellaneous assets.
352915_15_ITEM15_P50_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $98 million and $97 million, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	K) Physician Guarantees and Commitments: As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our accrued liabilities-other, and our other assets included $2 million and $3 million, respectively, of estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments.
352915_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	The $2 million of potential future financial obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2014 are potential 2015 obligations.
352915_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	L) Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_15_ITEM15_P52_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_15_ITEM15_P52_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_15_ITEM15_P52_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_15_ITEM15_P52_S5	See Note 8 for discussion of adjustments to our prior year reserves for claims related to our self-insured general and professional liability and workers compensation liability.
352915_15_ITEM15_P52_S6	In addition, we also: (i) own a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada, and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_15_ITEM15_P52_S7	The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_15_ITEM15_P52_S8	Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	M) Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_15_ITEM15_P55_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_15_ITEM15_P55_S2	See Note 6 Income Taxes, for additional disclosure.
352915_15_ITEM15_P55_S3	Other Noncurrent Liabilities: Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general liability, workers compensation reserves, pension and deferred compensation liabilities, and a liability incurred in connection with split-dollar life insurance agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife.
352915_15_ITEM15_P55_S4	Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest:
352915_15_ITEM15_P55_S5	Outside owners hold noncontrolling, minority ownership interests of: (i) approximately 28% in our five acute care facilities (and one additional facility currently under construction) located in Las Vegas, Nevada; (ii) 20% in an acute care facility located in Washington, D.C.; (iii) approximately 11% in an acute care facility located in Laredo, Texas, and; (iv) 20% in a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
352915_15_ITEM15_P55_S6	The redeemable noncontrolling interest balances of $240 million as of December 31, 2014 and $218 million as of December 31, 2013, and the noncontrolling interest balances of $55 million as of December 31, 2014 and $50 million as of December 31, 2013, consist primarily of the third-party ownership interests in these hospitals.
352915_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain put rights that, if exercisable, and if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member s interests at fair market value.
352915_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.
352915_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	In connection with a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the PSI acquisition, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	The accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) component of stockholders equity includes: net unrealized gains and losses on effective cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and the net minimum pension liability of a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan which covers employees at one of our subsidiaries.
352915_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	See Note 10, Pension Plan for additional disclosure regarding the defined benefit pension plan.
352915_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	The amounts recognized in AOCI for the two years ended December 31, 2014 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	Q) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities: We manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_15_ITEM15_P61_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_15_ITEM15_P61_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within stockholders equity.
352915_15_ITEM15_P61_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_15_ITEM15_P62_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_15_ITEM15_P62_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_15_ITEM15_P62_S3	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
352915_15_ITEM15_P62_S4	Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.
352915_15_ITEM15_P62_S5	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	R) Stock-Based Compensation: At December 31, 2014, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans.
352915_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	Pursuant to the FASB s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
352915_15_ITEM15_P63_S2	The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge.
352915_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	The applicable FASB guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows.
352915_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
352915_15_ITEM15_P65_S1	Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.
352915_15_ITEM15_P65_S2	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated:
352915_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Net effect of dilutive stock options and grants based on the treasury stock method , for all years presented above, excludes certain outstanding stock options applicable to each year since the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
352915_15_ITEM15_P66_S1	The excluded weighted-average stock options totaled 2,250 during 2014, 4,000 during 2013, and 2.0 million during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	T) Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The fair values of our registered debt and investments are based on quoted market prices.
352915_15_ITEM15_P67_S1	The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar maturities and credit quality.
352915_15_ITEM15_P67_S2	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
352915_15_ITEM15_P67_S3	Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	U) Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
352915_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
352915_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	V) Mergers and Acquisitions: The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions.
352915_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
352915_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
352915_15_ITEM15_P70_S2	Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred.
352915_15_ITEM15_P70_S3	The fair value of intangible assets, including Medicare Licenses, Certificates of Need, and certain contracts, is based on significant judgments made by our management, and accordingly, for significant items we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.
352915_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	During 2013, we entered into a new group purchasing organization agreement ( GPO ) and acquired a minority interest in the GPO for a nominal amount.
352915_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	In connection with the completion of an initial public offering of the stock of the GPO, during the fourth quarter of 2013, we received cash proceeds for the sale of a portion of our ownership interest, which were recorded as deferred income and included in liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.
352915_15_ITEM15_P71_S2	The deferred income is being recognized, on a pro rata basis, as a reduction to our supplies expense over the expected life of the GPO agreement.
352915_15_ITEM15_P71_S3	Also in connection with this GPO agreement and related minority interest ownership, we received shares of restricted stock in the GPO which vest ratably over a seven-year period, contingent upon our continued participation and minority ownership interest in the GPO.
352915_15_ITEM15_P71_S4	We are recognizing the fair value of this restricted stock, as a reduction to our supplies expense, in our consolidated statements of income on a pro rata basis over the vesting period.
352915_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	X) Provider Taxes: We incur health-care related taxes ( Provider Taxes ) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services.
352915_15_ITEM15_P72_S1	Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs.
352915_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments.
352915_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	Under these programs, including the impact of Uncompensated Care and Upper Payment Limit programs, and the Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive program, we earned revenues of approximately $293 million during 2014, $213 million during 2013, and $176 million during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	assessments of $137 million during 2014, $84 million during 2013, and $93 million during 2012, resulting in a net aggregate benefit of $156 million, $130 million, and $83 million, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	The aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P74_S2	In addition, under various disproportionate share hospital payment programs and the Nevada state plan amendment program, we earned revenues of $59 million in 2014, $54 million in 2013, and $47 million in 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	Y) Recent Accounting Standards: In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) updated the accounting guidance related to the definition of a discontinued operation and the related disclosures.
352915_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	The updated accounting guidance defines a discontinued operation as a disposal of a component or a group of components that is to be disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results.
352915_15_ITEM15_P75_S2	The updated guidance is applicable to us effective January 1, 2015 with early adoption permitted.
352915_15_ITEM15_P75_S3	We do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides guidance for revenue recognition.
352915_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
352915_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	This ASU also requires additional disclosures.
352915_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
352915_15_ITEM15_P78_S1	We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Preparation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15).
352915_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	Continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity s liquidation becomes imminent.
352915_15_ITEM15_P79_S2	Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting.
352915_15_ITEM15_P79_S3	If and when an entity s liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements Liquidation Basis of Accounting .
352915_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	Even when an entity s liquidation is not imminent, there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.
352915_15_ITEM15_P80_S1	In those situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the new criteria in ASU 2014-15 should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events.
352915_15_ITEM15_P80_S2	The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
352915_15_ITEM15_P80_S3	We will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU. 2) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 2015 Acquisition:
352915_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	In February, 2015, we acquired the Orchard Portman House Hospital (now called Cygnet Hospital-Taunton), a 46-bed behavioral health care facility located near Taunton, United Kingdom.
352915_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	Year ended December 31, 2014: 2014 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2014 we spent $431 million to:
352915_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their preliminary estimated fair values as follows: Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price.
352915_15_ITEM15_P83_S1	The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities: (i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.
352915_15_ITEM15_P83_S2	The vast majority of the goodwill resulting from these transactions is not deductible for federal income tax purposes (see Note 6.
352915_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	Included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 was an aggregate of approximately $175 million representing the net revenues generated at the Cygnet facilities, the commercial health insurer located in Reno, Nevada and the 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center located in Washington, D.C., from their respective dates of acquisition through December 31, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the dates of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, was not material to our 2014 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_15_ITEM15_P84_S2	Assuming the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2014, our 2014 pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $8.28 billion and our pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $558 million, or $5.55 per diluted share.
352915_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $522 million and $5.25 per diluted share.
352915_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	2014 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: During 2014 we received $15 million in connection with the divestiture of a non-operating investment (during the first quarter) and the real property of a closed behavioral health facility (during the second quarter).
352915_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	Year ended December 31, 2013: 2013 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2013, we spent an aggregate of $13 million for the purchase of real property located in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.
352915_15_ITEM15_P87_S1	The aggregate net purchase price of these properties was allocated to property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: During 2013, we received an aggregate of $37 million in connection with the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services (sold during the second quarter of 2013) and certain other assets and real property including three previously closed behavioral health care facilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	As discussed below in Discontinued Operations , we agreed to sell Peak Behavioral Health Services as part of our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation ( Ascend ) in October of 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P88_S2	The aggregate pre-tax gain on these divestitures was approximately $3 million and in included in our 2013 consolidated results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM15_P88_S3	Year ended December 31, 2012: 2012 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2012, we spent $528 million to acquire the following assets and businesses:
352915_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	spent $25 million in connection with the acquisition of physician practices and various real property.
352915_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as follows:
352915_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price.
352915_15_ITEM15_P90_S1	The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities:
352915_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	(i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.
352915_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	During the period of October 10, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the facilities acquired from Ascend generated $42 million of net revenues which are included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P91_S2	The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the date of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, and less the above-mentioned transaction costs, was not material to our 2012 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_15_ITEM15_P91_S3	Assuming the acquisition of Ascend occurred on January 1, 2012, our 2012 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $7.11 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS and unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS per diluted share would have been $464 million and $4.74 per diluted share, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: During 2012, we received $149 million from the divestiture of assets and businesses, including the following:
352915_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	received an aggregate of $6 million for the sale of the real property of two non-operating behavioral health facilities and our majority ownership interest in an outpatient surgery center located in Puerto Rico.
352915_15_ITEM15_P93_S1	Included in our 2012 consolidated results of operations was a $26 million pre-tax gain on the divestiture of Auburn.
352915_15_ITEM15_P93_S2	The divestiture of San Juan Capestrano (in January, 2012) did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM15_P93_S3	Discontinued Operations There were no material divestitures during 2014.
352915_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services ( Peak ), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
352915_15_ITEM15_P94_S1	The divestiture of Peak was completed during the second quarter of 2013 for total cash proceeds of approximately $24 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million which is included in our 2013 consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	In October of 2012, we completed the divestiture of Auburn Regional Medical Center ( Auburn ), a 159-bed acute care hospital located in Auburn, Washington, for total cash proceeds of approximately $93 million.
352915_15_ITEM15_P95_S1	This divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $26 million which was included in our 2012 consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P95_S2	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the FTC in connection with our acquisition of PSI in November, 2010, we agreed to divest three former PSI facilities (which were divested during 2011) as well as one of our legacy behavioral health facilities in Puerto Rico, which we divested in 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The following table shows the results of operations for Auburn and Peak, on a combined basis, which were reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership for each of the years presented herein (amounts in thousands).
352915_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for these facilities is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.
352915_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges: During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we had no fair value hedges outstanding.
352915_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	Cash Flow Hedges: We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_15_ITEM15_P98_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_15_ITEM15_P99_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_15_ITEM15_P99_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_15_ITEM15_P99_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_15_ITEM15_P99_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_15_ITEM15_P100_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_15_ITEM15_P100_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_15_ITEM15_P100_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_15_ITEM15_P102_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2014 and 2013 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_15_ITEM15_P104_S1	However, at December 31, 2014 and 2013, each swap agreement entered into by us was in a liability position which would require us to make the settlement payments to the counterparties.
352915_15_ITEM15_P104_S2	We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties.
352915_15_ITEM15_P104_S3	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
352915_15_ITEM15_P105_S0	During 2010, we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $600 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_15_ITEM15_P105_S1	Each of the four swaps became effective in December, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_15_ITEM15_P105_S2	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 2.38%.
352915_15_ITEM15_P105_S3	We also entered into six forward starting interest rate swaps in 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $425 million and receive three-month LIBOR.
352915_15_ITEM15_P105_S4	Three of these swaps with a total notional amount of $225 million became effective in March, 2011 and will mature in May, 2015.
352915_15_ITEM15_P105_S5	The average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 1.91%.
352915_15_ITEM15_P105_S6	The three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $75 million, $25 million and $100 million became effective in December, 2011 and had corresponding fixed rates of 1.32%, 1.96% and 2.50%.
352915_15_ITEM15_P105_S7	The $75 million, $25 million and $100 million interest rate swaps matured in December, 2012, December, 2013 and December, 2014, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	During 2011, we entered into a forward starting interest rate cap, which is now expired, on a total notional amount of $450 million from December, 2011 to December, 2012 reducing to $400 million from December, 2012 to December, 2013 whereby we paid a premium of $740,000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 7.00% and three-month LIBOR if the three-month LIBOR rate rises above 7.00% during the term of the cap.
352915_15_ITEM15_P106_S1	The three-month LIBOR never reached 7.00% during the term of the cap, which expired in December, 2013, and therefore no payment was made to us.
352915_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis.
352915_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks.
352915_15_ITEM15_P107_S2	We consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $6 million at December 31, 2014, all of which is included in other current liabilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P108_S1	At December 31, 2013, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $24 million, of which $19 million was included in other current liabilities and $5 million was included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.
352915_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	4) LONG-TERM DEBT A summary of long-term debt follows: During the third quarter of 2014, we completed the following financing transactions:
352915_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	Increased the borrowing capacity on our existing accounts receivable securitization program ( Securitization ) to $360 million from $275 million, effective August 1, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM15_P111_S0	In connection with these transactions, our 2014 results of operations included a $36 million pre-tax charge incurred for the costs related to the extinguishment of debt.
352915_15_ITEM15_P111_S1	This charge consisted of the write-off of deferred charges ($20 million) and original issue discount on the extinguished debt ($5 million) as well as the make-whole premium paid ($11 million) on the early redemption of the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes.
352915_15_ITEM15_P112_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the lender s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings, or (2) the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings.
352915_15_ITEM15_P112_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the applicable margins were 0.50% for ABR-based loans, 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan-A facilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P113_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we had $140 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility and we had $640 million of available borrowing capacity, net of $500,000 of outstanding borrowings pursuant to a short-term, on-demand credit facility and $20 million of outstanding letters of credit.
352915_15_ITEM15_P113_S1	The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit.
352915_15_ITEM15_P113_S2	The Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
352915_15_ITEM15_P113_S3	Pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amendment to our Credit Agreement, term loan-A quarterly installment payments of approximately: (i) $11 million commenced during the fourth quarter of 2014 and are scheduled to continue through September, 2016, and; (ii) $22 million are scheduled from the fourth quarter of 2016 through June, 2019.
352915_15_ITEM15_P113_S4	Prior to commencement of the Fourth Amendment, we made scheduled principal payments of $36 million on the term loan-A and term loan A2 facilities during 2014 and $72 million during 2013.
352915_15_ITEM15_P114_S0	As discussed above, on August 1, 2014, our accounts receivable securitization program ( Securitization ), with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks which is scheduled to mature in October, 2016, was amended to increase the borrowing capacity to $360 million from $275 million.
352915_15_ITEM15_P114_S1	Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals ( Receivables ) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings.
352915_15_ITEM15_P114_S2	We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings.
352915_15_ITEM15_P114_S3	We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us.
352915_15_ITEM15_P114_S4	The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P114_S5	The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_15_ITEM15_P114_S6	The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans.
352915_15_ITEM15_P114_S7	At December 31, 2014, we had $330 million of outstanding borrowings and $30 million of additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_15_ITEM15_P114_S8	On August 7, 2014, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes ) and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes , and together with the 2019 Notes, the New Senior Secured Notes ).
352915_15_ITEM15_P114_S9	The New Senior Secured Notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ).
352915_15_ITEM15_P115_S0	Interest is payable on the New Senior Secured Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year to the holders of record at the close of business on the January 15 and July 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates, commencing on February 1, 2015 until the maturity date of August 1, 2019 for the 2019 Notes and August 1, 2022 for the 2022 Notes.
352915_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	On June 30, 2006, we issued $250 million of senior secured notes which have a 7.125% coupon rate and mature on June 30, 2016 (the 7.125% Notes ).
352915_15_ITEM15_P116_S1	Interest on the 7.125% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on June 30th and December 30th of each year.
352915_15_ITEM15_P116_S2	In June, 2008, we issued an additional $150 million of 7.125% Notes which formed a single series with the original 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2006.
352915_15_ITEM15_P116_S3	Other than their date of issuance and initial price to the public, the terms of the 7.125% Notes issued in June, 2008 are identical to and trade interchangeably with, the 7.125% Notes which were originally issued in June, 2006.
352915_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	On July 31, 2014, we redeemed the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes (the Unsecured Notes ), which were scheduled to mature on October 1, 2018, at a redemption price equal to 104.56% of the principal amount of the Unsecured Notes resulting in a make-whole premium payment of approximately $11 million.
352915_15_ITEM15_P117_S1	The Unsecured Notes were issued on September 29, 2010 and registered in April, 2011.
352915_15_ITEM15_P117_S2	Interest on the Unsecured Note was payable semiannually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year.
352915_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	In connection with entering into the previous Credit Agreement on November 15, 2010, and in accordance with the Indenture dated January 20, 2000 governing the rights of our existing notes, we entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which our 7.125% Notes (due in 2016) were equally and ratably secured with the lenders under the Credit Agreement with respect to the collateral for so long as the lenders under the Credit Agreement are so secured.
352915_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	The average amounts outstanding during each of years 2014, 2013 and 2012 under the current and prior Credit Agreements, demand notes and accounts receivable securitization programs was $2.4 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, with corresponding interest rates of 1.8%, 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, including commitment and facility fees.
352915_15_ITEM15_P119_S1	The maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end were $2.65 billion in 2014, $3.00 billion in 2013 and $3.06 billion in 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P119_S2	The effective interest rate on our current and prior Credit Agreements, accounts receivable securitization programs, and demand notes, which includes the respective interest expense, commitment and facility fees, designated interest rate swaps expense and amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts, was 3.2% in 2014, 3.6% in 2013 and 4.5% in 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw.
352915_15_ITEM15_P120_S1	The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, dividends and stock repurchases; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios.
352915_15_ITEM15_P120_S2	We are in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM15_P120_S3	The carrying value of our debt at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $3.3 billion.
352915_15_ITEM15_P120_S4	The fair values of our debt at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.

352915_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	The expense associated with stock-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge.
352915_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, stock-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities and aggregated to $31.1 million in 2014, $27.8 million in 2013 and $22.5 million in 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P128_S1	In accordance with ASC 718, excess income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation are classified as cash inflows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
352915_15_ITEM15_P128_S2	During 2014, 2013 and 2012 we generated $33.9 million, $20.1 million and $16.0 million, respectively, of excess income tax benefits related to stock based compensation which are reflected as cash inflows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, as included herein.
352915_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	We adopted the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended in 2008 and 2010, (the Stock Incentive Plan ) which replaced our Amended and Restated 1992 Stock Option Plan which expired in July of 2005.
352915_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	An aggregate of 23 million shares of Class B Common Stock has been reserved under the Stock Incentive Plan.

352915_15_ITEM15_P130_S3	All outstanding options expire five years after the date of the grant.
352915_15_ITEM15_P130_S4	As of December 31, 2014, approximately 3.1 million shares of Class B Common Stock remain available for issuance pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan.
352915_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
352915_15_ITEM15_P131_S1	The following weighted average assumptions were derived from averaging the number of options granted during the most recent five-year period.
352915_15_ITEM15_P131_S2	The weighted-average assumptions reflected below were based upon twenty-one options grants for the five-year period ending December 31, 2014 and eighteen option grants for each of the five-year periods ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon four year yield in effect at the time of grant.
352915_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	The expected life of the stock options granted was estimated using the historical behavior of employees.
352915_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	Expected volatility was based on historical volatility for a period equal to the stock option s expected life.
352915_15_ITEM15_P134_S1	Expected dividend yield is based on our dividend yield at the time of grant.
352915_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	The table below summarizes our stock option activity during each of the last three years:
352915_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	The following table provides information about unvested options for the year December 31, 2014:

352915_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	6) INCOME TAXES Components of income tax expense/(benefit) are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	Deferred taxes are required to be classified based on the financial statement classification of the related assets and liabilities which give rise to temporary differences.
352915_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P145_S1	The components of deferred taxes are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	There was no material impact of deferred taxes recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Prominence Health Plan, the Psychiatric Institute of Washington and Cygnet Health Care.
352915_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (dollar amounts in thousands): Impacting the effective tax rates during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were favorable discrete tax items of approximately $1 million recorded during each year to adjust the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions.
352915_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $15 million, $6 million, and $38 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM15_P148_S1	The Company s consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on undistributed earnings that the Company does not intend to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.
352915_15_ITEM15_P148_S2	Certain of the Company s undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. have a statutory rate of 21%.
352915_15_ITEM15_P148_S3	As of December 31, 2014, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $10 million of such earnings.
352915_15_ITEM15_P148_S4	The amount of unrecognizable deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be approximately $4 million.
352915_15_ITEM15_P149_S0	A reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows:
352915_15_ITEM15_P150_S0	Included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are prepaid federal, foreign, and state income taxes amounting to approximately $17 million and $5 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM15_P150_S1	The net deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised as follows (amounts in thousands): The assets and liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible patient accounts, compensation-related accruals and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self- insurance reserves.
352915_15_ITEM15_P151_S0	At December 31, 2014, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2015 through 2034), and credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $1.11 billion representing approximately $54 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit).
352915_15_ITEM15_P151_S1	At December 31, 2014, there were foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7 million expiring through 2022 representing approximately $3 million in deferred foreign tax benefit.
352915_15_ITEM15_P152_S0	A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
352915_15_ITEM15_P152_S1	Based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized.
352915_15_ITEM15_P152_S2	Therefore, valuation allowances of approximately $50 million and $44 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM15_P152_S3	During 2014, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by approximately $6 million due to additional net operating losses incurred.
352915_15_ITEM15_P152_S4	In addition, valuation allowances of approximately $3 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 related to foreign net operating losses.
352915_15_ITEM15_P152_S5	There were no significant increases in valuation allowances as a result of the acquisition of Prominence Health Plan, the Psychiatric Institute of Washington and Cygnet Health Care.
352915_15_ITEM15_P153_S0	We adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007.
352915_15_ITEM15_P153_S1	During 2014 and 2013, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased less than $1 million due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years.
352915_15_ITEM15_P154_S0	2014, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately $1 million.
352915_15_ITEM15_P154_S1	The balance at each of December 31, 2014 and 2013, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately $2 million for each date.
352915_15_ITEM15_P154_S2	We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.
352915_15_ITEM15_P154_S3	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we have accrued interest and penalties of less than $1 million as of each date.
352915_15_ITEM15_P154_S4	The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2011 and subsequent years.
352915_15_ITEM15_P155_S0	Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years.
352915_15_ITEM15_P155_S1	The statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months.
352915_15_ITEM15_P155_S2	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months, however, it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM15_P155_S3	The tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 is as follows (amounts in thousands).
352915_15_ITEM15_P156_S0	7) LEASE COMMITMENTS Three of our hospital facilities are held under operating leases with Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms expiring in 2016 (see Note 9 for additional disclosure).
352915_15_ITEM15_P156_S1	We also lease the real property of certain facilities (see Item 2.
352915_15_ITEM15_P156_S2	A summary of property under capital lease follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_15_ITEM15_P157_S0	Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as of December 31, 2014, are as follows (amounts in thousands): During 2014, we assumed a capital lease obligation of approximately $16 million in connection with our acquisition of the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, a 124-bed behavioral health care facility located in Washington, D.C.
352915_15_ITEM15_P157_S1	We incurred no additional capital lease obligations during 2013 or 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P157_S2	In the ordinary course of business, our facilities routinely lease equipment pursuant to new lease arrangements that will likely result in future lease and rental expense in excess of amounts indicated above.
352915_15_ITEM15_P157_S3	8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Professional and General Liability, Workers Compensation Liability and Property Insurance Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability: Effective November, 2010, excluding certain subsidiaries acquired since 2010 as discussed below, the vast majority of our subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million and $3 million per occurrence, respectively.
352915_15_ITEM15_P157_S4	Our subsidiaries were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred in 2014 and up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred from 2011 through 2013.
352915_15_ITEM15_P157_S5	We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_15_ITEM15_P157_S6	Since our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence.
352915_15_ITEM15_P157_S7	The nine behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation ( Ascend ) in October, 2012 have general and professional liability policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to $12 million of aggregate coverage, subject to a $100,000 per occurrence deductible.
352915_15_ITEM15_P157_S8	The 18 facilities acquired from Cygnet Health Care Limited ( Cygnet ), consisting of 16 inpatient behavioral health hospitals and 2 nursing homes, have policies through a commercial insurance carrier located in the United Kingdom that provides for 10 million of professional liability coverage and 25 million of general liability coverage.
352915_15_ITEM15_P157_S9	The facilities acquired from PSI, Ascend and Cygnet, like our other facilities, are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations, as mentioned above.
352915_15_ITEM15_P158_S0	for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_15_ITEM15_P158_S1	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_15_ITEM15_P158_S2	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM15_P158_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $193 million, of which $51 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P158_S4	As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $206 million, of which $44 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P158_S5	We recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $20 million during 2014, $81 million during 2013 and $27 million during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P158_S6	The favorable change recorded during 2014 and 2012 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis.
352915_15_ITEM15_P158_S7	The favorable change in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2013, relating to years prior to 2013, were due primarily to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 100% from 75%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 0% from 25%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years.
352915_15_ITEM15_P158_S8	As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends.
352915_15_ITEM15_P159_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $67 million, of which $32 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P159_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $64 million, of which $34 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P159_S2	The adjustments recorded during the last three years to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P160_S0	We have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a $250,000 deductible for the majority of our properties (the properties acquired from PSI are subject to a $50,000 deductible).
352915_15_ITEM15_P160_S1	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_15_ITEM15_P160_S2	In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_15_ITEM15_P160_S3	Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented fault zones.
352915_15_ITEM15_P160_S4	Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_15_ITEM15_P160_S5	The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million, subject to a $25,000 deductible.
352915_15_ITEM15_P160_S6	Non-critical flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.
352915_15_ITEM15_P160_S7	Since certain of our facilities have been designated by our insurer as flood prone, we have elected to purchase policies from The National Flood Insurance Program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible.
352915_15_ITEM15_P160_S8	Property insurance for the facilities acquired from Cygnet are provided on an all risk basis up to a 180 million limit that includes coverage for real and personal property as well as business interruption losses.
352915_15_ITEM15_P161_S0	Legal Proceedings We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to litigation, as outlined below.
352915_15_ITEM15_P162_S0	In September, 2010, we, along with many other companies in the healthcare industry, received a letter from the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) advising of a False Claim Act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICDs ) from 2003 to 2010 at several of our acute care facilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P162_S1	The DOJ alleges that ICDs were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a National Coverage Determination regarding these devices.
352915_15_ITEM15_P162_S2	We have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_15_ITEM15_P163_S0	In February, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and several UHS owned behavioral health facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a, The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_15_ITEM15_P163_S1	The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_15_ITEM15_P163_S2	Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013.
352915_15_ITEM15_P163_S3	We were advised that a qui tam action had been filed against Roxbury Treatment Center but the government declined to intervene and the case was dismissed.
352915_15_ITEM15_P164_S0	In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various documents from January, 2005 to the date of the subpoenas.
352915_15_ITEM15_P164_S1	In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records.
352915_15_ITEM15_P164_S2	In October, 2013, we were advised by the DOJ s Criminal Frauds Section that they received a referral from the DOJ Civil Division and opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center.
352915_15_ITEM15_P164_S3	Subsequent subpoenas have since been issued to River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center requesting additional documentation.
352915_15_ITEM15_P165_S0	In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal regulations which implemented provisions of the Affordable Care Act regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations.
352915_15_ITEM15_P165_S1	The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility.
352915_15_ITEM15_P165_S2	River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension.
352915_15_ITEM15_P165_S3	In response, CMS has continued the payment suspension.
352915_15_ITEM15_P165_S4	River Point Behavioral Health has provided additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect.
352915_15_ITEM15_P165_S5	In August 2014, we received notification from CMS that, effective September, 2014, the payment suspension was to be continued for another 180 days.
352915_15_ITEM15_P165_S6	We cannot predict if and/or when the facility s suspended payments will resume.
352915_15_ITEM15_P165_S7	However, if continued for a significant period of time, the payment suspension will likely have a material adverse effect on River Point Behavioral Health s future results of operations and financial condition.
352915_15_ITEM15_P166_S0	The operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013.
352915_15_ITEM15_P167_S0	In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_15_ITEM15_P168_S0	In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy.
352915_15_ITEM15_P169_S0	In March, 2014, a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) was served on the National Deaf Academy requesting documents and information from the facility from January 1, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_15_ITEM15_P169_S1	We have been advised by the government that the National Deaf Academy has been added to the facilities which are the subject of the coordinated investigation referenced above.
352915_15_ITEM15_P170_S0	In March, 2014, CIDs were served on Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Streamwood Behavioral Health requesting documents and information from those facilities from January, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_15_ITEM15_P170_S1	In September, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division advised us that they were expanding their investigation to include four additional facilities and were requesting production of documents from these facilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P170_S2	These facilities are Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons by the Sea, and Turning Point Care Center.
352915_15_ITEM15_P171_S0	In December 2014, the DOJ Civil Division requested that Salt Lake Behavioral Health produce documents responsive to the original subpoenas issued in February, 2013.
352915_15_ITEM15_P171_S1	The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation in connection with the behavioral health facilities named above is a False Claim Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P171_S2	At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure of the Company and/or named facilities, if any, in connection with these matters.
352915_15_ITEM15_P171_S3	Matters Relating to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ): The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of PSI) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010: Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_15_ITEM15_P172_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.

352915_15_ITEM15_P172_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_15_ITEM15_P172_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_15_ITEM15_P173_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_15_ITEM15_P173_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_15_ITEM15_P173_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ.
352915_15_ITEM15_P173_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_15_ITEM15_P173_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_15_ITEM15_P174_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include, among other things, matters such as government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure, certifications, and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse.
352915_15_ITEM15_P175_S0	action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and/or regulations by healthcare providers.
352915_15_ITEM15_P175_S1	Currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_15_ITEM15_P175_S2	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to payment suspension, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_15_ITEM15_P176_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_15_ITEM15_P176_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_15_ITEM15_P176_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions, including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein.
352915_15_ITEM15_P176_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, such inquiries and/or actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_15_ITEM15_P176_S4	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P176_S5	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_15_ITEM15_P176_S6	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_15_ITEM15_P176_S7	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.
352915_15_ITEM15_P176_S8	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_15_ITEM15_P176_S9	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_15_ITEM15_P177_S0	In addition to our long-term debt obligations as discussed in Note 4.
352915_15_ITEM15_P177_S1	Long-Term Debt and our operating lease obligations as discussed in Note 7.

352915_15_ITEM15_P178_S0	9) RELATIONSHIP WITH UNIVERSAL HEALTH REALTY INCOME TRUST AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust: At December 31, 2014, we held approximately 5.9% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the Trust ).
352915_15_ITEM15_P178_S1	We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
352915_15_ITEM15_P178_S2	In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust.
352915_15_ITEM15_P178_S3	Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.
352915_15_ITEM15_P178_S4	We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $2.5 million during 2014, $2.4 million during 2013 and $2.1 million during 2012.

352915_15_ITEM15_P178_S9	Total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the Trust (as discussed below) was $16.8 million during 2014, $16.4 million during 2013 and $16.3 million during 2012.
352915_15_ITEM15_P178_S10	In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by the Trust or by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds 100% of the ownership interest.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S0	The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S1	Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S2	Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S3	The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S4	The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S5	During the third quarter of 2014, we provided notification to the Trust that, upon the December, 2014 expiration of the The Bridgeway s lease term, we intended to exercise our option to purchase the real property of the facility.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S6	On December 31, 2014, we purchased The Bridgeway s real property (a 103-bed behavioral health facility located in North Little Rock, Arkansas) from the Trust.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S7	Pursuant to the terms of the lease, we and the Trust were both required to obtain appraisals of the property to determine its fair market value.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S8	Based upon the property appraisals obtained by each party, the purchase price of The Bridgeway s real property was approximately $17.3 million.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S9	In addition, we recently constructed two free-standing emergency departments ( FEDs ) located in Weslaco and Mission, Texas which were completed and opened during the first quarter of 2015.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S10	The Trust purchased one of these FEDs from us in January, 2015 and the other in February, 2015.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S11	In conjunction with these sales, wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours, which will operate the FEDs, executed agreements with the Trust to lease the properties for initial terms of 10-years with six, 5-year renewal options.
352915_15_ITEM15_P179_S12	The aggregate construction cost/sales proceeds of these facilities was approximately $12.8 million and the aggregate rent expense paid to the Trust at the commencement of the leases will approximate $900,000 annually.
352915_15_ITEM15_P180_S0	The table below details the renewal options and terms for each of our three hospital facilities leased from the Trust:
352915_15_ITEM15_P181_S0	(a) We have three 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).
352915_15_ITEM15_P182_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term.
352915_15_ITEM15_P182_S1	In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.

352915_15_ITEM15_P182_S3	Other Related Party Transactions: In December, 2010, our Board of Directors approved the Company s entering into supplemental life insurance plans and agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer ( CEO ) and his wife.
352915_15_ITEM15_P182_S4	As a result of these agreements, based on actuarial tables and other assumptions, during the life expectancies of the insureds, we would pay approximately $25 million in premiums, and certain trusts owned by our chief executive officer, would pay approximately $8 million in premiums.
352915_15_ITEM15_P182_S5	Based on the projected premiums mentioned above, and assuming the policies remain in effect until the death of the insureds, we will be entitled to receive death benefit proceeds of no less than $33 million representing the $25 million of aggregate premiums paid by us as well as the $8 million of aggregate premiums paid by the trusts.

352915_15_ITEM15_P187_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation by $4.1 million.
352915_15_ITEM15_P188_S0	We estimate that there will be a $3.2 million net loss amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income during 2015.
352915_15_ITEM15_P188_S1	The market values of our pension plan assets at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 by asset category are as follows:
352915_15_ITEM15_P189_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio.
352915_15_ITEM15_P190_S0	The following table shows expected benefit payments for the years ended December 31, 2014 through 2024 for our defined pension plan.
352915_15_ITEM15_P190_S1	There will be benefit payments under this plan beyond 2024.

352915_15_ITEM15_P194_S2	The operating segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a business unit that offers different types of healthcare services or operates in different healthcare environments.
352915_15_ITEM15_P194_S3	The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.
352915_15_ITEM15_P194_S4	The corporate overhead allocations, as reflected below, are utilized for internal reporting purposes and are comprised of each period s projected corporate-level operating expenses (excluding interest expense).
352915_15_ITEM15_P194_S5	The overhead expenses are captured and allocated directly to each segment, to the extent possible, with the non-directly allocated overhead expenses allocated based upon each segment s respective percentage of total facility-based operating expenses.

352915_16_ITEM1_P5_S4	We also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.
352915_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Improvement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.
352915_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	We also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.
352915_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities.
352915_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	From time to time applications are filed with state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need, or CONs.
352915_16_ITEM1_P6_S4	Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.
352915_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible.
352915_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	We are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services.
352915_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures.
352915_16_ITEM1_P7_S3	In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees, communities and our stockholders.
352915_16_ITEM1_P7_S4	In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.
352915_16_ITEM1_P7_S5	We believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility.
352915_16_ITEM1_P7_S6	Generally, we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians.
352915_16_ITEM1_P7_S7	Other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P7_S8	Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology.
352915_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate.
352915_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	In addition, hospital opera tions are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated.
352915_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture.
352915_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	Average Available Beds is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available for patient care.
352915_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	A hospital may have appropriate licenses for more beds than are in service for a number of reasons, including lack of demand, incomplete construction, and anticipation of future needs.
352915_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Patient Days is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.
352915_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Occupancy Rate is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of average beds, either available or licensed.
352915_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Sources of Revenue We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Sources of Revenue for additional disclosure.
352915_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Reporting.
352915_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self-referrals by physicians).
352915_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected.
352915_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.
352915_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	Licensing, Certification and Accreditation: All of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness.
352915_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments.
352915_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, o perate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.
352915_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	All of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by The Joint Commission.
352915_16_ITEM1_P15_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_16_ITEM1_P15_S5	If any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors.
352915_16_ITEM1_P15_S6	We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards.
352915_16_ITEM1_P15_S7	The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Certificates of Need: Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need ( CON ) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility s license, which could harm our business.
352915_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions.
352915_16_ITEM1_P18_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_16_ITEM1_P18_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Utilization Review: Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services.
352915_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	The law and regulations require Peer Review Organizations ( PROs ) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group ( DRG ) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay.
352915_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program.
352915_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.
352915_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Audits: Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims.
352915_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights.
352915_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	The federal government contracts with third-party recovery audit contractors ( RACs ) and Medicaid integrity contractors ( MICs ), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers.
352915_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Recovery Audit Prepayment Review demonstration program will enable RACs to review claims before they are paid to ensure that the provider complied with all Medicare payment rules.
352915_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	Currently, the demonstration program is targeting states with high populations of fraud- and error-prone providers.
352915_16_ITEM1_P22_S3	Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors ( ZPICs ) target claims for potential fraud and abuse.
352915_16_ITEM1_P22_S4	Additionally, Medicare administrative contractors ( MACs ) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers.
352915_16_ITEM1_P22_S5	The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) announced its intent to consolidate many of these Medicare and Medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors ( UPICs ), though it remains unclear what effect, if any, this proposed consolidation may have.
352915_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years, the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial.
352915_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
352915_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation The Stark Law:
352915_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met.
352915_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	These types of referrals are known as self-referrals.
352915_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to $15,000 for each violation, up to $100,000 for sham arrangements, up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs.
352915_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart.
352915_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities.
352915_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	This regulation also places a number of compliance requirements on physician-owned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest.
352915_16_ITEM1_P27_S3	There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.
352915_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.
352915_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Anti-kickback Statute: A provision of the Social Security Act known as the anti-kickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program.
352915_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	However, changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti-kickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law.
352915_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	The anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors, from the federal anti-kickback statute for various activities.
352915_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services.
352915_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
352915_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws.
352915_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Similar State Laws: Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care.
352915_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure.
352915_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes.
352915_16_ITEM1_P33_S3	However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
352915_16_ITEM1_P33_S4	These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_16_ITEM1_P33_S5	It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_16_ITEM1_P33_S6	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see Item 3.
352915_16_ITEM1_P33_S7	Legal Proceedings), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_16_ITEM1_P33_S8	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs.
352915_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations: A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the False Claims Act s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions.
352915_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.
352915_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	When a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim.
352915_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act.
352915_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government.
352915_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 ( FERA ) has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds.
352915_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	FERA also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments.
352915_16_ITEM1_P39_S3	In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act.
352915_16_ITEM1_P39_S4	Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court.
352915_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Recent changes to the False Claims Act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified, or by the date any corresponding cost report was due, whichever is later.
352915_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil False Claims Act liability.
352915_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions: The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_16_ITEM1_P40_S3	False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud.
352915_16_ITEM1_P40_S4	Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.
352915_16_ITEM1_P40_S5	Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs.
352915_16_ITEM1_P40_S6	HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare.
352915_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.
352915_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:
352915_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH ), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically.
352915_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry.
352915_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information.
352915_16_ITEM1_P42_S3	The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed.
352915_16_ITEM1_P42_S4	Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.
352915_16_ITEM1_P42_S5	We believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of HIPAA, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance.
352915_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information.
352915_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements.
352915_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	HITECH has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred.
352915_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	We believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date.
352915_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	Recent changes to the HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers, including expanded obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.
352915_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft.
352915_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010, signed on December 18, 2010, appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the Red Flags Rule, but permits the FTC or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the Red Flags Rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft.
352915_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	Compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future.
352915_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005: On July 29, 2005, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 was enacted, which ha s the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety.
352915_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	This legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report Patient Safety Work Product ( PSWP ) to Patient Safety Organizations ( PSOs ) .
352915_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	Under the system, PSWP is made privileged, confidential and legally protected from disclosure.
352915_16_ITEM1_P45_S3	PSWP does not include medical, discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specificall y in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety.
352915_16_ITEM1_P45_S4	This legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute PSWP.
352915_16_ITEM1_P45_S5	PSOs are certified by the Secretary of the HHS for three-year periods and analyze PSWP, provide feedback to providers and may report non-identifiable PSWP to a database.
352915_16_ITEM1_P45_S6	In addition, PSOs are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies.
352915_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs.
352915_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.
352915_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine: Several states, including Florida, Nevada, California and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services.
352915_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties.
352915_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable.
352915_16_ITEM1_P47_S3	These statutes and/or regulations vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.
352915_16_ITEM1_P47_S4	We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians.
352915_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.
352915_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	EMTALA: All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act ( EMTALA ).
352915_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	This federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition.
352915_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment.
352915_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay.
352915_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program.
352915_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.
352915_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions.
352915_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively.
352915_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	CMS has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments.
352915_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future.
352915_16_ITEM1_P51_S4	We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.
352915_16_ITEM1_P51_S5	Health Care Industry Investigations: We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation.
352915_16_ITEM1_P51_S6	Legal Proceedings included herein for additional disclosure.
352915_16_ITEM1_P51_S7	In addition, currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_16_ITEM1_P51_S8	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government s inquiry and/or action in connection wit h these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.
352915_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity.
352915_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.
352915_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them.
352915_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.
352915_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	State Rate Review: Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state.
352915_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform: Medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level.
352915_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	All states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits.
352915_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	Over half of the states have limits on damages awards.
352915_16_ITEM1_P56_S3	Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits, and many states have established limits on attorney fees.
352915_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform.
352915_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform, and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates.
352915_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	Reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.
352915_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Compliance Program: Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998.
352915_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	Currently, the program s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program s policies.
352915_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	Since its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry s expectations and our needs.
352915_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business.
352915_16_ITEM1_P58_S4	Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program.
352915_16_ITEM1_P58_S5	Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas.
352915_16_ITEM1_P58_S6	Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.
352915_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our facilities located in the U.S. had approximately 72,600 employees as of December 31, 2015, of whom approximately 52,400 were employed full-time.
352915_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	In addition, our facilities located in the U.K. had approximately 2,000 employees as of December 31, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	In a number of our markets, physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours.
352915_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	Within our acute care division, approximately 190 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time.
352915_16_ITEM1_P60_S4	In addition, within our behavioral health division, approximately 435 psychiatrists are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P60_S5	Each of our hospitals is managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of ours.
352915_16_ITEM1_P60_S6	In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital.
352915_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
352915_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Approximately 1,875 of our employees at six of our hospitals are unionized.
352915_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	At Valley Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union, the International Union of Operating Engineers and the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ).
352915_16_ITEM1_P62_S2	Nurses and technicians at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the SEIU and International Union of Operating Engineers.
352915_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	the SEIU or the Hospital Police Association.
352915_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	At the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, cli nical, clerical, support and maintenance employees are represented by the Communication Workers of America (AFL-CIO).
352915_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	In February, 2016, n urses at Corona Regional Medical Center ( Corona ), who were previously represented by the United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals ( UNAC/UHCP ) , submitted to the hospital objective evidence that the union no longer had majority support of the nurses.
352915_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	The nurses requested that the hospital withdraw recognition of UNAC/UHCP as their barg aining representative .
352915_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	After verification of the evidence presented, Corona granted the request of the nurses.
352915_16_ITEM1_P65_S3	UNAC/UHCP has the right to challenge the withdrawal of recognition.
352915_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain technicians and thera pists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU.
352915_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	Pennsylvania Ass ociation of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals.
352915_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	The health care industry is highly competitive.
352915_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment.
352915_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes.
352915_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_16_ITEM1_P69_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us.
352915_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.
352915_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in determining a hospital s success and competitive advantage.
352915_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient s needs, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital s facilities.
352915_16_ITEM1_P71_S3	We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.
352915_16_ITEM1_P71_S4	In addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals.
352915_16_ITEM1_P71_S5	We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_16_ITEM1_P71_S6	Our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate.
352915_16_ITEM1_P71_S7	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_16_ITEM1_P71_S8	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	Many states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws.
352915_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states.
352915_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.
352915_16_ITEM1_P72_S3	Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges.
352915_16_ITEM1_P73_S2	In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients.
352915_16_ITEM1_P73_S3	Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience.
352915_16_ITEM1_P73_S4	The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.
352915_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	A key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets.
352915_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	The competition to acquire hospitals is significant.
352915_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_16_ITEM1_P74_S3	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational gr owth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust At December 31, 2015, we held approximately 5.9% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the Trust ).
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement, which is scheduled to expire on December 31 st of each year, pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S3	In December, 2015, the advisory agreement was renewed by the Trust for 2016 pursuant to the same terms in place during each of the last three years.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S4	During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the advisory fee was computed at 0.70% of the Trust s average invested real estate assets.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S5	In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S6	Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S7	We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $2.8 million during 2015, $2.5 million during 2014 and $2.4 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S8	Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.4 million during 2015, $3.2 million during 2014 and $842,000 during 2013, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S9	Included in our share of the Trust s income was approximately $500,000 in 2015, and $2.3 million in 2014, related to our share of gains on various transactions recorded by the Trust.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S10	The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $8.7 million and $9.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S11	The market value of our investment in the Trust was $39.4 million at December 31, 2015 and $37.9 million at December 31, 2014, based on the closing price of the Trust s stock on the respective dates.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S12	Total rent expense under the operating leases on the three hospital facilities with the Trust during 2015 was $15.6 million.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S13	Total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the Trust during 2014 and 2013 (as discussed below) was $16.8 million and $16.4 million, respectively.
352915_16_ITEM1_P75_S14	In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by the Trust or by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds 100% of the ownership interest.
352915_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries.
352915_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms.
352915_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below.
352915_16_ITEM1_P76_S3	The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year.
352915_16_ITEM1_P76_S4	The leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.
352915_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	During the first quarter of 2015, wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours sold to and leased back from the Trust, two newly constructed free-standing emergency departments ( FEDs ) located in Texas which were completed and opened during the first quarter of 2015.
352915_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	In conjunction with these transactions, ten-year lease agreements with six, five-year renewal options have been executed with the Trust.
352915_16_ITEM1_P77_S2	We have the option to purchase the properties upon the expiration of the fixed terms and each five-year renewal terms at the fair market value of the property.
352915_16_ITEM1_P77_S3	The aggregate construction cost/sales proceeds of these facilities was approximately $13 million, and the aggregate rent expense paid to the Trust at the commencement of the leases will approximate $900,000 annually.
352915_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	In December, 2014, upon the expiration of the lease term, we elected to purchase from the Trust for $17.3 million, the real property of The Bridgeway, a 103-bed behavioral health care facility located in North Little Rock, Arkansas.
352915_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the lease, we and the Trust were both required to obtain appraisals of the property to determine its fair market value/purchase price.
352915_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	The rent expense paid by us to the Trust, prior to our purchase of The Bridgeway s real property in December, 2014, was approximately $1.1 million annually.
352915_16_ITEM1_P78_S3	The table below details the renewal options and terms for each of our three hospital facilities leased from the Trust:
352915_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	We have three 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).
352915_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the three hospital leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term.
352915_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	We also have the right to purchase the respective leased hospitals at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at their appraised fair market value as well as purchase any or all of the three leased hospital properties at the appraised fair market value upon one month s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur.
352915_16_ITEM1_P80_S2	In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.

352915_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 11% in 2015, 17% in 2014, and 15% in 2013 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We own 6 inpatient acute care hospitals and 4 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 15% in 2015, 16% in 2014, and 15% in 2013 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 10% in 2015, 11% in 2014, and 6% in 2013 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	California: We own 5 inpatient acute care hospitals and 8 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 11% in 2015, 10% in 2014, and 9% in 2013 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 11% in 2015, 8% in 2014, and 4% in 2013 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	The significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative, regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in Texas, Nevada and California.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We derive a significant portion of our revenue from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, the vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom are derived from governmental payors.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If the rates paid or the scope of services covered by governmental payors in the United States or United Kingdom are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Washington, D.C., California, Nevada, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Massachusetts and Florida, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors, including managed care providers, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Private payors, including managed care providers, increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Reductions or changes in Medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	On January 3, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the 2012 Act ).
352915_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The 2012 Act postponed for two months sequestration cuts mandated under the Budget Control Act of 2011.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The postponed sequestration cuts include a 2% annual reduction over ten years in Medicare spending to providers.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In order to offset the costs of the legislation, the 2012 Act reduces payments to other providers totaling almost $26 billion over ten years.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Approximately half of those funds will come from reductions in Medicare reimbursement to hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 has reduced certain sequestration-related budgetary cuts, spending reductions related to the Medicare program remain in place.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	On December 26, 2013, President Obama signed into law H.J. Res. 59, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which includes the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 ( the Act ).
352915_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, on February 15, 2014, Public Law 113-082 was enacted.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The Act and subsequent federal legislation achieves new savings by extending sequestration for mandatory programs including Medicare for another three years, through 2024.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Sources of Revenue-Medicare , for additional disclosure.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The 2012 Act includes a document and coding ( DCI ) adjustment and a reduction in Medicaid d isproportionate share hospital ( DSH ) payments.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Expected to save $10.5 billion over 10 years, the DCI adjustment decreases projected Medicare hospital payments for inpatient and overnight care through a downward adjustment in annual base payment increases .
352915_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	These reductions are meant to recoup what Medicare authorities consider to be overpayments to hospitals that occurred as a result of the transition to Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The reduction in Medicaid DSH payments is expected to sav e $4.2 billion over 10 years.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	This provision extends the changes regarding DSH payments established by the Legislation and determines future allotments off of the rebased level.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA ).
352915_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Reconciliation Act ), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the Legislation ), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Although it is expected that as a result of the Legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients, which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable, the Legislation makes a number of other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	It has been projected that the Legislation will result in a net reduction in Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals totaling $155 billion over 10 years.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Legislation revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning October 1, 2011 for Medicare Part B reimbursable items and services and beginning October 1, 2012 for Medicare inpatient hospital services.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The Legislation and subsequent revisions provide for reductions to both Medicare DSH and Medicaid DSH payments.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	The Medicare DSH reductions began in October, 2013 with no material adverse impact to the reimbursements we receive expected until 2015 while Medicaid DSH reimbursements would not be adversely impacted until 2016.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Legislation implements a value-based purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or hospital-acquired condition rates.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	A 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government s ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the Legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Pursuant to that decision, the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing Medicaid funding.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Therefore, states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of federal Medicaid funding.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	As a result, many states, including Texas, have not expanded their Medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	There have been several attempts in Congress to repeal or modify various provisions of the Legislation.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We cannot predict whether or not any of these proposed changes to the PPACA will become law and therefore can provide no assurance that changes to the Legislation, as currently implemented, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition, in King vs. Burwell , the Supreme Court decided in favor of the federal government s ability to subsidize premiums paid by certain eligible individuals that obtain health insurance policies through federally facilitated exchanges.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A number of our hospitals operate in states that utilize federally facilitated exchanges.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The Supreme Court s decision in this case ultimately preserved the viability of federally facilitated exchanges.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	A different decision by the Supreme Court could have resulted in an increased number of uninsured patients generally, including an increase of uninsured patients treated at our hospitals located in these states.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The various provisions in the Legislation that directly or indirectly affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The impact of the Legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations, interpretive guidance and possible future legislation or legal challenges.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Certain Legislation provisions, such as those creating the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, create uncertainty in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Thus, we cannot predict the impact of the Legislation on our future reimbursement at this time and we can provide no assurance that the Legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Legislation amends several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act, although final regulations implementing this statutory requirement remain pending.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The Legislation also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The impact of the Legislation on each of our hospitals may vary.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Because Legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years, we anticipate that many of the provisions in the Legislation may be subject to further revision.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We cannot predict the impact the Legislation may have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity, or whether we will be able to successfully adapt to the changes required by the Legislation.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In accordance with our internal policies and procedures, as well as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical treatment (whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P24_S5	If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition, we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient s medical condition, within the facility s capability, or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital s written procedures.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Our obligations under EMTALA may increase substantially going forward; CMS has sought stakeholder comments concerning the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively, but has yet to issue further guidance in response to that request.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P24_S7	If the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly, or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under EMTALA is proposed and adopted, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P24_S8	If we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price, patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In recent years, the number of quality measures that hospitals are required to report publicly has increased.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	CMS publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the Medicare program.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Additionally, the Legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish, update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If any of our hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys (or results that are lower than our competitors) or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volume could decline because patients may elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	This circumstance could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	An increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Collection of receivables from third-party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and deductibles.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S7	However, we also have substantial receivables due to us as of December 31, 2015 (a significant portion of which is past due) from certain state-based funding programs, most particularly Illinois and Texas as discussed herein.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S8	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables, historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S9	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S10	Significant changes in business office operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P26_S11	If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals, and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	As a result, most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a result, the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals, and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	They may terminate their affiliation with us at any time.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P30_S4	If we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P30_S5	It may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals are located.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Generally, the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P30_S8	The loss of one or more of these physicians, even if temporary, could cause a material reduction in our revenues, which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	If we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment, our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The technology used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and, as a result, manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	To compete effectively, we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry, patients may seek treatment from other providers and/or physicians may refer their patients to alternate sources, which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	If we fail to continue to meet the meaningful use criteria related to electronic health record systems ( EHR ), our operations could be harmed.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Pursuant to HITECH regulations, hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P32_S5	We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P32_S6	However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of opera tions.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	This shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S5	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S6	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets, which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S7	We cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S8	If our general labor and related expenses increase, we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S9	Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S10	Increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S11	Union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future, to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionized, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P33_S12	If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things: hospital billing practices and prices for services; relationships with physicians and other referral sources; adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services; ownership of facilities; qualifications of medical and support personnel; confidentiality, maintenance, privacy and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our facilities; operating policies and procedures, and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Among these laws are the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, ( HIPAA ), the federal anti-kickback statute and the provision of the Social Security Act commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	These laws, and particularly the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	A number of our current arrangements, including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	CMS published a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol, which is intended to allow providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark law.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the Stark law, there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the Stark Law or that self-disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Federal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that require us to implement and, in the future, may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient s health and related financial information.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Such privacy and security regulations impose extensive administrative, physical and technical requirements on us, restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information, provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Additionally, recent changes to HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements, including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	These laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws (see Item 3 Legal Proceedings ), or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material ad verse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what f orm such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	See Item 1 Business Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation .
352915_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We are subject to occupational health, safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Regulatory requirements affecting us include, but are not limited to, those covering: (i) air and water quality control; (ii) occupational health and safety (e.g., standards regarding blood-borne pathogens and ergonomics, etc.); (iii) waste management; (iv) the handling of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances; and (v) other hazardous materials.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S5	If we fail to comply with those standards, we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S6	We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S7	We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S8	Some of these actions may involve large claims, as well as significant defense costs.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S9	We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S10	In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may choose to negotiate a settlement.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P40_S11	Amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	All professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We believe that, based on our past experience and actuarial estimates, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	While we continuously monitor our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We may be subject to governmental investigations, regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The federal False Claims Act permits private parties to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits against companies.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Legal Proceedings for disclosure of current related matters.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The failure of certain employers, or the closure of certain facilities, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The economies in the non-urban communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The failure of one or more large employer or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our hospitals operate, could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	The occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations, thereby harming our business.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	If any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	All of our hospitals are deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	We believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S5	However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Our growth strategy depends, in part, on acquisitions, and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S7	We may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not-for-profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S8	Acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S9	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit healthcare companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S10	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P48_S11	Also, suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that affect the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a healthcare facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation, increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals, increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria, any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital s results of operations, allocation of the purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S6	We may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire, which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S7	We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S8	We may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S9	Integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S10	In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by acquired hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S11	In addition, some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P49_S12	If we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire, operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals, our results of operations could be harmed.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We believe that value-based purchasing initiatives of both governmental and private payers tying financial incentives to quality and efficiency of care will increasingly affect the results of operations of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities and may negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet expected quality standards.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing in federal healthcare programs.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Medicare now requires providers to report certain quality measures in order to receive full reimbursement increases for inpatient and outpatient procedures that were previously awarded automatically.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	In addition, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive increased reimbursement payments, and hospitals that have excess readmissions for specified conditions will receive reduced reimbursement.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Furthermore, Medicare no longer pays hospitals additional amounts for the treatment of certain hospital-acquired conditions unless the conditions were present at admission.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, hospitals that rank in the worst 25% of all hospitals nationally for hospital acquired conditions in the previous year will receive reduced Medicare reimbursements.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for treating certain provider-preventable conditions.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	There is a trend among private payers toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services, as well.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Many large commercial payers require hospitals to report quality data, and several of these payers will not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet quality standards established by both governmental and private payers.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility s reputation could harm our business.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P57_S5	Our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions (see Item 3-Legal Proceedings ).
352915_16_ITEM1A_P57_S6	In addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P57_S7	Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our legal proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity following the merger and our ability to achieve expected benefits of the merger.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P57_S8	In particular, government investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to material fines, penalties, damages payments or other sanctions, including exclusion from government healthcare programs.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P57_S9	Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted Certificates of Need, or CON, laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization review, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors, including physicians clinical decisions and availability, payor programs shifting to a more outpatient-based environment, whether or not certain services are offered, seasonal and severe weather conditions, including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornados, earthquakes, current local economic and demographic changes.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	In addition, technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our facilities could adversely impact our business.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S4	If a pandemic or other public health crisis were to affect our markets, our business could be adversely affected.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Such a crisis could diminish the public trust in healthcare facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or that are treating (or have treated) patients affected by contagious diseases.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S6	If any of our facilities were involved in treating patients for such a contagious disease, other patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S7	Further, a pandemic might adversely impact our business by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our facilities.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S8	Although we have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, the potential impact of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease with respect to our markets or our facilities is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S9	A worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S10	Our patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance, which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S11	Worsening of economic conditions may result in a higher unemployment rate which may increase the number of individuals without health insurance.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S12	As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or an increase in services provided to uninsured patients.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S13	These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S14	In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.60 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S15	Should the revenues and financial results of our acute care and/or behavioral health care facilities be materially, unfavorably impacted due to, among other things, a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates, a continued rise in the unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P61_S16	Fluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future, the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition to our operating results, many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P62_S4	These factors include certain of the risks discussed herein, demographic changes, operating results of other hospital companies, changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts, speculation in the press or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, managed care contract negotiations and terminations, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	We are exposed to currency exchange risk with respect to the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Pound sterling, because a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in Pounds.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We monitor changes in our exposure to exchange rate risk.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P63_S3	While we may elect to enter into hedging arrangements to protect our business against certain currency fluctuations, these hedging arrangements do not provide comprehensive protection, and our results of operations could be adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P64_S2	While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P64_S3	For example, we cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P64_S4	We also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P64_S5	If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P64_S6	If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P64_S7	A cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of member privacy, or other negative impacts.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We rely extensively on our information technology ( IT ) systems to manage clinical and financial data, communicate with our patients, payors, vendors and other third parties and summarize and analyze operating results.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize electronic health records and to become meaningful users of health information technology pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	A cyber-attack that bypasses our IT security systems causing an IT security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws, loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption of our IT business systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of public health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Generally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P66_S5	Differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P68_S3	The deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P68_S4	We require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P68_S5	We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P68_S6	We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	To fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P70_S1	In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P70_S3	We depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P70_S4	The expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P70_S5	The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities, which could harm our business.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	At December 31, 2015, 24.1 million shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P71_S3	To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the current holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P71_S4	In addition, from time-to-time our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P71_S6	Conversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P71_S7	Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The right to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P72_S2	As of March 26, 2015, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 7.3% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect five members of the Board of Directors and constituted 86.1% of our general voting power as of that date.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P72_S3	As of March 26, 2015, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options) constituted 92.7% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 13.9% of our general voting power as of that date.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P72_S4	As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P72_S5	Each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).
352915_16_ITEM1A_P72_S6	In the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock, which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his family, one of whom (Marc D. Miller) is also a director and officer of our company, and they can elect a majority of our company s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.
352915_16_ITEM1A_P73_S2	In addition, because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.
352915_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	We own office buildings in King of Prussia and Wayne, Pennsylvania, Brentwood, Tennessee, Denton, Texas and Reno, Nevada.
352915_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	liability companies ( LLCs ) in which we hold controlling, majority ownership interests of approximately 72%.
352915_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	The remaining minority ownership interests in these facilities are held by unaffiliated third-parties.
352915_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	All hospitals are managed by us.
352915_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	We hold an 80% ownership interest in this facility through a general partnership interest in a limited partnership.
352915_16_ITEM2_P2_S1	The remaining 20% ownership interest is held by an unaffiliated third-party.
352915_16_ITEM2_P3_S0	Real property leased from Universal Health Realty Income Trust.
352915_16_ITEM2_P4_S0	Edinburg Regional Medical Center/Children s Hospital, McAllen Medical Center, McAllen Heart Hospital, South Texas Behavioral Health Center, STHS ER at Mission and STHS ER at Weslaco are consolidated under one license operating as the South Texas Health System.
352915_16_ITEM2_P5_S0	We manage and own a noncontrolling interest of approximately 50% in the entity that operates this facility.
352915_16_ITEM2_P6_S0	We own minority interests in an LLC that owns and operates this center which is managed by a third-party.
352915_16_ITEM2_P7_S0	We own a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 50% in the entity that operates this facility that is managed by a third-party.
352915_16_ITEM2_P8_S0	We hold an 89% ownership interest in this facility through both general and limited partnership interests.
352915_16_ITEM2_P8_S1	The remaining 11% ownership interest is held by unaffiliated third parties.
352915_16_ITEM2_P9_S0	Land of this facility is leased.
352915_16_ITEM2_P10_S0	Newly constructed facility that is expected to be completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2016.
352915_16_ITEM2_P11_S0	We own or lease medical office buildings adjoining some of our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM2_P11_S1	We believe that the leases on the facilities, medical office buildings and other real estate leased or owned by us do not impose any material limitation on our operations.
352915_16_ITEM2_P11_S2	The aggregate lease payments on facilities leased by us were $69 million in 2015, $66 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2013.
352915_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations, regulatory matters and litigation, as outlined below.
352915_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) and Government Investigations: In February, 2013, the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and certain UHS owned behavioral health facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013.
352915_16_ITEM3_P1_S3	We were advised that a qui tam action had been filed against Roxbury Treatment Center but the government declined to intervene and the case was dismissed.
352915_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various documents from January, 2005 to the date of the subpoenas.
352915_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records.
352915_16_ITEM3_P2_S2	In October, 2013, we were advised by the DOJ s Criminal Frauds Section that they received a referral from the DOJ Civil Division and opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center.
352915_16_ITEM3_P2_S3	Subsequent subpoenas have since been issued to River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center requesting additional documentation.
352915_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal regulations regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations.
352915_16_ITEM3_P3_S1	The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility.
352915_16_ITEM3_P3_S2	River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension.
352915_16_ITEM3_P3_S3	Notwithstanding, CMS continued the payment suspension.
352915_16_ITEM3_P3_S4	River Point Behavioral Health provided additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect.
352915_16_ITEM3_P3_S5	In August, 2015, we received notification from CMS that, effective September, 2015, the payment suspension will be continued for another 180 days.
352915_16_ITEM3_P3_S6	We cannot predict if and/or when the facility s suspended payments will resume.
352915_16_ITEM3_P3_S7	Although the operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014, the payment suspension has had a material adverse effect on the facility s results of operations and financial condition.
352915_16_ITEM3_P4_S0	In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_16_ITEM3_P4_S1	In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy.
352915_16_ITEM3_P5_S0	In March, 2014, a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) was served on the National Deaf Academy requesting documents and information from the facility from January 1, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_16_ITEM3_P5_S1	We have been advised by the government that the National Deaf Academy has been added to the facilities which are the subject of the coordinated investigation referenced above.
352915_16_ITEM3_P6_S0	In March, 2014, CIDs were served on Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Streamwood Behavioral Health requesting documents and information from those facilities from January, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_16_ITEM3_P6_S1	In September, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division advised us that they were expanding their investigation to include four additional facilities and were requesting production of documents from these facilities.
352915_16_ITEM3_P6_S2	These facilities are Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons by the Sea, and Turning Point Care Center.
352915_16_ITEM3_P7_S0	In December, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division requested that Salt Lake Behavioral Health produce documents responsive to the original subpoenas issued in February, 2013.
352915_16_ITEM3_P7_S1	In March, 2015, the OIG issued subpoenas to Central Florida Behavioral Hospital and University Behavioral Center requesting certain documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_16_ITEM3_P7_S2	In late March, 2015, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include UHS as a corporate entity arising out of the coordinated investigation of the facilities described above and, in particular, Hartgrove Hospital.
352915_16_ITEM3_P7_S3	In December, 2015, we were notified by the DOJ Civil Division that the civil investigation also includes Arbour Hospital, Arbour-Fuller Hospital, Pembroke Hospital and Westwood Lodge located in Massachusetts.
352915_16_ITEM3_P7_S4	To date, these facilities have not received any requests for documentation or other information.
352915_16_ITEM3_P7_S5	The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation referenced above is a False Claim Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities.
352915_16_ITEM3_P7_S6	At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure of the Company and/or named facilities, if any, in connection with these matters.
352915_16_ITEM3_P8_S0	In December, 2015, we were advised that the DOJ opened an investigation involving the El Paso Behavioral Health System in El Paso, Texas.
352915_16_ITEM3_P8_S1	The DOJ is investigating potential Stark law violations relating to arrangements between the facility and physician(s) at the facility.
352915_16_ITEM3_P8_S2	These agreements were entered into before we acquired the facility as a part of our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.
352915_16_ITEM3_P8_S3	To our knowledge, this matter is not a part of the omnibus investigation referenced above.
352915_16_ITEM3_P8_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_16_ITEM3_P9_S0	In January, 2016, we were notified that the Department of Justice opened an investigation of the South Texas Health System of a potential False Claim Act case regarding compensation paid to cardiologists pursuant to employment agreements entered into in 2005.
352915_16_ITEM3_P9_S1	At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_16_ITEM3_P10_S0	Regulatory Matters: On July 23, 2015, Timberlawn Mental Health System ( Timberlawn ) received notification from CMS of its intent to terminate Timberlawn s Medicare provider agreement effective August 7, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM3_P10_S1	This notification resulted from surveys conducted which alleged that Timberlawn was out of compliance with conditions of participation required for participation in the Medicare/Medicaid program.
352915_16_ITEM3_P10_S2	We filed a request for expedited administrative appeal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeals Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review and reversal of the termination action.
352915_16_ITEM3_P10_S3	In conjunction with the administrative appeal, we filed litigation in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of Texas seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to have the termination stayed pending the conclusion of the administrative appeal.
352915_16_ITEM3_P10_S4	The trial court denied Timberlawn s request for a temporary restraining order and dismissed the case.
352915_16_ITEM3_P10_S5	Timberlawn s provider agreement was terminated effective August 14, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM3_P10_S6	In September, 2015 Timberlawn reached an agreement with CMS relative to its reapplication to the Medicare/Medicaid program.
352915_16_ITEM3_P10_S7	In exchange, Timberlawn agreed to dismiss its administrative appeal as well as not to pursue an appeal of the decision of the trial court.
352915_16_ITEM3_P10_S8	During this time, Timberlawn has remained open.
352915_16_ITEM3_P11_S0	In December, 2015, Timberlawn received notice from the Texas Department of State Health Services of its intent to revoke Timberlawn s license and impose an administrative penalty.
352915_16_ITEM3_P11_S1	We have appealed and are contesting the proposed revocation and fine.
352915_16_ITEM3_P12_S0	In January, 2016, Timberlawn submitted its application for re-enrollment into the Medicare/Medicaid program.
352915_16_ITEM3_P13_S0	Although the operating results of Timberlawn did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014, the termination of Timberlawn s provider agreement has had a material adverse effect on the facility s results of operations and financial condition.
352915_16_ITEM3_P14_S0	During the second quarter of 2015, Texoma Medical Center ( Texoma ), which includes TMC Behavioral Health Center, entered into a Systems Improvement Agreemen t ( SIA ) with CMS.
352915_16_ITEM3_P14_S1	The SIA abated a termination action from CMS following surveys which identified alleged failures to comply with conditions of participation primarily involving Texoma s behavioral health operations.
352915_16_ITEM3_P15_S0	The terms of the SIA required Texoma to engage independent consultants/experts approved by CMS to analyze and develop implementation plans at Texoma to meet Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_16_ITEM3_P15_S1	At the conclusion of the SIA, CMS will conduct a full certification survey to determine if Texoma is in substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_16_ITEM3_P15_S2	The term of agreement is set to conclude October 2, 2016 unless the terms of the agreement are fulfilled earlier.
352915_16_ITEM3_P16_S0	During the term of the SIA, Texoma remains eligible to receive rei mbursements from Medicare and Medicaid for services rendered to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
352915_16_ITEM3_P17_S0	In late September, 2015, many hospitals in Pennsylvania, including seven of our behavioral health care hospitals located in the state, received letters from the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare ( DPW ) demanding repayment of allegedly excess Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments ( DSH ) for the federal fiscal year 2011 ( FFY2011 ) amounting to approximately $4 million in the aggregate.
352915_16_ITEM3_P17_S1	We have filed administrative appeals for all of our facilities contesting the recoupment efforts since we believe DPW s calculation methodology is inaccurate and conflicts with applicable federal and state laws and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM3_P17_S2	DPW has agreed to postpone the recoupment of the state s share of the DSH payments until all hospital appeals are resolved.
352915_16_ITEM3_P17_S3	DPW also extended the deadline to recoup the federal share (2011 federal share is 55%) until April 30, 2016.
352915_16_ITEM3_P17_S4	However, if DPW is ultimately successful in its demand related to FFY2011, it could take similar action with regards to FFY2012 through FFY2014.
352915_16_ITEM3_P18_S0	Due to a change in the Pennsylvania Medicaid State Plan and implementation of a CMS-approved Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver, we do not believe the methodology applied by DPW to FFY2011 is applicable to reimbursements received for Medicaid services provided after January 1, 2015 by our behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania.
352915_16_ITEM3_P18_S1	We can provide no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our legal and administrative appeals related to DPW s repayment demands.
352915_16_ITEM3_P18_S2	If our legal and administrative appeals are unsuccessful, our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by these repayments.
352915_16_ITEM3_P19_S0	Matters Relating to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ): The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of PSI) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010.
352915_16_ITEM3_P20_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_16_ITEM3_P21_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_16_ITEM3_P21_S1	The requested documents were collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_16_ITEM3_P21_S2	Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July, 2011 requesting additional documents, which have also been delivered to the DOJ.
352915_16_ITEM3_P21_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_16_ITEM3_P21_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_16_ITEM3_P22_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_16_ITEM3_P22_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_16_ITEM3_P22_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ.
352915_16_ITEM3_P22_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_16_ITEM3_P22_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_16_ITEM3_P22_S5	We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry which subjects us to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations.
352915_16_ITEM3_P22_S6	These claims or suits include claims for damages for personal injuries, medical malpractice, commercial/contractual disputes, wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians staff privileges, and employment related claims, In addition, health care companies are subject to investigations and/or actions by various state and federal governmental agencies or those bringing claims on their behalf.
352915_16_ITEM3_P22_S7	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations against healthcare providers concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes as well as compliance with clinical and operational regulations.
352915_16_ITEM3_P22_S8	Currently, and from time to time, we and some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries in the form of subpoenas, Civil Investigative Demands, audits and other document requests from various federal and state agencies.
352915_16_ITEM3_P22_S9	These inquiries can lead to notices and/or actions including repayment obligations from state and federal government agencies associated with potential non-compliance with laws and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM3_P22_S10	Further, the federal False Claim Act allows private individuals to bring lawsuits (qui tam actions) against healthcare providers that submit claims for payments to the government.
352915_16_ITEM3_P23_S0	Various states have also adopted similar statutes.
352915_16_ITEM3_P23_S1	When such a claim is filed, the government will investigate the matter and decide if they are going to intervene in the pending case.
352915_16_ITEM3_P24_S0	the False Claims Act s requirements.
352915_16_ITEM3_P24_S1	If the government chooses not to intervene, the private individual(s) can procee d independently on behalf of the government.
352915_16_ITEM3_P25_S0	Health care providers that are found to violate the False Claims Act may be subject to substantial monetary fines/penalties as well as face potential exclusion from participating in government health care progra ms or be required to comply with Corporate Integrity Agreements as a condition of a settlement of a False Claim Act matter.
352915_16_ITEM3_P26_S0	In September 2014, the Criminal Division of the DOJ, announced that all qui tam cases will be shared with their Division to determin e if a parallel criminal investigation should be opened.
352915_16_ITEM3_P26_S1	The DOJ has also announced an intention to pursue civil and criminal actions against individuals within a company as well as the corporate entity or entities.
352915_16_ITEM3_P26_S2	In addition, health care facilities are subject to monitoring by state and federal surveyors to ensure compliance with program Conditions of Participation.
352915_16_ITEM3_P26_S3	In the event a facility is found to be out of compliance with a Condition of Participation and unable to remedy the alleged deficiency(s), t he facility faces termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or compliance with a System Improvement Agreement to remedy deficiencies and ensure compliance.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S0	The laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry are complex covering, among other things, government healthcare participation requirements, licensure, certification and accreditation, privacy of patient information, reimbursement for patient services as well as fraud and abuse compliance.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and expanding.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S2	Further, the Affordable Care Act has added additional obligations on healthcare providers to report and refund overpayments by government healthcare programs and authorizes the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S3	We monitor our business and have developed an ethics and compliance program with respect to these complex laws, rules and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S4	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with government regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with the sanctions referenced above which include fines, penalties and/or substantial damages, repayment obligations, payment suspensions, licensure revocation, and expulsion from government healthcare programs.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S5	Even if we were to ultimately prevail in any action brought against us or our facilities or in responding to any inquiry, such action or inquiry could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S6	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S7	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S8	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S9	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S10	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_16_ITEM3_P27_S11	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

352915_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers.
352915_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	As of February 25, 2016, we owned and/or operated 24 inpatient acute care hospitals, 3 free-standing emergency departments and 213 inpatient and 16 outpatient behavioral health care facilities located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
352915_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	In addition, we are building a newly-constructed acute care hospital located in Henderson, Nevada, that is scheduled to be completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2016.
352915_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	We also manage and/or own outright or in partnerships with physicians, 4 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 4 states.
352915_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	As a percentage of our consolidated net revenues, net revenues from our acute care hospitals, surgical hospitals, commercial health insurer, surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 51% during each of 2015 and 2014 and 49% during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P0_S5	Net revenues from our behavioral health care operations accounted for 49% of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2015 and 2014 and 51% during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.

352915_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors You should carefully review the information contained in this Annual Report, and should particularly consider any risk factors that we set forth in this Annual Report and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	In this Annual Report, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance.
352915_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities.
352915_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, and statements of our goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.
352915_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Words such as may, will, should, could, would, predicts, potential, continue, expects, anticipates, future, intends, plans, believes, estimates, appears, projects and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	In evaluating those statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks related to healthcare industry trends and those set forth herein in Item 1A. Risk Factors .
352915_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved.
352915_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Such factors include, among other things, the following:
352915_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	an increasing number of legislative initiatives have been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level.
352915_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters as disclosed in Item 3.
352915_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	as discussed below in Sources of Revenue, we receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate, (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Washington, D.C., California, Nevada, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Massachusetts and Florida); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including Texas, Illinois, Oklahoma, Mississippi, California, Ohio and Arkansas, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina.
352915_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	in March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade.
352915_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore were not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.
352915_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most federal a gencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the Joint Committee ), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (annual redu ction of approximately $36 million to our Medicare net revenues) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, continued the 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 Act.
352915_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 include amounts due from Illinois of approximately $28 million and $44 million, respectively.
352915_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures.
352915_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Approximately $12 million as of December 31, 2015 and $23 million as of December 31, 2014, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date.
352915_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	In addition, our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 includes approximately $80 million and $102 million, respectively, due from Texas in connection with Medicaid supplemental payment programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P14_S4	The $80 million due from Texas as of December 31, 2015 consists of $47 million related to uncompensated care program revenues, $9 million related to disproportionate share hospital program revenues and $24 million related to Delivery Service Reform Incentive Payment program ( DSRIP ) revenues.
352915_16_ITEM7_P14_S5	The above-mentioned Texas DSRIP receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2015 were collected in January, 2016.
352915_16_ITEM7_P14_S6	Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois and Texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P14_S7	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois and/or Texas.
352915_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	there have been several attempts in Congress to repeal or modify various provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
352915_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Given these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made.
352915_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law.
352915_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
352915_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
352915_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in Note 1 to the financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following:
352915_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 35% of our net patient revenues during 2015, 38% during 2014 and 39% during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 52 % of our net patient revenues durin g 2015, 50% during 2014 and 49% during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P20_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_16_ITEM7_P20_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_16_ITEM7_P20_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_16_ITEM7_P20_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P20_S7	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_16_ITEM7_P20_S8	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of December 31, 2015, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.
352915_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_16_ITEM7_P24_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_16_ITEM7_P24_S6	Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_16_ITEM7_P24_S7	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_16_ITEM7_P24_S8	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_16_ITEM7_P24_S9	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_16_ITEM7_P24_S10	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states.
352915_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration.
352915_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned.
352915_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered.
352915_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	reg istration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible.
352915_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for se rvices provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient s Medicaid eligibility.
352915_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	When the patient s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which imp acts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending.
352915_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	Although the patient s ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from pe riod to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2015, 2014 or 2013 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
352915_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in uninsured discounts amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_16_ITEM7_P29_S4	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable.
352915_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	Effective January 1, 2014, in response to market conditions and other considerations, we modified our uninsured discount policy and increased the discount to 60% of gross charges from 30% previously.
352915_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	Since we expect to collect only a small portion of amounts due from our uninsured patients, the increase in the uninsured discount as of January 1, 2014 had no material impact on our 2015 and 2014 net revenues, net income attributable to UHS or net accounts receivable, as compared to 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P30_S4	However, this change resulted in an increase in uninsured discounts and a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts.
352915_16_ITEM7_P30_S5	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $399 million and $325 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
352915_16_ITEM7_P30_S6	Approximately 85% during 2015 and 84% during 2014 of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our acute care hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM7_P30_S7	Shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of December 31, 2015 and 2014: As of December 31, 2015:
352915_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
352915_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	The regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
352915_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Medicare EHR incentive payments: Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent y ear.
352915_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Medicaid EHR incentive payments: Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria.
352915_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria.
352915_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	Upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods.
352915_16_ITEM7_P33_S4	Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria were included in other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_16_ITEM7_P34_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_16_ITEM7_P34_S5	In addition, we also: (i) own commercial health insurers headquartered in Reno, Nevada, and Puerto Rico and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_16_ITEM7_P34_S6	The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_16_ITEM7_P34_S7	Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P34_S8	See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Commitments and Contingencies , for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability, workers compensation liability and property insurance.
352915_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we changed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles testing date from September 1st to October 1st.
352915_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	Management believes that this voluntary change in accounting method is preferable as it aligns the annual impairment testing date with our annual budgeting process.
352915_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	In connection with this change, we first performed an impairment test as of September 1, 2015, which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_16_ITEM7_P36_S5	We performed an additional impairment test as of October 1, 2015 which also indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_16_ITEM7_P36_S6	There were also no impairments during 2014 or 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P36_S7	The 2015 change in annual testing date does not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge.
352915_16_ITEM7_P36_S8	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	See Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates below for discussion of our effective tax rates during each of the last three years.
352915_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements: For a summary of recent accounting prono uncements, please see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Accounting Standards as included in this Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The following table summarizes our results of operations, and is used in the discussion below, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014:
352915_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	Net revenues increased 10% or $838 million to $9.04 billion during 2015 as compared to $8.21 billion during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	The increase was primarily attributable to:
352915_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	other combined net increase of $286 million consisting primarily of: (i) the revenues generated at 21 behavioral health care facilities acquired in the U.K. since September of 2014; (ii) a full year of revenues generated at a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada, that was acquired in June, 2014, and; (iii) the revenues generated at the 4 inpatient facilities and 8 outpatient centers acquired in October, 2015 as part of our acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network, LLC.
352915_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $216 million to $1.15 billion during 2015 as compared to $930 million during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	Included in our income before income taxes during 2015, as compared to 2014, was the following:
352915_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	$9 million of other combined net decreases.
352915_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Net income attributable to UHS increased $135 million to $681 million during 2015 as compared to $545 million during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	a decrease of $71 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from the income tax provision on the $206 million increase in pre-tax income ($216 million increase in income before income taxes less the $10 million decrease in income resulting from an increase in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests).
352915_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013:
352915_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	Net revenues increased 11% or $837 million to $8.21 billion during 2014 as compared to $7.37 billion during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	The increase was primarily attributable to:
352915_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	other combined net increase of $280 million consisting primarily of the net revenues generated during 2014 related to acquisitions made during the year including: (i) a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada; (ii) the behavioral health facilities located in the U.K. acquired as part of our acquisition of Cygnet Health Care Limited, and; (iii) a 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center located in Washington, D.C.
352915_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	Also contributing to the increase in net revenues was a full year of net revenues generated during 2014 at Temecula Valley Hospital, a 140-bed, newly constructed acute care facility that was completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $60 million to $930 million during 2014 as compared to $869 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	Included in our income before income taxes during 2014, as compared to 2013, was the following:
352915_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	$37 million of other combined net decreases.
352915_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Net income attributable to UHS increased $35 million to $545 million during 2014 as compared to $511 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	a decrease of $9 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from: (i) the income tax provision on the $44 million increase in pre-tax income ($60 million increase in income before income taxes less the $16 million decrease in income resulting from an increase in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests), partially offset by; (ii) the income tax provision recorded during 2013 on the sale of Peak Behavioral Health Services (the tax basis gain realized on the sale in 2013 exceeded the gain recorded pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles), and; (iii) a decrease during 2014, as compared to 2013, to our blended effective state income tax rate.
352915_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	We believe that providing our results on a Same Facility basis, which includes the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance.
352915_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	Our Same Facility results also neutralize the impact of the EHR applications, the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.
352915_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	Our Same Facility basis results reflected on the tables below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below Sources of Revenue-Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P53_S3	However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under All Acute Care Hospitals .
352915_16_ITEM7_P53_S4	The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses.
352915_16_ITEM7_P53_S5	The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	On a same facility basis during 2015, as compared to 2014, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $357 million or 9%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	Income before income taxes increased $79 million or 17% to $543 million or 12.2% of net revenues during 2015 as compared to $464 million or 11.3% of net revenues during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	Inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 4.2% during 2015, as compared to 2014, while patient days increased 4.4%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P54_S3	Adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 5.4% and adjusted patient days increased 5.5% during 2015, as compared to 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P54_S4	The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.7 days during 2015 and 4.6 days during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P54_S5	The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 59% during 2015 and 58% during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P54_S6	On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 3.9% during 2015, as compared to 2014, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.7% during 2015, as compared to 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	All Acute Care Hospitals Services The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2015 and 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	These amounts include: (i) our acute care results on a same facility basis, as indicated above; (ii) the impact of the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals; (iii) the operating results of a commercial health insurer acquired in June of 2014 (the operating results for the periods of June through December of 2015 and 2014 are also included in the same facility basis results reflected above); (iv) the impact of provider tax assessments which increased net revenues and other operating expenses but had no impact on income before income taxes, and; (v) certain other amounts.
352915_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	Dollar amounts below are reflected in thousands.
352915_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	During 2015, as compared to 2014, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $454 million or 11% to $4.63 billion due primarily to: (i) a $357 million, or 9%, increase same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) other combined net increase of $97 million consisting primarily of a full year of revenues related to a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada, that was acquired in June of 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Income before income taxes increased $54 million to $520 million or 11.2% of net revenues during 2015 as compared to $465 million or 11.1% of net revenues during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	Included in these results are the following:
352915_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	a net other combined decrease of $2 million.
352915_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Uncompensated care (charity care and uninsured discounts):
352915_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:
352915_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	The provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals was approximately $631 million during 2015, $590 million during 2014 and $1.02 billion during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	The decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts during 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to the increase in the uninsured discount (effective January 1, 2014, as discussed above in Charity Care, Uninsured discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts) , and reclassifications among provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending based upon our patients ultimate eligibility determination, as discussed above.
352915_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	On a same facility basis during 2014, as compared to 2013, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $355 million or 10%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	Income before income taxes increased $207 million or 75% to $484 million or 12.3% of net revenues during 2014 as compared to $277 million or 7.8% of net revenues during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	The increased income before income taxes experienced at our acute care facilities during 2014, as compared to 2013, was due in part to improved general economic conditions as well as a decrease in the number of uninsured patients treated at our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM7_P64_S3	The decrease in the number of uninsured patients treated at our acute care hospitals was due primarily to the favorable impact of the Affordable Care Act which included the expansion of Medicaid in certain states in which we operate and the enrollment of patients in newly created commercial exchanges.
352915_16_ITEM7_P64_S4	Inpatient admissions to these facilities increased 0.6% during 2014, as compared to 2013, while patient days increased 3.9%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P64_S5	Adjusted admissions increased 3.1% and adjusted patient days increased 6.5% during 2014, as compared to 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P64_S6	The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.7 days during 2014 and 4.5 days during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	avai lable beds at these facilities, was 58% during 2014 and 56% during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 6.6% during 2014, as compared to 2013, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.
352915_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	3% during 2014, as compared to 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P65_S3	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2014 and 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P65_S4	These amounts include our acute care results on a same facility basis (as indicated above), the impact of provider tax assessments which increased net revenues and other operating expenses but had no impact on income before income taxes, as well as the impact of other items as mentioned below (dollar amounts in thousands).
352915_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	During 2014, as compared to 2013, net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased $575 million or 16% to $4.18 billion due primarily to: (i) a $355 million, or 10%, increase same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) other combined net increase of $220 million consisting primarily of the net revenues generated during 2014 related to the acquisition of a commercial health insurer and a full year of net revenues generated during 2014 at Temecula Valley Hospital, a 140-bed acute care facility that was completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	Income before income taxes increased $123 million to $465 million or 11.1% of net revenues during 2014 as compared to $342 million or 9.5% of net revenues during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	Included in these results are the following:
352915_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	a net other combined decrease of $5 million consisting primarily of the decreased operating losses incurred at a Temecula Valley Hospital, offset by the operating losses incurred at a commercial health insurer acquired during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Behavioral Health Care Services Year Ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Behavioral Health Care Facilities-Same Facility Basis Our same facility basis results which include the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year period, neutralize the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.
352915_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	Our same facility basis results reflected on the tables below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below Sources of Revenue-Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under All Behavioral Health Care Facilities .
352915_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses.
352915_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for our behavioral health care facilities, on a same facility basis, and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in thousands):

352915_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our behavioral health care facilities during 2015 and 2014 which includes our behavioral health results on a same facility basis, the impact of the facilities acquired or opened within the previous twelve months, and the impact of provider tax assessments which increased net revenues and other operating expenses but had no impact on income before income taxes (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	During 2015, as compared to 2014, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities increased 10% or $388 million to $4.40 billion during 2015 as compared to $4.01 billion during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	The increase in net revenues was attributable to: (i) $195 million or 5% increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) $193 million of other combined increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at the 21 behavioral health care facilities acquired in the U.K. since September of 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	Income before income taxes increased $78 million or 8% to $1.02 billion or 23.2% of net revenues during 2015 as compared to $944 million or 23.5% of net revenues during 2014.

352915_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our behavioral health care facilities during 2014 and 2013 which includes our behavioral health results on a same facility basis, the impact of the facilities acquired or opened within the previous twelve months, the impact of the other items mentioned below and the impact of provider tax assessments which increased net revenues and other operating expenses but had no impact on income before income taxes (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	During 2014, as compared to 2013, net revenues at our behavioral health care facilities increased 8% or $287 million to $4.01 billion during 2014 as compared to $3.73 billion during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	The increase in net revenues was attributable to: (i) a $202 million or 6% increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) $76 million of other combined net increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at the facilities acquired during 2014 including the behavioral health facilities located in the U.K. and a 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center located in Washington, D.C,.
352915_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	Income before income taxes increased $48 million or 5% to $944 million or 23.5% of net revenues during 2014 as compared to $896 million or 24.0% of net revenues during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P77_S3	The increase in income before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to:
352915_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	a $1 million other combined net increase.
352915_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	Sources of Revenue Overview: We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services.
352915_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital.
352915_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.
352915_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis.
352915_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.
352915_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage.
352915_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year.
352915_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue.
352915_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts.
352915_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	The following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years for: (i) our Acute Care and Behavioral Health Care Facilities Combined; (ii) our Acute Care Facilities, and; (iii) our Behavioral Health Care Facilities.
352915_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.
352915_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease.
352915_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.
352915_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge.
352915_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s Medicare severity diagnosis related group ( MS-DRG ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P86_S3	Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis.
352915_16_ITEM7_P86_S4	The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care.
352915_16_ITEM7_P86_S5	This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG.
352915_16_ITEM7_P86_S6	The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity.
352915_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patient s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a sp ecified threshold.
352915_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1.
352915_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the hospital market basket index, gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services.
352915_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	In July, 2015, CMS published its IPPS 2016 final payment rule which provides for a 2.4% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_16_ITEM7_P88_S4	Hospital ( DSH ) payment changes and decrease to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 1.1%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P88_S5	This projected impact from the IPPS 2016 final rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as discussed below.
352915_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	In August, 2014, CMS published its IPPS 2015 payment rule which provides for a 2.9% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required DSH payment changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 0.6%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	Including the estimated decreases to our DSH payments ( 1.9%) and Medicare Outlier threshold ( 0.6%), we estimate our overall decrease from the IPPS 2015 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015) will approximate ( 1.9%), or approximately $13 million annually.
352915_16_ITEM7_P89_S3	This projected impact from the IPPS 2015 rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.
352915_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	In August, 2013, CMS published its final IPPS 2014 payment rule which provided for a 2.5% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2014 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014) approximated 1.0%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	This projected impact from the IPPS 2014 final rule includes both the impact of the ATRA of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.
352915_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	The final rule also expands CMS s policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard.
352915_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	Specifically, it would require Medicare s external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services for at least two midnights (the Two Midnight rule).
352915_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	Correspondingly, under the final rule, CMS presumes that hospital services spanning less than two midnights should have been provided on an outpatient basis and paid under Medicare Part B unless the medical record contains clear documentation supporting the physician s order and an expectation that the Medicare beneficiary would need medically necessary care for more than two midnights, or is receiving services which CMS designates as inpatient only.
352915_16_ITEM7_P91_S3	Our acute care hospitals have begun to comply with the Two Midnight rule and, although we are unable to determine the ultimate impact at this time, its application could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P91_S4	Excluding the potential impact of the Two Midnight rule, the final IPPS 2014 payment rule did not have a material impact on our results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	In April, 2015, Congress voted to extend an enforcement moratorium on the Two Midnight rule through the end of fiscal year 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	Although the prohibition of recovery auditor patient status reviews expired on October 1, 2015, CMS did not approve recovery auditors to conduct patient status reviews for admission dates through December 31, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	A benefit on a case-by case basis for rare and unusual exceptions based the presence of certain clinical factors.
352915_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	CMS also announced in the final rule that, effective October 1, 2015, Quality Improvement Organizations ( QIOs ) will conduct reviews of short inpatient stay reviews rather than Medicare Administrative Contractors ( MACs ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P93_S2	Additionally, CMS also announced that RACs resumed patient status reviews for claims with admission dates of January 1, 2016 or later, and the agency indicates that RACs will conduct these reviews focused on providers with high denial rates that are referred by the QIOs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bip artisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_16_ITEM7_P94_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an ag reement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year .
352915_16_ITEM7_P94_S4	The Bipartis an Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, continued the 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 Act.
352915_16_ITEM7_P94_S5	For federal fiscal year 2015, the aggregate annual sequestration reduction to our Medicare net revenues was approximately $36 million with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P94_S6	On January 2, 2013 ATRA was enacted which, among other things, includes a requirement for CMS to recoup $11 billion from hospitals from Medicare IPPS rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017.
352915_16_ITEM7_P94_S7	The recoupment relates to IPPS documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by CMS.
352915_16_ITEM7_P94_S8	Both the 2014 and 2015 IPPS final rules include a -0.8% recoupment adjustment.
352915_16_ITEM7_P94_S9	CMS has included the same 0.8% recoupment adjustment in fiscal year 2016 and expects to make similar adjustment in federal fiscal year 2017 in order to recover the entire $11 billion.
352915_16_ITEM7_P94_S10	This adjustment is reflected in the 2014, 2015 and 2016 IPPS estimated impact amounts noted above.
352915_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	On April 16, 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted and an anticipated 3.2% payment increase in 2018 is scheduled to be phased in at 0.5% per year over 6 years beginning in fiscal year 2018.
352915_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	On January 1, 2005, CMS implemented a new Psychiatric Prospective Payment System ( Psych PPS ) for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program.
352915_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	This system replaced the cost-based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem Psych PPS with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics.
352915_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	The Psych PPS also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department.
352915_16_ITEM7_P96_S3	In August, 2012, CMS published its final Psych PPS rate notice for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2012.
352915_16_ITEM7_P96_S4	That final notice contained a Psych PPS market basket update of 2.7%, which was reduced by 0.7% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and reduced by 0.1% to reflect an other adjustment required by the Social Security Act for rate years 2010 through 2019.
352915_16_ITEM7_P96_S5	In July, 2013, CMS released its final Psych PPS rate notice for the federal fiscal year 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P96_S6	The final notice contains a Psych PPS market basket update of 2.6% which is reduced by 0.5% to reflect a productivity adjustment, and reduced by 0.1% to reflect an other adjustment required by the Social Security Act.
352915_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	In July, 2015, CMS published it Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2016.
352915_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 1.7% compared to federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P97_S2	This amount includes the effect of the 2.4% market basket update less a 0.2% adjustment as required by the Affordable Care Act and a 0.5% productivity adjustment.
352915_16_ITEM7_P97_S3	The final rule also updates the Inpatient Psychiatric Quality Reporting Program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update.
352915_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	On July 31, 2014, CMS published it Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 2.1% compared to federal fiscal year 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P98_S2	This amount includes the effect of the 2.9% market basket update adjusted by the Affordable Care Act required 0.3% reduction and the -0.5% productivity adjustment.
352915_16_ITEM7_P98_S3	The final rule also updates the Inpatient Psychiatric Quality Reporting Program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update.
352915_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	In October, 2015, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2016.
352915_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	The hospital market basket increase is 2.4%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P99_S2	The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2016 OPPS market basket.
352915_16_ITEM7_P99_S3	Additionally, CMS also proposes a reduction of 2.0%, which the CMS claims is necessary to eliminate $1 billion in excess laboratory payments that CMS packaged into OPPS payment rates in 2014 resulting in a 2016 OPPS market basket update at -0.3%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P99_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2016 will aggregate to a net decrease of -0.2% which includes a 7.0% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates.
352915_16_ITEM7_P99_S5	When the behavioral health division s partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, we estimate that our Medicare 2016 OPPS payments will result in -1.6% decrease in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	In October, 2014, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	The hospital market basket increase is 2.9%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2015 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2015 OPPS market basket update at 2.2%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P100_S3	In the final rule, CMS will reduce the 2015 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P100_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS for 2015 will aggregate to a net increase of 0.2%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P100_S5	Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2015 is estimated to be 1.5%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care.
352915_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	Most state Medicaid payments are mad e under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM7_P101_S2	Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_16_ITEM7_P101_S3	In addition to rev enues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid.
352915_16_ITEM7_P101_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers a re certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_16_ITEM7_P101_S5	We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $90 million annually from each of Texas, Washington, D.C., California, Nevada, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Massachusetts and Florida, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	The Affordable Care Act substantially increases the federally and state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	However, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of the Affordable Care Act requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding.
352915_16_ITEM7_P102_S2	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that states in which we operate will expand Medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level.
352915_16_ITEM7_P102_S3	Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments, as discussed below.
352915_16_ITEM7_P102_S4	We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	Texas and South Carolina Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a DSH adjustment.
352915_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments.
352915_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.
352915_16_ITEM7_P104_S2	Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas and South Carolina s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state s DSH fund.
352915_16_ITEM7_P104_S3	The South Carolina and Texas DSH programs were renewed for each state s 2016 DSH fiscal year (covering the period of October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016).
352915_16_ITEM7_P104_S4	During the second quarter of 2015, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission ( THHSC ) finalized DSH payments for federal fiscal year 2014 which resulted in a $6 million annualized reduction in our Texas Medicaid DSH payments retroactive to October, 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P104_S5	In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $36 million during 2015, $49 million during 2014 and $54 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P104_S6	We expect reimbursements to our hospitals, pursuant to the 2016 fiscal year programs for Texas and South Carolina, to be at amounts similar to each state s 2015 fiscal year amounts.
352915_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	The Affordable Care Act and subsequent federal legislation provides for a significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2018 (see below in Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid Revisions for additional disclosure).
352915_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology.
352915_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in Texas and South Carolina, will likely be reduced in the coming years.
352915_16_ITEM7_P106_S2	We are unable to estimate the impact of this federally required reduction at this time.
352915_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs: We incur health-care related taxes ( Provider Taxes ) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services.
352915_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments.
352915_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	Under these programs, including the impact of Uncompensated Care and Upper Payment Limit programs, and the Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive program, we earned revenues (before Provider Taxes) of approximately $307 million during 2015, $295 million during 2014 and $213 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P108_S2	These revenues were offset by Provider Taxes of $137 million during 2015, $140 million during 2014 and $84 million during 2013, which are recorded in other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income as included herein.
352915_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	Texas Uncompensated Care/Upper Payment Limit Payments:
352915_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hidalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in Medicaid supplemental payment Section 1115 Waiver indigent care programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	Section 1115 Waiver Uncompensated Care ( UC ) payments replace the former Upper Payment Limit ( UPL ) payments.
352915_16_ITEM7_P110_S2	These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties.
352915_16_ITEM7_P110_S3	Our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM7_P110_S4	The supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer ( IGT ) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM7_P110_S5	However, the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any IGT on the amount of any private hospital s indigent care obligation.
352915_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	During the second quarter of 2015, THHSC finalized the UC for federal fiscal year 2014 which resulted in an annualized $3 million increase in UC payments retroactive to October 1, 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P111_S1	We recorded net revenues/benefit from UC and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of $61 million (net of Provider Taxes of $8 million) during 2015, $68 million (net of Provider Taxes of $17 million) during 2014 and $61 million (net of Provider Taxes of $10 million) during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P111_S2	In April, 2015, THHSC published a final rule that would shift $136 million in funding from the private hospital UC pool to the large public hospital UC pool for the 2014 UC program year only.
352915_16_ITEM7_P111_S3	The impact from this final rule is incorporated into 2014 and 2015 UC amounts, as mentioned above.
352915_16_ITEM7_P111_S4	If the applicable hospital district or county makes IGTs consistent with 2015 levels, we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net revenues/benefit earned pursuant to these programs of approximately $55 million (net of Provider Taxes of $10 million) during 2016.
352915_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	On September 30, 2014, CMS notified the Texas Health and Human Services Commission that it was deferring the federal matching funds (approximately $75 million) on Texas Medicaid UC payments made to providers in certain counties.
352915_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	A deferral results in CMS withholding funds from the state representing the federal portion of Medicaid payments the state has previously made to providers.
352915_16_ITEM7_P112_S2	A deferral goes into effect when CMS questions the basis for all or part of the amount of Medicaid payments made to certain providers, and remains in place subject to CMS s final determination.
352915_16_ITEM7_P112_S3	Our Texas hospitals are not located in the geographic areas impacted by this deferral.
352915_16_ITEM7_P112_S4	On January 7, 2015, CMS removed the aforementioned deferral but indicated they will continue their review and assessment of the underlying UC financing arrangements as to ensure their compliance with the applicable federal regulations and eligibility for federal matching dollars.
352915_16_ITEM7_P112_S5	In May, 2015, THHSC was informed by CMS that current private-hospital funding arrangements can continue for waiver-payment dates through August, 2017, without risk of disallowance of federal matching funds on the same grounds questioned in last year s deferral.
352915_16_ITEM7_P112_S6	For state fiscal year 2016, Texas Medicaid will continue to operate under a CMS-approved Section 1115 five-year Medicaid waiver demonstration program.
352915_16_ITEM7_P112_S7	During the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012, the THHSC transitioned away from UPL payments to new waiver incentive payment programs, UC payments and Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments ( DSRIP ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P112_S8	During the first year of transition, which commenced on October 1, 2011, THHSC made payments to Medicaid UPL recipient providers that received payments during the state s prior fiscal year.
352915_16_ITEM7_P112_S9	During demonstration years two through five (October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2016), THHSC has, and will continue to, make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM7_P112_S10	Supplemental payments are also subject to aggregate statewide caps based on CMS approved Medicaid waiver amounts.
352915_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments: In addition, the Texas Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver includes a DSRIP pool to incentivize hospitals and other providers to transform their service delivery practices to improve quality, health status, patient experience, coordination, and cost-effectiveness.
352915_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	DSRIP pool payments are incentive payments to hospitals and other providers that develop programs or strategies to enhance access to health care, increase the quality of care, the cost-effectiveness of care provided and the health of the patients and families served.
352915_16_ITEM7_P113_S2	In May, 2014, CMS formally approved specific DSRIP projects for certain of our hospitals for demonstration years 3 to 5 (our facilities did not materially participate in the DSRIP pool during demonstration years 1 or 2).
352915_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	DSRIP payments are contingent on the hospital meeting certain pre-determined milestones, metrics and clinical outcomes.
352915_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	Additionally, DSRIP payments are contingent on a governmental entity providing an IGT for the non-federal share component of the DSRIP payment.
352915_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	THHSC generally approves DSRIP reported metrics, milestones and clinical outcomes on a semi-annual basis in June and December.
352915_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	We recorded net DSRIP revenues/benefit of approximately $24 million (net of Provider Taxes of $15 million) during 2015 and $17 million (net of Provider Taxes of $8 million) during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P115_S2	There were no DSRIP revenues/benefit recorded during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P115_S3	Although we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for additional DSRIP revenues, subject to CMS s approval and other conditions as outlined above, we estimate that we may be entitled to additional DSRIP revenues/benefit of approximately $25 million (net of Provider Taxes of $16 million) during 2016.
352915_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	Nevada SPA: In Nevada, CMS approved a state plan amendment ( SPA ) in August, 2014 that implemented a hospital supplemental payment program retroactive to January 1, 2014 and effective to June 30, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	supplemental payment program retroactive to July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016.
352915_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	Included in o ur results of operations during 2015 and 2014 were approximately $10 million and $12 million, respectively, of net revenues earned in connection with this program .
352915_16_ITEM7_P117_S2	We estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to these programs will approximate $10 million during 2016.
352915_16_ITEM7_P117_S3	Various Other State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs: Including the impact of the programs in various states applicable to each year, and excluding the impact of various programs in Texas and the Nevada SPA, as discussed above, we earned an aggregate net revenues/benefit from Medicaid supplemental payments of approximately $86 million (net of Provider Taxes of $113 million) during 2015, $71 million (net of Provider Taxes of $115 million) during 2014 and $69 million (net of Provider Taxes of $74 million) during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P117_S4	We estimate that our aggregate net revenues/benefit from Provider Tax programs will approximate $80 million (net of Provider Taxes of $126 million) during 2016.
352915_16_ITEM7_P117_S5	These amounts include the impact of the CMS approved California Provider Tax and related Medicaid supplemental payment programs, which did not have a material impact on our operating results.
352915_16_ITEM7_P117_S6	The aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P117_S7	However, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	As outlined above, we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	Failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental Medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	HITECH Act: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria.
352915_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P120_S2	State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate.
352915_16_ITEM7_P120_S3	Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria.
352915_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	The government s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.
352915_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	Pursuant to HITECH Act regulations, hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 were subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	All of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore were not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P122_S2	However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.
352915_16_ITEM7_P122_S3	No reduction is expected for federal fiscal year 2016.
352915_16_ITEM7_P122_S4	Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P122_S5	Our 2015 consolidated results of operations includes an unfavorable pre-tax impact of approximately $18 million consisting of approximately $16 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $37 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $3 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.
352915_16_ITEM7_P122_S6	Our 2014 consolidated results of operations includes an unfavorable pre-tax impact of approximately $8 million consisting of approximately $28 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $37 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.
352915_16_ITEM7_P122_S7	Our 2013 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pre-tax impact of approximately $19 million consisting of approximately $61 million of EHR incentive income less approximately $10 million of salaries, wages, benefits and other operating expenses, approximately $33 million of depreciation and amortization expense, plus approximately $1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests.
352915_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P123_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow.
352915_16_ITEM7_P124_S1	The conseq uent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate.
352915_16_ITEM7_P124_S2	Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.
352915_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance.
352915_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy.
352915_16_ITEM7_P125_S2	Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.
352915_16_ITEM7_P125_S3	Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services.
352915_16_ITEM7_P125_S4	To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage.
352915_16_ITEM7_P126_S1	Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy.
352915_16_ITEM7_P126_S2	Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.
352915_16_ITEM7_P126_S3	Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:
352915_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future.
352915_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the Reconciliation Act ) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the Affordable Care Act ), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs.
352915_16_ITEM7_P129_S1	Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.
352915_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	The Affordable Care Act implemented certain reforms to Medicare Advantage payments, effective in 2011.
352915_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	A Medicare shared savings program, effective in 2012.
352915_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	A hospital readmissions reduction program, effective in 2012.
352915_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	A value-based purchasing program for hospitals, effective in 2012.
352915_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	A national pilot program on payment bundling, effective in 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	Reduction to Medicare disproportionate share hospital ( DSH ) payments, effective in 2014, as discussed above.
352915_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments, effective in 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	The Affordable Care Act (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal DSH funding from federal fiscal year ( FFY ) 2018 through FFY 2025.
352915_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	The aggregate annual reduction amounts are:
352915_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	$5.0 billion for FFY 2021 $6.0 billion for FFY 2022 $7.0 billion for FFY 2023 $8.0 billion for FFY 2024 $8.0 billion for FFY 2025 Health Insurance Revisions:
352915_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	Large employer insurance reforms, effective in 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P140_S0	Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies, effective in 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms, effective in 2010 and forward.
352915_16_ITEM7_P142_S0	The Affordable Care Act seeks to increase competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state insurance exchanges.
352915_16_ITEM7_P142_S1	The Affordable Care Act also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health status, gender, or other specified factors.
352915_16_ITEM7_P142_S2	We cannot provide assurance that these provisions will not adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for services provided to insured patients, or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward.
352915_16_ITEM7_P143_S0	Value-Based Purchasing: There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services.
352915_16_ITEM7_P143_S1	These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities.
352915_16_ITEM7_P144_S0	Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates.
352915_16_ITEM7_P144_S1	In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events.
352915_16_ITEM7_P144_S2	Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.
352915_16_ITEM7_P145_S0	The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing.
352915_16_ITEM7_P146_S0	The Affordable Care Act prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions ( HAC ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P146_S1	Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments.
352915_16_ITEM7_P146_S2	Additionally, hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.
352915_16_ITEM7_P146_S3	The Affordable Care Act also required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012.
352915_16_ITEM7_P146_S4	The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in FFY 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years.
352915_16_ITEM7_P146_S5	HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS.
352915_16_ITEM7_P146_S6	HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions.
352915_16_ITEM7_P146_S7	In its fiscal year 2016 IPPS final rule, CMS will fund the value-based purchasing program by reducing base operating DRG payment amounts to participating hospitals by 1.75%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P147_S0	In the Affordable Care Act, Congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program ( HRRP ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P147_S1	The HRRP assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates when compared to expected rates, effective for discharges beginning October 1, 2012.
352915_16_ITEM7_P147_S2	In the fiscal year 2013 IPPS final rule, CMS finalized certain policies with regard to payment under the HRRP, including which hospitals are subject to the HRRP, the methodology to calculate the hospital readmission payment adjustment factor, and what portion of the IPPS payment is used to calculate the readmission adjustment factor.
352915_16_ITEM7_P147_S3	In the fiscal year 2014 IPPS final rule, CMS finalized revisions to the three 30-day admission measures in the program heart failure, myocardial infarction, and pneumonia to exclude planned readmissions.
352915_16_ITEM7_P148_S0	Under the Affordable Care Act, beginning in fiscal year 2015, the maximum reduction in payments under the HRRP will increase from 2% to 3%.
352915_16_ITEM7_P149_S0	arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
352915_16_ITEM7_P150_S0	In the fiscal year 2015 IPPS final rule, CMS added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017.
352915_16_ITEM7_P151_S0	The impact of HRRP for federal fiscal year 2015 did not have a material adverse effect on our results of op erations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P152_S0	The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations ( ACOs ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P152_S1	The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services.
352915_16_ITEM7_P152_S2	The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency.
352915_16_ITEM7_P152_S3	ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.
352915_16_ITEM7_P153_S0	In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities.
352915_16_ITEM7_P153_S1	The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions.
352915_16_ITEM7_P153_S2	We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments.
352915_16_ITEM7_P153_S3	Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.
352915_16_ITEM7_P153_S4	Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_16_ITEM7_P153_S5	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM7_P153_S6	Other Operating Results Combined net revenues and income/losses before income taxes from our surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2015, 2014 or 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P153_S7	Interest Expense Below is a schedule of our interest expense during 2015, 2014 and 2013 (amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM7_P154_S0	In August, 2014, we entered into a fourth amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended.
352915_16_ITEM7_P154_S1	The credit agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to expire in August, 2019, consists of: (i ) an $800 million revolving credit facility, and; (ii) a $1.775 billion Term Loan A facility, which combined our previously outstanding term loan A and term loan A2 facilities (which were scheduled to mature in 2016).
352915_16_ITEM7_P154_S2	Interest rates were not impacted by t he fourth amendment to the credit agreement.
352915_16_ITEM7_P154_S3	The Term Loan B-1 facility was repaid in August, 2014, utilizing other borrowed funds.
352915_16_ITEM7_P155_S0	In July, 2014, we redeemed the entire $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due in 2018.
352915_16_ITEM7_P155_S1	An $11 million make-whole premium was paid in connection with this early extinguishment.
352915_16_ITEM7_P156_S0	In December, 2015, we amended our existing accounts receivable securitization program, which was scheduled to expire in October, 2016, to extend the term through December 21, 2018 and increase the borrowing limit to $400 million from $360 million.
352915_16_ITEM7_P157_S0	In May, 2013 we completed a third amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended.
352915_16_ITEM7_P157_S1	The third amendment provided for a reduction in the interest rates payable in connection with certain borrowings outstanding at that time under the credit agreement.
352915_16_ITEM7_P157_S2	Specifically, we replaced our then outstanding $745.9 million senior secured term loan B with a new senior secured term loan B1 in the same amount on substantially the same terms as the term loan B, other than lower interest rates.
352915_16_ITEM7_P158_S0	Interest expense decreased $20 million during 2015 to $113 million as compared to $134 million during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P158_S1	The decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $3 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program due primarily to a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings as well as a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities, as discussed below; (ii) a $9 million decrease in interest rate swap expense, resulting primarily from the 2015 maturities of our previously outstanding interest rate swaps, and; (iii) an $8 million decrease in amortization and financing fees, resulting primarily from the write-off of certain deferred financing costs and original issue discounts in connection with various financing transactions that occurred during the third quarter of 2014, as discussed above.
352915_16_ITEM7_P158_S2	Interest expense decreased $12 million during 2014 to $134 million as compared to $146 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P158_S3	The decrease was due primarily to: (i) a $16 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program due primarily to a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings as well as a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities, as discussed below; (ii) a $6 million decrease in the amortization of financing fees, resulting primarily from the write-off of certain deferred financing costs and original issue discounts in connections with the financing transactions during the third quarter of 2014, as discussed above, offset by; (iii) $5 million of capitalized interest recorded on major projects during 2013, and; (iv) a $5 million decrease in interest income, primarily related to the interest income received from Illinois during 2013 related to delayed cash remittances to us.
352915_16_ITEM7_P158_S4	The aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program were approximately $3.1 billion during 2015, $3.2 billion during 2014 and $3.5 billion during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P158_S5	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 2.9% during each of 2015 and 2014 and 3.1% during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P158_S6	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 3.4% during 2015, 3.9% during 2014 and 4.2% during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P158_S7	In connection with various financing transactions completed during 2014, as discussed below in Capital Resources-Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities, our 2014 results of operations include a $36 million pre-tax charge incurred for the costs related to the extinguishment of debt.
352915_16_ITEM7_P158_S8	This charge consisted of the write-off of deferred charges ($20 million) and original issue discount on the extinguished debt ($5 million) as well as the make-whole premium paid ($11 million) on the early redemption of the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes.
352915_16_ITEM7_P158_S9	There were no costs related to early extinguishment of debt incurred during 2015 or 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P159_S0	Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM7_P160_S0	Outside owners hold various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in seven of our acute care facilities and one behavioral health care facility.
352915_16_ITEM7_P160_S1	Each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies ( LLC ) or limited partnerships ( LP ).
352915_16_ITEM7_P160_S2	As a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit.
352915_16_ITEM7_P160_S3	When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members /partners share of the income generated by the joint-venture entities.
352915_16_ITEM7_P161_S0	In addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners.
352915_16_ITEM7_P161_S1	The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM7_P162_S0	The impact of the discrete tax items did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes during 2015, 2014 or 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P162_S1	The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2015, as compared to 2014, was due primarily to lower effective income tax rates applicable to the income generated during 2015 at the behavioral health care facilities located in the U.K. that were acquired since the third quarter of 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P162_S2	The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2014, as compared to 2013, was due primarily to: (i) a decrease in our blended effective state income tax rate during 2014; (ii) the income tax provision recorded during 2013 on the sale of Peak Behavioral Health Services which was divested in May, 2013 (the tax basis gain realized on the sale of Peak Behavioral Health Services exceeded the gain recorded pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles), and; (iii) a decrease to our federal income tax provision relating to 2013 that was recorded during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P163_S0	We consider the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
352915_16_ITEM7_P163_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $49 million and $12 million, respectively.
352915_16_ITEM7_P163_S2	Discontinued Operations There were no material divestitures during 2015 or 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P164_S0	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services ( Peak ), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
352915_16_ITEM7_P164_S1	The divestiture of Peak was completed during the second quarter of 2013 for total cash proceeds of approximately $24 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million which is included in our 2013 consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM7_P165_S0	The following table shows the results of operations for Peak, which was reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership during 2013 (amounts i n thousands).
352915_16_ITEM7_P165_S1	Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.
352915_16_ITEM7_P166_S0	Effects of Inflation and Seasonality Seasonality Our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_16_ITEM7_P166_S1	This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.
352915_16_ITEM7_P167_S0	Inflation Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years.
352915_16_ITEM7_P167_S1	However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases.
352915_16_ITEM7_P167_S2	Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices.
352915_16_ITEM7_P167_S3	We believe, however, that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.
352915_16_ITEM7_P168_S0	Liquidity Year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014:
352915_16_ITEM7_P168_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.021 billion during 2015 as compared to $1.036 billion during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P168_S2	The net decrease of $15 million was primarily attributable to the following:
352915_16_ITEM7_P169_S0	$8 million of other combined net favorable changes.
352915_16_ITEM7_P170_S0	Days sales outstanding ( DSO ): Our DSO are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the year.
352915_16_ITEM7_P170_S1	The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance the end of the year.
352915_16_ITEM7_P170_S2	Our DSO were 53 days at December 31, 2015, 57 days at December 31, 2014 and 55 days at December 31, 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P170_S3	Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $913 million during 2015 and $833 million during 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P171_S0	The $913 million of net cash used in investing activities during 2015 consisted of $534 million spent related to the acquisition of businesses and property, $379 million spent on capital expenditures, $3 million spent to increase inv estments of insurance subsidiary and, net of $3 million received from the sale of assets and businesses consisting primarily of divestiture of a small operator of behavioral health care services.
352915_16_ITEM7_P171_S1	2015 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2015 we spent $534 million to:
352915_16_ITEM7_P172_S0	various other businesses, a management contract and real property assets.

352915_16_ITEM7_P178_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.04 billion during 2014 as compared to $884 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P178_S2	The net increase of $152 million was primarily attributable to the following:
352915_16_ITEM7_P179_S0	$12 million of other combined net unfavorable changes.
352915_16_ITEM7_P180_S0	Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $833 million during 2014 and $383 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM7_P180_S1	The factors contributing to the $833 million of net cash used in investing activities during 2014 are detailed above.
352915_16_ITEM7_P180_S2	The $383 million of net cash used in investing activities during 2013 consisted of $358 million spent on capital expenditures, $13 million spent on the acquisition of property and businesses, $37 million received from the sale of assets and businesses and $50 million spent in connection with the purchase and implementation of an EHR application.

352915_16_ITEM7_P182_S0	generated $6 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans.
352915_16_ITEM7_P183_S0	2016 Expected Capital Expenditures: During 2016, we expect to spend approximately $400 million to $425 million on capital expenditures which includes expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities (Henderson Hospital).
352915_16_ITEM7_P183_S1	Approximately $165 million of our 2016 expected capital expenditures relates to completion of projects that are in progress as of December 31, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P183_S2	We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM7_P183_S3	We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below.
352915_16_ITEM7_P183_S4	During the third quarter of 2014, we completed the following financing transactions:
352915_16_ITEM7_P184_S0	Increased the borrowing capacity on our existing accounts receivable securitization program ( Securitization ) to $360 million from $275 million, effective August 1, 2014.
352915_16_ITEM7_P185_S0	In connection with these transactions, our 2014 results of operations included a $36 million pre-tax charge incurred for the costs related to the extinguishment of debt.
352915_16_ITEM7_P185_S1	This charge consisted of the write-off of deferred charges ($20 million) and original issue discount on the extinguished debt ($5 million) as well as the make-whole premium paid ($11 million) on the early redemption of the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes.
352915_16_ITEM7_P186_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the le nder s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings, or (2) the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolvin g credit and term loan-A borrowings.
352915_16_ITEM7_P186_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the applicable margins were 0.50% for ABR-based loans and 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan-A facilities.
352915_16_ITEM7_P187_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we had $300 million of borrowings outstanding pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility and we had $461 million of available borrowing capacity, net of $5 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to a short-term, on-demand credit facility and $34 million of outstanding letters of credit.
352915_16_ITEM7_P187_S1	The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit.
352915_16_ITEM7_P187_S2	The Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company (which generally excludes asset classes such as substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals, certain real estate assets and assets held in joint-ventures with third-parties) and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
352915_16_ITEM7_P187_S3	Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, term loan-A quarterly installment payments of approximately: (i) $11 million commenced during the fourth quarter of 2014 and are scheduled to continue through September, 2016, and; (ii) $22 million are scheduled from the fourth quarter of 2016 through June, 2019.
352915_16_ITEM7_P187_S4	As discussed above, in December, 2015, our Securitization with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks was amended to increase the borrowing capacity to $400 million from $360 million and extend the scheduled maturity date to December 21, 2018.
352915_16_ITEM7_P188_S0	Substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals ( Receivables ) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings.
352915_16_ITEM7_P188_S1	We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings.

352915_16_ITEM7_P188_S3	The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities.
352915_16_ITEM7_P188_S4	The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_16_ITEM7_P188_S5	The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans.

352915_16_ITEM7_P189_S4	Since we have the ability and intent to refinance the 7.125% Notes on or before the scheduled maturity date (June 30, 2016) either through the issuance of new long-term notes, a new long-term debt facility, or utilizing funds borrowed pursuant to our revolving credit facility, the 7.125% Notes are classified as long-term on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.

352915_16_ITEM7_P193_S4	However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_16_ITEM7_P193_S5	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

352915_16_ITEM7_P198_S2	In addition, we had various other projects under construction as of December 31, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P198_S3	Because we can terminate substantially all of the construction contracts related to the various other projects at any time without paying a termination fee, these costs are excluded from the above table except for the amount contractually committed to a third-party for Henderson Hospital.
352915_16_ITEM7_P199_S0	The aggregate estimated 2016 expenditures related to Henderson Hospital and the various other projects under construction as of December 31, 2015 is approximately $165 million.

352915_16_ITEM7_P204_S1	We exclude the $204 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments.
352915_16_ITEM7_P204_S2	Please see Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.
352915_16_ITEM7_P205_S0	In connection with five acute care facilities (and one additional facility currently under construction) located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain put rights that, if exercisable, and if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member s interests at fair market value.
352915_16_ITEM7_P205_S1	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.
352915_16_ITEM7_P206_S0	also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_16_ITEM7_P206_S1	If exercised, the put opti on requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_16_ITEM7_P206_S2	We exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these minority ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertai nty as to: (i) whether or not the put rights, if exercisable, will actually be exercised; (ii) the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were exercised, and; (iii) the timing of such payments.
352915_16_ITEM7_P206_S3	Additionally, the table above does not include $2 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7_P207_S0	Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be utilized.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2015 and 2014 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Seven interest rate swaps on a total notional amount of $825 million matured in May, 2015.

352915_16_ITEM7A_P9_S3	The fixed rate payable on this swap is 1.21%.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based on quotes from our counterparties.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P10_S2	We consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P11_S0	At December 31, 2015, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a net liability of $1 million comprised of a $5 million asset which is included in other assets offset by a $6 million liability which is included in other current liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P11_S1	At December 31, 2014, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of $6 million, all of which is included in other current liabilities.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P12_S0	The table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P12_S1	For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.
352915_16_ITEM7A_P13_S0	As calculated based upon our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015 that is subject to interest rate fluctuations, each 1% change in interest rates would impact our pre-tax income by approximately $18 million.
352915_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, together with the reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, are included elsewhere herein.
352915_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	Reference is made to the Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule.
352915_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2015, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
352915_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the SEC rules thereunder.
352915_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
352915_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report o n Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over our financial reporting.
352915_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria on Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
352915_16_ITEM9A_P2_S3	We have excluded the acquisitions made during 2015, including the facilities acquired as part of our acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network, LLC and Alpha Hospitals Holdings Limited, from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 because they were acquired by us in purchase business combinations at various times during 2015.
352915_16_ITEM9A_P2_S4	These facilities/businesses represented approximately 1% of our consolidated total assets and our consolidated net revenues as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Based on its assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the COSO.

352915_16_ITEM15_P12_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Health Services, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Universal Health Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
352915_16_ITEM15_P12_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P12_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_16_ITEM15_P12_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, financial statement schedule, and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Item 9A as Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
352915_16_ITEM15_P12_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
352915_16_ITEM15_P12_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
352915_16_ITEM15_P12_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
352915_16_ITEM15_P12_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
352915_16_ITEM15_P12_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
352915_16_ITEM15_P12_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
352915_16_ITEM15_P12_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
352915_16_ITEM15_P13_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_16_ITEM15_P13_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P13_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P13_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
352915_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting , management has excluded Foundations Recovery Network, LLC and Alpha Hospitals Holdings Limited from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 because the entities were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2015.
352915_16_ITEM15_P14_S1	We have also excluded Foundations Recovery Network, LLC and Alpha Hospitals Holdings Limited from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.

352915_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	The more significant accounting policies follow: A) Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner.
352915_16_ITEM15_P22_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
352915_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 35% of our net patient revenues during 2015, 38% during 2014 and 39% during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P23_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 52% of our net patient revenues during 2015, 50% during 2014 and 49% during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P23_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_16_ITEM15_P23_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_16_ITEM15_P23_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_16_ITEM15_P23_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P23_S7	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_16_ITEM15_P23_S8	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P24_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_16_ITEM15_P24_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P24_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_16_ITEM15_P24_S4	The vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom are derived from government based payors.
352915_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs, and the government based payor programs in the United Kingdom, are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future government based reimbursements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P25_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_16_ITEM15_P26_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	C) Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_16_ITEM15_P27_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_16_ITEM15_P27_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_16_ITEM15_P27_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_16_ITEM15_P27_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_16_ITEM15_P27_S6	Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_16_ITEM15_P27_S7	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_16_ITEM15_P27_S8	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	assistance inclu ding our charity care policy.
352915_16_ITEM15_P28_S1	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_16_ITEM15_P29_S1	Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_16_ITEM15_P30_S2	A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states.
352915_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration.
352915_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned.
352915_16_ITEM15_P31_S2	There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered.
352915_16_ITEM15_P31_S3	Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible.
352915_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient s Medicaid eligibility.
352915_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	When the patient s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending.
352915_16_ITEM15_P32_S2	Although the patient s ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2015, 2014 or 2013 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
352915_16_ITEM15_P32_S3	We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in uninsured discounts amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_16_ITEM15_P32_S4	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable.
352915_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_16_ITEM15_P33_S2	Effective January 1, 2014, in response to market conditions and other considerations, we modified our uninsured discount policy and increased the discount to 60% of gross charges from 30% previously.
352915_16_ITEM15_P33_S3	Since we expect to collect only a small portion of amounts due from our uninsured patients, the increase in the uninsured discount as of January 1, 2014 had no material impact on our 2015 and 2014 net revenues, net income attributable to UHS or net accounts receivable, as compared to 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P33_S4	However, this change resulted in an increase in uninsured discounts and a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts.
352915_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience.
352915_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $399 million and $325 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
352915_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	Uncompensated care (charity care and uninsured discounts):
352915_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:
352915_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	The provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals was approximately $631 million during 2015, $590 million during 2014 and $1.02 billion during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	The decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts during 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to the increase in the uninsured discount (effective January 1, 2014, as discussed above in Charity Care, Uninsured discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts) , and reclassifications among provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending based upon our patients ultimate eligibility determination, as discussed above.
352915_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_16_ITEM15_P38_S1	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P38_S2	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 include amounts due from Illinois of approximately $28 million and $44 million, respectively.
352915_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures.
352915_16_ITEM15_P39_S2	Approximately $12 million as of December 31, 2015 and $23 million as of December 31, 2014, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date.
352915_16_ITEM15_P39_S3	In addition, our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 includes approximately $80 million and $102 million due from Texas in connection with Medicaid supplemental payment programs.
352915_16_ITEM15_P39_S4	The $80 million due from Texas as of December 31, 2015 consists of $47 million related to uncompensated care program revenues, $9 million related to disproportionate share hospital program revenues and $24 million related to Delivery Service Reform Incentive Payment program ( DSRIP ) revenues.
352915_16_ITEM15_P39_S5	The above-mentioned Texas DSRIP receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2015 were collected in January, 2016.
352915_16_ITEM15_P39_S6	Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois and Texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P39_S7	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois and/or Texas.
352915_16_ITEM15_P39_S8	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
352915_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	D) Concentration of Revenues: Our five majority owned acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined basis, 13% in 2015, and 14% in both 2014 and 2013 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_16_ITEM15_P40_S1	E) Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
352915_16_ITEM15_P40_S2	The regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_16_ITEM15_P40_S3	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_16_ITEM15_P40_S4	We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
352915_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	Medicare EHR incentive payments: Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P41_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	Medicaid EHR incentive payments: Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria.
352915_16_ITEM15_P42_S1	Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria.
352915_16_ITEM15_P42_S2	Upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria, our hospitals may become entitled to additional Medicaid EHR incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods.
352915_16_ITEM15_P42_S3	Medicaid EHR incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria were included in other current liabilities (as deferred EHR incentive income) in our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
352915_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	G) Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost.
352915_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	Expenditures for ren ewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts.
352915_16_ITEM15_P44_S2	Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred.
352915_16_ITEM15_P44_S3	We remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from th e accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	Construction-in-progress includes both construction projects and equipment not yet placed into service.
352915_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	We capitalize interest expense on major construction projects while in progress.
352915_16_ITEM15_P45_S2	We capitalized interest on major construction projects and the development and implementation of electronic health records applications amounting to $304,000 during 2015, $0 during 2014 and $4.9 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years).
352915_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	Depreciation expense (excluding discontinued operations) was $337.5 million during 2015, $314.5 million during 2014 and $285.6 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	H) Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_16_ITEM15_P47_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_16_ITEM15_P47_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	I) Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_16_ITEM15_P48_S2	During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we changed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles testing date from September 1st to October 1st.
352915_16_ITEM15_P48_S3	Management believes that this voluntary change in accounting method is preferable as it aligns the annual impairment testing date with our annual budgeting process.
352915_16_ITEM15_P48_S4	In connection with this change, we first performed an impairment test as of September 1, 2015, which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_16_ITEM15_P48_S5	We performed an additional impairment test as of October 1, 2015 which also indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_16_ITEM15_P48_S6	There were also no impairments during 2014 or 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P48_S7	The 2015 change in annual testing date does not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge.
352915_16_ITEM15_P48_S8	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_16_ITEM15_P48_S9	Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2015 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	The decrease in the Behavioral Health Services goodwill consists primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments.
352915_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	J) Other Assets: Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of Foundations Recovery Network, LLC during 2015, Ascend Health Corporation during 2012 and Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. during 2010; (ii) prepaid fees for various software and other applications used by our hospitals; (iii) costs incurred in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities; (iv) required capital reserves related to our commercial insurer; (v) deposits; (vi) investments in various businesses, including Universal Health Realty Income Trust and Premier, Inc.; (vii) the invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related payable included in other noncurrent liabilities; (viii) the estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and; (ix) other miscellaneous assets.
352915_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	As of December 31, 2015, net intangible assets were $219 million and consisted of the following: Tradename ($124 million), Medicare licenses ($57 million), Certificates of need ($12 million), and contract relationships and other ($25 million, net of $25 million of accumulated amortization).
352915_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	($57 million), Certificates of need ($12 million), and contract relationships ($29 million, net of $ 19 million of accumulated amortization).
352915_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	K) Physician Guarantees and Commitments: As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our accrued liabilities-other, and our other assets included $1 million and $2 million, respectively, of estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments.
352915_16_ITEM15_P51_S2	The $1 million of potential future financial obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2015 are potential 2016 obligations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	L) Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_16_ITEM15_P52_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_16_ITEM15_P52_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_16_ITEM15_P52_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_16_ITEM15_P52_S5	See Note 8 for discussion of adjustments to our prior year reserves for claims related to our self-insured general and professional liability and workers compensation liability.
352915_16_ITEM15_P52_S6	In addition, we also: (i) own commercial health insurers headquartered in Nevada and Puerto Rico, and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_16_ITEM15_P52_S7	The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_16_ITEM15_P52_S8	Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	M) Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_16_ITEM15_P54_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_16_ITEM15_P55_S2	See Note 6 Income Taxes, for additional disclosure.
352915_16_ITEM15_P55_S3	Other Noncurrent Liabilities: Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general liability, workers compensation reserves, pension and deferred compensation liabilities, and a liability incurred in connection with split-dollar life insurance agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife.
352915_16_ITEM15_P55_S4	Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest:
352915_16_ITEM15_P55_S5	Outside owners hold noncontrolling, minority ownership interests of: (i) approximately 28% in six acute care facilities (including a facility currently under construction) located in Las Vegas, Nevada; (ii) 20% in an acute care facility located in Washington, D.C.; (iii) approximately 11% in an acute care facility located in Laredo, Texas, and; (iv) 20% in a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
352915_16_ITEM15_P55_S6	The redeemable noncontrolling interest balances of $243 million as of December 31, 2015 and $240 million as of December 31, 2014, and the noncontrolling interest balances of $60 million as of December 31, 2015 and $55 million as of December 31, 2014, consist primarily of the third-party ownership interests in these hospitals.
352915_16_ITEM15_P55_S7	In connection with five acute care facilities (and an additional facility currently under construction) located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have certain put rights that, if exercisable, and if exercised, require us to purchase the minority member s interests at fair market value.
352915_16_ITEM15_P55_S8	The put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of: (i) certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds; (ii) breach of the management contract by the managing member (a subsidiary of ours), or; (iii) if the minority member s ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds.
352915_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	In connection with a behavioral health care facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the PSI acquisition, the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	and the net minimum pension liability of a non-contribu tory defined benefit pension plan which covers employees at one of our subsidiaries.
352915_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	See Note 10, Pension Plan for additional disclosure regarding the defined benefit pension plan.
352915_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	The amounts recognized in AOCI for the two years ended December 31, 2015 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Q) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities and Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts: We manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_16_ITEM15_P60_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_16_ITEM15_P60_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_16_ITEM15_P60_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within stockholders equity.
352915_16_ITEM15_P60_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_16_ITEM15_P61_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_16_ITEM15_P61_S3	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
352915_16_ITEM15_P61_S4	Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.
352915_16_ITEM15_P61_S5	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	We use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates.
352915_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	The effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income and remains there until either the sale or liquidation of the subsidiary.
352915_16_ITEM15_P62_S2	The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
352915_16_ITEM15_P62_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded net favorable cash inflows of $22.9 million and $15.6 million, respectively, associated with these forward exchange contracts.
352915_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	R) Stock-Based Compensation: At December 31, 2015, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans.
352915_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	Pursuant to the FASB s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
352915_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge.
352915_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	The applicable FASB guidance requires that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows.
352915_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
352915_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.
352915_16_ITEM15_P65_S2	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated:
352915_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Net effect of dilutive stock options and grants based on the treasury stock method , for all years presented above, excludes certain outstanding stock options applicable to each year since the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
352915_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	The excluded weighted-average stock options totaled 765,000 during 2015, 2,250 during 2014, and 4,000 during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	T) Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The fair values of our registered debt and investments are based on quoted market prices.
352915_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar maturities and credit quality.
352915_16_ITEM15_P67_S2	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
352915_16_ITEM15_P67_S3	Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	U) Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
352915_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
352915_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	V) Mergers and Acquisitions: The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions.
352915_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
352915_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
352915_16_ITEM15_P70_S2	Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred.
352915_16_ITEM15_P70_S3	The fair value of intangible assets, including Medicare Licenses, Certificates of Need, Tradenames and certain contracts, is based on significant judgments made by our management, and accordingly, for significant items we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.
352915_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	During 2013, we entered into a new group purchasing organization agreement ( GPO ) with Premier, Inc. ( Premier), a healthcare performance improvement alliance, and acquired a minority interest in the GPO for a nominal amount.
352915_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2013, in connection with the completion of an initial public offering of the stock of Premier, we received cash proceeds for the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in the GPO, which were recorded as deferred income and included in liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.
352915_16_ITEM15_P71_S2	The deferred income is being recognized, on a pro rata basis, as a reduction to our supplies expense over the expected life of the GPO agreement.
352915_16_ITEM15_P71_S3	Also in connection with this GPO agreement, w e received shares of restricted stock in Premier which vest ratably over a seven-year period (2014 through 2020), contingent upon our continued participation and minority ownership interest in the GPO.
352915_16_ITEM15_P71_S4	We are recognizing the fair value of this restricted s tock, as a reduction to our supplies expense, in our consolidated statements of income on a pro rata basis over the vesting period.
352915_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	X) Provider Taxes: We incur health-care related taxes ( Provider Taxes ) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services.
352915_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs.
352915_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments.
352915_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	Under these programs, including the impact of Uncompensated Care and Upper Payment Limit programs, and the Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive program, we earned revenues (before Provider Taxes) of approximately $307 million during 2015, $295 million during 2014, and $213 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P73_S2	These revenues were offset by Provider Taxes of approximately $137 million during 2015, $140 million during 2014, and $84 million during 2013, which are recorded in other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income as included herein.
352915_16_ITEM15_P73_S3	Prior to 2015, these Provider Taxes were recorded as a reduction to our net revenues.
352915_16_ITEM15_P73_S4	Accordingly, the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2014 and 2013 have been revised to reflect the current year presentation, resulting in an increase in net revenue and an increase in other operating expenses of $140 million during 2014 and $84 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P73_S5	The aggregate net benefit from these programs was $170 million during 2015, $155 million during 2014, and $130 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P73_S6	The aggregate net benefit pursuant to these programs is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P73_S7	In addition, under various disproportionate share hospital payment programs and the Nevada state plan amendment program, we earned revenues of $46 million in 2015, $59 million in 2014, and $54 million in 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	Y) Recent Accounting Standards: In November, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which eliminates the guidance in Topic 740, Income Taxes, that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet.
352915_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	The amendments require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group, as well as any related valuation allowance, be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet.
352915_16_ITEM15_P74_S2	The amendments are effective for public business entities for annual fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
352915_16_ITEM15_P74_S3	We do not expect the adoption of these amendments to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which changes the reporting requirement for retrospective adjustments to provisional amounts in the measurement period.
352915_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	The amendments in this update require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.
352915_16_ITEM15_P75_S2	The revised guidance is effective for annual fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM15_P75_S3	We do not expect the adoption of this revised guidance to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides guidance for revenue recognition.
352915_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
352915_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	This ASU also requires additional disclosures.
352915_16_ITEM15_P77_S2	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, in July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of this standard, with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
352915_16_ITEM15_P77_S3	We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Preparation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15).
352915_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	Continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity s liquidation becomes imminent.
352915_16_ITEM15_P78_S2	Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting.
352915_16_ITEM15_P78_S3	If and when an entity s liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements Liquidation Basis of Accounting .
352915_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	when an entity s liquidation is not imminent, there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.
352915_16_ITEM15_P79_S1	In those situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the new criteria in ASU 2014-15 should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events.
352915_16_ITEM15_P79_S2	The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are eff ective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
352915_16_ITEM15_P79_S3	We will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU.
352915_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	In April and August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15, Interest- Imputation of Interest, respectively, to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs.
352915_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	The standard requires debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability.
352915_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	The FASB clarified that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements can be presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the arrangement.
352915_16_ITEM15_P81_S2	The guidance is effective for annual fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM15_P81_S3	We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	Z) Foreign Currency Translation: Assets and liabilities of our U.K. subsidiaries are denominated in pound sterling and translated into U.S. dollars at: (i) the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and; (ii) average rates of exchange prevailing during the year for revenues and expenses.
352915_16_ITEM15_P82_S1	The currency translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
352915_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	Year ended December 31, 2015: 2015 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2015 we spent $534 million to:
352915_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	various other businesses, a management contract and real property assets.
352915_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their preliminary estimated fair values as follows:
352915_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price.
352915_16_ITEM15_P86_S1	The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities: (i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.
352915_16_ITEM15_P86_S2	The vast majority of the goodwill resulting from these transactions is not deductible for federal income tax purposes (see Note 6.
352915_16_ITEM15_P86_S3	Other assets includes an indefinite lived tradename for $124 million recorded in connection with the Foundations acquisition.
352915_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the dates of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, was not material to our 2015 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_16_ITEM15_P87_S1	Assuming the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2015, our 2015 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $9.17 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $690 million, or $6.85 per diluted share.
352915_16_ITEM15_P87_S2	Assuming the above-mentioned acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2014, our 2014 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $8.35 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $545 million and $5.42 per diluted share.
352915_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	2015 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: During 2015 we received $3 million in connection with the divestiture of a small operator of behavioral health care services.
352915_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	Year ended December 31, 2014: 2014 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2014 we spent $431 million to:
352915_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their preliminary estimated fair values as follows:
352915_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	Goodwill of the facilities acquired is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price.
352915_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities: (i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.
352915_16_ITEM15_P90_S2	The vast majority of the goodwill resulting from these transactions is not deductible for federal income tax purposes (see Note 6.
352915_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	Included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 was an aggregate of approximately $175 million representing the net revenues generated at the Cygnet facilities, the commercial health insurer located in Reno, Nevada and the 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center located in Washington, D.C., from their respective dates of acquisition through December 31, 2014.
352915_16_ITEM15_P91_S1	The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the dates of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, was not material to our 2014 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_16_ITEM15_P91_S2	Assuming the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2014, our 2014 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $8.28 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $558 million, or $5.55 per diluted share.
352915_16_ITEM15_P91_S3	Assuming the above-mentioned acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2013, our 2013 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $7.62 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $522 million and $5.25 per diluted share.
352915_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	2014 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: During 2014 we received $15 million in connection with the divestiture of a non-operating investment (during the first quarter) and the real property of a closed behavioral health facility (during the second quarter).
352915_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	Year ended December 31, 2013: 2013 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2013, we spent an aggregate of $13 million for the purchase of real property located in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.
352915_16_ITEM15_P93_S1	The aggregate net purchase price of these properties was allocated to property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: During 2013, we received an aggregate of $37 million in connection with the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services (sold during the second quarter of 2013) and certain other assets and real property including three previously closed behavioral health care facilities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P94_S1	As discussed below in Discontinued Operations , we agreed to sell Peak Behavioral Health Services as part of our agreement with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation ( Ascend ) in October of 2012.
352915_16_ITEM15_P94_S2	The aggregate pre-tax gain on these divestitures was approximately $3 million and in included in our 2013 consolidated results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P94_S3	Discontinued Operations There were no material divestitures during 2015 or 2014.
352915_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	In connection with the receipt of antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in connection with our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October of 2012, we agreed to certain conditions, including the divestiture of Peak Behavioral Health Services ( Peak ), a 104-bed behavioral health care facility located in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
352915_16_ITEM15_P95_S1	The divestiture of Peak was completed during the second quarter of 2013 for total cash proceeds of approximately $24 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million which is included in our 2013 consolidated financial statements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P95_S2	The following table shows the results of operations for Peak, which was reflected as discontinued operations during our period of ownership during 2013 (amounts in thousands).
352915_16_ITEM15_P95_S3	Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense is not material to our consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to other operating expenses.
352915_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges: During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had no fair value hedges outstanding.
352915_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	Cash Flow Hedges: We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_16_ITEM15_P97_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_16_ITEM15_P98_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_16_ITEM15_P98_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_16_ITEM15_P98_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_16_ITEM15_P99_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_16_ITEM15_P99_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_16_ITEM15_P99_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_16_ITEM15_P101_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2015 and 2014 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_16_ITEM15_P101_S2	We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_16_ITEM15_P102_S1	We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties.
352915_16_ITEM15_P102_S2	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

352915_16_ITEM15_P140_S3	As of December 31, 2015, approximately 1.5 million shares of Class B Common Stock remain available for issuance pursuant to these various plans.
352915_16_ITEM15_P140_S4	At December 31, 2015, 24,056,061 shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans.
352915_16_ITEM15_P140_S5	Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.
352915_16_ITEM15_P141_S0	6) INCOME TAXES Components of income tax expense/(benefit) are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM15_P142_S0	Deferred taxes are required to be classified based on the financial statement classification of the related assets and liabilities which give rise to temporary differences.
352915_16_ITEM15_P143_S0	Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement ca rrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P143_S1	The components of deferred taxes are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM15_P144_S0	Increases in deferred tax assets relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards reflect the impact of deferred taxes recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of 5 additional behavioral health care facilities located in the U.K. during 2015.
352915_16_ITEM15_P145_S0	Increases in deferred tax liabilities relating to depreciable and separately identifiable intangible assets primarily reflect the impact of deferred taxes recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network, LLC ( Foundations ).
352915_16_ITEM15_P146_S0	The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM15_P147_S0	Impacting the effective tax rates during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were favorable discrete tax items of approximately $1 million recorded during each year to adjust the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions.
352915_16_ITEM15_P148_S0	The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $41 million in 2015, $15 million in 2014 and $6 million in 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P148_S1	Our consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on undistributed earnings that we do not intend to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.
352915_16_ITEM15_P148_S2	Certain of our undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. have a statutory rate of 20.25%.
352915_16_ITEM15_P148_S3	As of December 31, 2015, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $53 million of such earnings.
352915_16_ITEM15_P148_S4	The amount of unrecognizable deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be approximately $8 million.
352915_16_ITEM15_P149_S0	A reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows:
352915_16_ITEM15_P150_S0	Included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are prepaid federal, foreign, and state income taxes amounting to approximately $42 million and $17 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
352915_16_ITEM15_P150_S1	The net deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM15_P151_S0	The assets and liabilities classified as current relate primarily to the allowance for uncollectible patient accounts, compensation-related accruals and the current portion of the temporary differences related to self- insurance reserves.
352915_16_ITEM15_P152_S0	At December 31, 2015, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2016 through 2035), and credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $1.08 billion representing approximately $53 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit).
352915_16_ITEM15_P152_S1	At December 31, 2015, there were foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $20 million expiring through 2023 representing approximately $5 million in deferred foreign tax benefit.
352915_16_ITEM15_P153_S0	A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
352915_16_ITEM15_P153_S1	Based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized.
352915_16_ITEM15_P153_S2	Therefore, valuation allowances of approximately $51 million and $50 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
352915_16_ITEM15_P153_S3	During 2015, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by $1 million due to additional net operating losses incurred.
352915_16_ITEM15_P153_S4	In addition, valuation allowances of approximately $2 million and $3 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 related to foreign net operating losses.
352915_16_ITEM15_P153_S5	There were no significant increases in valuation allowances as a result of the acquisition of Foundations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P154_S0	We adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007.
352915_16_ITEM15_P154_S1	During 2015 and 2014, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased less than $1 million due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years.
352915_16_ITEM15_P154_S2	During 2015, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately $1 million.
352915_16_ITEM15_P154_S3	The balance at each of December 31, 2015 and 2014, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively.
352915_16_ITEM15_P154_S4	We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.
352915_16_ITEM15_P154_S5	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we have accrued interest and penalties of less than $1 million as of each date.
352915_16_ITEM15_P154_S6	The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2012 and subsequent years.
352915_16_ITEM15_P155_S0	Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years.
352915_16_ITEM15_P155_S1	The statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months.
352915_16_ITEM15_P155_S2	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months, however, it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P155_S3	The tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is as follows (amounts in thousands).
352915_16_ITEM15_P156_S0	7) LEASE COMMITMENTS Three of our hospital facilities are held under operating leases with Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms expiring in 2016 (see Note 9 for additional disclosure).
352915_16_ITEM15_P156_S1	We also lease the real property of certain facilities (see Item 2.
352915_16_ITEM15_P156_S2	A summary of property under capital lease follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM15_P157_S0	Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as of December 31, 2015, are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM15_P158_S0	During 2015 and 2014, we assumed capital lease obligations of approximately $7 million and $16 million, respectively, in connection with the leases on certain real estate assets.
352915_16_ITEM15_P158_S1	We incurred no capital lease obligations during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P158_S2	In the ordinary course of business, our facilities routinely lease equipment pursuant to new lease arrangements that will likely result in future lease and rental expense in excess of amounts indicated above.
352915_16_ITEM15_P159_S0	8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Professional and General Liability, Workers Compensation Liability and Property Insurance Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability: Effective November, 2010, excluding certain subsidiaries acquired since 2010 as discussed below, the vast majority of our subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million and $3 million per occurrence, respectively.
352915_16_ITEM15_P159_S1	Our subsidiaries were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred in 2015 and 2014 and up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred from 2011 through 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P159_S2	We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_16_ITEM15_P159_S3	Since our acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ) in November, 2010, the former PSI subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $3 million per occurrence.
352915_16_ITEM15_P159_S4	The nine behavioral health facilities acquired from Ascend Health Corporation ( Ascend ) in October, 2012 have general and professional liability policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to $12 million of aggregate coverage, subject to a $100,000 per occurrence deductible.
352915_16_ITEM15_P159_S5	The 21 behavioral health care facilities located in the U.K. have policies through a commercial insurance carrier located in the U. K. that provides for 10 million of professional liability coverage and 25 million of general liability coverage.
352915_16_ITEM15_P159_S6	The facilities acquired from PSI, Ascend and the facilities located in the U.K., like our other facilities, are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations, as mentioned above.
352915_16_ITEM15_P160_S0	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for t hese claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_16_ITEM15_P160_S1	While we continuously monitor these f actors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_16_ITEM15_P160_S2	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P160_S3	As of December 31, 2015, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $204 million, of which $48 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P160_S4	As of December 31, 2014, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $193 million, of which $51 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P160_S5	Below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and workers compensation reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2015 (amount in thousands):
352915_16_ITEM15_P161_S0	General and professional liability amounts are net of adjustments recorded during 2014 and 2013, as discussed below.
352915_16_ITEM15_P162_S0	The adjustments recorded during 2015 to our prior year reserves for professional and general liability claims did not have a material impact on our 2015 consolidated results of operations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P162_S1	We recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $20 million during 2014, and $81 million during 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P162_S2	The favorable change recorded during 2014 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis.
352915_16_ITEM15_P162_S3	The favorable change in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2013, relating to years prior to 2013, were due primarily to: (i) an increased weighting given to company-specific metrics (to 100% from 75%), and decreased general industry metrics (to 0% from 25%), related to projected incidents per exposure, historical claims experience and loss development factors; (ii) historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate, and; (iii) a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties (such as obstetrical) due to a continuation of the company-wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years.
352915_16_ITEM15_P162_S4	As the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased, thereby providing for a statistically significant data group, and taking into consideration our long-history of company-specific risk management programs and claims experience, our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends.
352915_16_ITEM15_P163_S0	As of December 31, 2015, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $68 million, of which $34 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P163_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $67 million, of which $32 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P163_S2	The adjustments recorded during the last three years to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P163_S3	Although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for self-insured general and professional and workers compensation claims, given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves, as discussed above, it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves.
352915_16_ITEM15_P164_S0	We have commercial property insurance policies for our properties covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a deductible ranging from $50,000 to $250,000 per occurrence.
352915_16_ITEM15_P164_S1	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_16_ITEM15_P164_S2	In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_16_ITEM15_P164_S3	Our earthquake limit is $250 million, subject to a deductible of $250,000, except for facilities located within documented fault zones.
352915_16_ITEM15_P164_S4	Earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the United States are subject to a $100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1% to 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_16_ITEM15_P164_S5	The earthquake limit in Puerto Rico is $25 million, subject to a $25,000 deductible.
352915_16_ITEM15_P164_S6	Non-critical flood losses have either a $250,000 or $500,000 deductible, based upon the location of the facility.
352915_16_ITEM15_P164_S7	Since certain of our facilities have been designated by our insurer as flood prone, we have elected to purchase policies from The National Flood Insurance Program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible.
352915_16_ITEM15_P164_S8	Property insurance for the facilities acquired from Cygnet are provided on an all risk basis up to a 180 million limit that includes coverage for real and personal property as well as business interruption losses.
352915_16_ITEM15_P164_S9	Legal Proceedings We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations, regulatory matters and litigation, as outlined below.
352915_16_ITEM15_P165_S0	Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) and Government Investigations: In February, 2013, the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and certain UHS owned behavioral health facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_16_ITEM15_P165_S1	The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_16_ITEM15_P165_S2	Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P165_S3	We were advised that a qui tam action had been filed against Roxbury Treatment Center but the government declined to intervene and the case was dismissed.
352915_16_ITEM15_P166_S0	In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various documents from January, 2005 to the date of the subpoenas.
352915_16_ITEM15_P166_S1	In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records.
352915_16_ITEM15_P166_S2	In October, 2013, we were advised by the DOJ s Criminal Frauds Section that they received a referral from the DOJ Civil Division and opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center.
352915_16_ITEM15_P166_S3	Subsequent subpoenas have since been issued to River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center requesting additional documentation.
352915_16_ITEM15_P167_S0	In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal regulations regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P167_S1	The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility.
352915_16_ITEM15_P167_S2	River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension.
352915_16_ITEM15_P167_S3	Notwithstanding, CMS continued the payment suspension.
352915_16_ITEM15_P167_S4	River Point Behavioral Health provided additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect.
352915_16_ITEM15_P167_S5	In August, 2015, we received notification from CMS that, effective September, 2015, the payment suspension will be continued for another 180 days.
352915_16_ITEM15_P167_S6	We cannot predict if and/or when the facility s suspended payments will resume.
352915_16_ITEM15_P167_S7	Although the operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014, the payment suspension has had a material adverse effect on the facility s results of operations and financial condition.
352915_16_ITEM15_P168_S0	In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_16_ITEM15_P169_S0	In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy.
352915_16_ITEM15_P170_S0	In March, 2014, a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) was served on the National Deaf Academy requesting documents and information from the facility from January 1, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_16_ITEM15_P170_S1	We have been advised by the government that the National Deaf Academy has been added to the facilities which are the subject of the coordinated investigation referenced above.
352915_16_ITEM15_P171_S0	In March, 2014, CIDs were served on Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Streamwood Behavioral Health requesting documents and information from those facilities from January, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_16_ITEM15_P171_S1	In September, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division advised us that they were expanding their investigation to include four additional facilities and were requesting production of documents from these facilities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P171_S2	These facilities are Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons by the Sea, and Turning Point Care Center.
352915_16_ITEM15_P172_S0	In December, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division requested that Salt Lake Behavioral Health produce documents responsive to the original subpoenas issued in February, 2013.
352915_16_ITEM15_P172_S1	In March, 2015, the OIG issued subpoenas to Central Florida Behavioral Hospital and University Behavioral Center requesting certain documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_16_ITEM15_P172_S2	In late March, 2015, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include UHS as a corporate entity arising out of the coordinated investigation of the facilities described above and, in particular, Hartgrove Hospital.
352915_16_ITEM15_P172_S3	In December, 2015, we were notified by the DOJ Civil Division that the civil investigation also includes Arbour Hospital, Arbour-Fuller Hospital, Pembroke Hospital and Westwood Lodge located in Massachusetts.
352915_16_ITEM15_P172_S4	To date, these facilities have not received any requests for documentation or other information.
352915_16_ITEM15_P172_S5	The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation referenced above is a False Claim Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P172_S6	At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure of the Company and/or named facilities, if any, in connection with these matters.
352915_16_ITEM15_P173_S0	In December, 2015, we were advised that the DOJ opened an investigation involving the El Paso Behavioral Health System in El Paso, Texas.
352915_16_ITEM15_P173_S1	The DOJ is investigating potential Stark law violations relating to arrangements between the facility and physician(s) at the facility.
352915_16_ITEM15_P173_S2	These agreements were entered into before we acquired the facility as a part of our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.
352915_16_ITEM15_P173_S3	To our knowledge, this matter is not a part of the omnibus investigation referenced above.
352915_16_ITEM15_P173_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_16_ITEM15_P174_S0	In January, 2016, we were notified that the Department of Justice opened an investigation of the South Texas Health System of a potential False Claim Act case regarding compensation paid to cardiologists pursuant to employment agreements entered into in 2005.
352915_16_ITEM15_P174_S1	At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_16_ITEM15_P175_S0	Regulatory Matters: On July 23, 2015, Timberlawn Mental Health System ( Timberlawn ) received notification from CMS of its intent to terminate Timberlawn s Medicare provider agreement effective August 7, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM15_P175_S1	This notification resulted from surveys conducted which alleged that Timberlawn was out of compliance with conditions of participation required for participation in the Medicare/Medicaid program.
352915_16_ITEM15_P175_S2	We filed a request for expedited administrative appeal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Departmental Appeals Board, Civil Remedies Division, seeking review and reversal of the termination action.
352915_16_ITEM15_P175_S3	In conjunction with the administrative appeal, we filed litigation in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of Texas seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to have the termination stayed pending the conclusion of the administrative appeal.
352915_16_ITEM15_P175_S4	The trial court denied Timberlawn s request for a temporary restraining order and dismissed the case.
352915_16_ITEM15_P175_S5	Timberlawn s provider agreement was terminated effective August 14, 2015.
352915_16_ITEM15_P175_S6	In September, 2015 Timberlawn reached an agreement with CMS relative to its reapplication to the Medicare/Medicaid program.
352915_16_ITEM15_P175_S7	In exchange, Timberlawn agreed to dismiss its administrative appeal as well as not to pursue an appeal of the decision of the trial court.
352915_16_ITEM15_P175_S8	During this time, Timberlawn has remained open.
352915_16_ITEM15_P176_S0	In December, 2015, Timberlawn received notice from the Texas Department of State Health Services of its intent to revoke Timberlawn s license and impose an administrative penalty.
352915_16_ITEM15_P176_S1	We have appealed and are contesting the proposed revocation and fine.
352915_16_ITEM15_P177_S0	In January, 2016, Timberlawn submitted its application for re-enrollment into the Medicare/Medicaid program.
352915_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	Although the operating results of Timberlawn did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014, the termination of Timberlawn s provider agreement has had a material adverse effect on the facility s results of operations and financial condition.
352915_16_ITEM15_P179_S0	During the second quarter of 2015, Texoma Medical Center ( Texoma ), which includes TMC Behavioral Health Center, entered into a Systems Improvement Agreement ( SIA ) with CMS.
352915_16_ITEM15_P179_S1	The SIA abated a termination action from CMS following surveys which identified alleged failures to comply with conditions of participation primarily involving Texoma s behavioral health operations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P180_S0	develop implementation plans at Texoma to meet Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_16_ITEM15_P180_S1	At the conclusion of the SIA, CMS will conduct a full certification survey to determine if Texoma is in substantial compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation.
352915_16_ITEM15_P180_S2	The term of agreement is set to conclude October 2, 2016 unless the terms of the agreement are fulf illed earlier.
352915_16_ITEM15_P181_S0	During the term of the SIA, Texoma remains eligible to receive reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid for services rendered to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
352915_16_ITEM15_P182_S0	In late September, 2015, many hospitals in Pennsylvania, including seven of our behavioral health care hospitals located in the state, received letters from the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare ( DPW ) demanding repayment of allegedly excess Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments ( DSH ) for the federal fiscal year 2011 ( FFY2011 ) amounting to approximately $4 million in the aggregate.
352915_16_ITEM15_P182_S1	We have filed administrative appeals for all of our facilities contesting the recoupment efforts since we believe DPW s calculation methodology is inaccurate and conflicts with applicable federal and state laws and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P182_S2	DPW has agreed to postpone the recoupment of the state s share of the DSH payments until all hospital appeals are resolved.
352915_16_ITEM15_P182_S3	DPW also extended the deadline to recoup the federal share (2011 federal share is 55%) until April 30, 2016.
352915_16_ITEM15_P182_S4	However, if DPW is ultimately successful in its demand related to FFY2011, it could take similar action with regards to FFY2012 through FFY2014.
352915_16_ITEM15_P183_S0	Due to a change in the Pennsylvania Medicaid State Plan and implementation of a CMS-approved Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver, we do not believe the methodology applied by DPW to FFY2011 is applicable to reimbursements received for Medicaid services provided after January 1, 2015 by our behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania.
352915_16_ITEM15_P183_S1	We can provide no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our legal and administrative appeals related to DPW s repayment demands.
352915_16_ITEM15_P183_S2	If our legal and administrative appeals are unsuccessful, our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by these repayments.

352915_16_ITEM15_P187_S5	We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry which subjects us to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P187_S6	These claims or suits include claims for damages for personal injuries, medical malpractice, commercial/contractual disputes, wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians staff privileges, and employment related claims, In addition, health care companies are subject to investigations and/or actions by various state and federal governmental agencies or those bringing claims on their behalf.
352915_16_ITEM15_P187_S7	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations against healthcare providers concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes as well as compliance with clinical and operational regulations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P187_S8	Currently, and from time to time, we and some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries in the form of subpoenas, Civil Investigative Demands, audits and other document requests from various federal and state agencies.
352915_16_ITEM15_P187_S9	These inquiries can lead to notices and/or actions including repayment obligations from state and federal government agencies associated with potential non-compliance with laws and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P187_S10	Further, the federal False Claim Act allows private individuals to bring lawsuits (qui tam actions) against healthcare providers that submit claims for payments to the government.
352915_16_ITEM15_P188_S0	Various states have also adopted similar statutes.
352915_16_ITEM15_P188_S1	When such a claim is filed, the government will investigate the matter and decide if they are going to intervene in the pending case.
352915_16_ITEM15_P188_S2	These qui tam lawsuits are placed under seal by the court to comply with the False Claims Act s requirements.
352915_16_ITEM15_P188_S3	If the government chooses not to intervene, the private individual(s) can proceed independently on behalf of the government.
352915_16_ITEM15_P189_S0	Health care providers that are found to violate the False Claims Act may be subject to substantial monetary fines/penalties as well as face potential exclusion from participating in government health care programs or be required to comply with Corporate Integrity Agreements as a condition of a settlement of a False Claim Act matter.

352915_16_ITEM15_P191_S2	In the event a facility is found to be out of compliance with a Condition of Participation and unable to remedy the alleged deficiency(s), the facility faces termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or compliance with a System Improvement Agreement to remedy deficiencies and ensure compliance.
352915_16_ITEM15_P192_S0	The laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry are complex covering, among other things, government healthcare participation requirements, licensure, certification and accreditation, privacy of patient information, reimbursement for patient services as well as fraud and abuse compliance.
352915_16_ITEM15_P192_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and expanding.
352915_16_ITEM15_P192_S2	Further, the Affordable Care Act has added additional obligations on healthcare providers to report and refund overpayments by government healthcare programs and authorizes the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.
352915_16_ITEM15_P192_S3	We monitor our business and have developed an ethics and compliance program with respect to these complex laws, rules and regulations.
352915_16_ITEM15_P192_S4	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with government regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with the sanctions referenced above which include fines, penalties and/or substantial damages, repayment obligations, payment suspensions, licensure revocation, and expulsion from government healthcare programs.
352915_16_ITEM15_P192_S5	Even if we were to ultimately prevail in any action brought against us or our facilities or in responding to any inquiry, such action or inquiry could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_16_ITEM15_P192_S6	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_16_ITEM15_P192_S7	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_16_ITEM15_P192_S8	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.

352915_17_ITEM1_P10_S10	In accordance with Section 303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, we submitted our CEO s certification to the New York Stock Exchange in 2016.
352915_17_ITEM1_P10_S11	Additionally, contained in Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are our CEO s and CFO s certifications regarding the quality of our public disclosures under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
352915_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our Mission Our mission and objective is to provide superior quality healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends, physicians prefer for their patients, purchasers select for their clients, employees are proud of, and investors seek for long-term returns.
352915_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	To achieve this, we have a commitment to:
352915_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe community-based hospitals will remain the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of self-determination for both the company and our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	We selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	We are committed to a program of rational growth around our core businesses, while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve.
352915_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P12_S4	We also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy.
352915_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Improvement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.
352915_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	We also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.
352915_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	From time to time applications are filed with state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need, or CONs.
352915_17_ITEM1_P13_S4	Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.
352915_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible.
352915_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	We are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees, communities and our stockholders.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	We believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S4	Generally, we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S5	Other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S6	Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S7	Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S8	We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S9	In addition, hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S10	The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated.
352915_17_ITEM1_P15_S11	Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture.
352915_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Average Available Beds is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available for patient care.
352915_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	A hospital may have appropriate licenses for more beds than are in service for a number of reasons, including lack of demand, incomplete construction, and anticipation of future needs.
352915_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Patient Days is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.
352915_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Occupancy Rate is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of average beds, either available or licensed.
352915_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Sources of Revenue We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Sources of Revenue for additional disclosure.
352915_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Reporting.
352915_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self-referrals by physicians).
352915_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected.
352915_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.
352915_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Licensing, Certification and Accreditation: All of our U.S. hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations in the U.S. and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness.
352915_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments.
352915_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.
352915_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our facilities in the United Kingdom are also subject to various laws and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	All of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by The Joint Commission.
352915_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers in the U.S. are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P22_S3	If any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors.
352915_17_ITEM1_P22_S4	We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards.
352915_17_ITEM1_P22_S5	The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Certificates of Need: Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need ( CON ) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility s license, which could harm our business.
352915_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_17_ITEM1_P25_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions.
352915_17_ITEM1_P25_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_17_ITEM1_P25_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Utilization Review: Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services.
352915_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Organizations ( PROs ) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group ( DRG ) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay.
352915_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program.
352915_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.
352915_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Audits: Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims.
352915_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights.
352915_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	The federal government contracts with third-party recovery audit contractors ( RACs ) and Medicaid integrity contractors ( MICs ), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers.
352915_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	The Recovery Audit Prepayment Review demonstration program will enable RACs to review claims before they are paid to ensure that the provider complied with all Medicare payment rules.
352915_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	Currently, the demonstration program is targeting states with high populations of fraud- and error-prone providers.
352915_17_ITEM1_P30_S3	Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors ( ZPICs ) target claims for potential fraud and abuse.
352915_17_ITEM1_P30_S4	Additionally, Medicare administrative contractors ( MACs ) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers.
352915_17_ITEM1_P30_S5	The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) announced its intent to consolidate many of these Medicare and Medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors ( UPICs ), though it remains unclear what effect, if any, this proposed consolidation may have.
352915_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years, the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial.
352915_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
352915_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation The Stark Law:
352915_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met.
352915_17_ITEM1_P33_S2	These types of referrals are known as self-referrals.
352915_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to $15,000 for each violation, up to $100,000 for sham arrangements, up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs.
352915_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart.
352915_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	This regulation also places a number of compliance requirements on physician-owned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest.
352915_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.
352915_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.
352915_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Anti-kickback Statute: A provision of the Social Security Act known as the anti-kickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program.
352915_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	However, changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti-kickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law.
352915_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	The anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors, from the federal anti-kickback statute for various activities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services.
352915_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws.
352915_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Similar State Laws: Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care.
352915_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure.
352915_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes.
352915_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
352915_17_ITEM1_P42_S4	These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_17_ITEM1_P42_S5	It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_17_ITEM1_P42_S6	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see Item 3.
352915_17_ITEM1_P42_S7	Legal Proceedings), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_17_ITEM1_P42_S8	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_17_ITEM1_P42_S9	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs.
352915_17_ITEM1_P42_S10	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations: A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the False Claims Act s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions.
352915_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.
352915_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	When a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781 to $21,563 for each separate false claim.
352915_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act.
352915_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government.
352915_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 ( FERA ) has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds.
352915_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	FERA also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments.
352915_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act.
352915_17_ITEM1_P47_S4	Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court.
352915_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Recent changes to the False Claims Act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified, or by the date any corresponding cost report was due, whichever is later.
352915_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	Failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil False Claims Act liability.
352915_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions: The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud.
352915_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.
352915_17_ITEM1_P48_S5	Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs.
352915_17_ITEM1_P48_S6	HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare.
352915_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.
352915_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:
352915_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically.
352915_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry.
352915_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information.
352915_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed.
352915_17_ITEM1_P50_S4	Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.
352915_17_ITEM1_P50_S5	We believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of HIPAA, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance.
352915_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information.
352915_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements.
352915_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	HITECH has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred.
352915_17_ITEM1_P51_S3	We believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date.
352915_17_ITEM1_P51_S4	Recent changes to the HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers, including expanded obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.
352915_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft.
352915_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010, signed on December 18, 2010, appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the Red Flags Rule, but permits the FTC or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the Red Flags Rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft.
352915_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	Compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future.
352915_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005: On July 29, 2005, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 was enacted, which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety.
352915_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	This legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report Patient Safety Work Product ( PSWP ) to Patient Safety Organizations ( PSOs ).
352915_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	Under the system, PSWP is made privileged, confidential and legally protected from disclosure.
352915_17_ITEM1_P53_S3	PSWP does not include medical, discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety.
352915_17_ITEM1_P53_S4	This legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute PSWP.
352915_17_ITEM1_P53_S5	PSOs are certified by the Secretary of the HHS for three-year periods and analyze PSWP, provide feedback to providers and may report non-identifiable PSWP to a database.
352915_17_ITEM1_P53_S6	In addition, PSOs are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies.
352915_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs.
352915_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P54_S3	We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.
352915_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine: Several states, including Florida, Nevada, California and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services.
352915_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties.
352915_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable.
352915_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	These statutes and/or regulations vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.
352915_17_ITEM1_P55_S4	We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians.
352915_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.
352915_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	EMTALA: All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act ( EMTALA ).
352915_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	This federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition.
352915_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment.
352915_17_ITEM1_P57_S3	There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay.
352915_17_ITEM1_P57_S4	Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program.
352915_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.
352915_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions.
352915_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	CMS has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments.
352915_17_ITEM1_P59_S3	The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future.
352915_17_ITEM1_P59_S4	We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.
352915_17_ITEM1_P59_S5	Health Care Industry Investigations: We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation.
352915_17_ITEM1_P59_S6	Legal Proceedings included herein for additional disclosure.
352915_17_ITEM1_P59_S7	In addition, currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_17_ITEM1_P59_S8	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_17_ITEM1_P60_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P60_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.
352915_17_ITEM1_P60_S4	Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P60_S5	It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity.
352915_17_ITEM1_P60_S6	It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.
352915_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them.
352915_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.
352915_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	State Rate Review: Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state.
352915_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform: Medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level.
352915_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	All states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits.
352915_17_ITEM1_P63_S2	Over half of the states have limits on damages awards.
352915_17_ITEM1_P63_S3	Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits, and many states have established limits on attorney fees.
352915_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	Many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform.
352915_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform, and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates.
352915_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	Reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.
352915_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	Compliance Program: Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998.
352915_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	Currently, the program s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program s policies.
352915_17_ITEM1_P65_S2	Since its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry s expectations and our needs.
352915_17_ITEM1_P65_S3	Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business.
352915_17_ITEM1_P65_S4	Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program.
352915_17_ITEM1_P65_S5	Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas.
352915_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.
352915_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	United Kingdom Regulation: Our operations in the United Kingdom are also subject to a high level of regulation relating to registration and licensing requirements, employee regulation, clinical standards, environmental rules as well as other areas.
352915_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	We are also subject to a highly regulated business environment, and failure to comply with the various laws and regulations applicable to us could lead to substantial penalties and other adverse effects on our business.
352915_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our facilities located in the U.S. had approximately 75,325 employees as of December 31, 2016, of whom approximately 54,800 were employed full-time.
352915_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	In addition, our facilities located in the U.K. had approximately 5,800 employees as of December 31, 2016.
352915_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	In a number of our markets, physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours.
352915_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	Within our acute care division, approximately 190 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P69_S3	Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time.
352915_17_ITEM1_P69_S4	In addition, within our behavioral health division, approximately 440 psychiatrists are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P69_S5	Each of our hospitals is managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of ours.
352915_17_ITEM1_P69_S6	In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital.
352915_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
352915_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	Approximately 1,000 of our employees at six of our hospitals are unionized.
352915_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	At Valley Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union and the International Union of Operating Engineers.
352915_17_ITEM1_P71_S2	Nurses, technicians and engineers at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) and the International Union of Operating Engineers.
352915_17_ITEM1_P71_S3	At The George Washington University Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the SEIU or the Hospital Police Association.
352915_17_ITEM1_P71_S4	At the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, clinical, clerical, support and maintenance employees are represented by the Communication Workers of America (AFL-CIO).
352915_17_ITEM1_P71_S5	Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain technicians and therapists, pharmacy assistants, and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU.
352915_17_ITEM1_P71_S6	At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Teamsters and the Northwestern Nurses Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals.
352915_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	The health care industry is highly competitive.
352915_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment.
352915_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes.
352915_17_ITEM1_P73_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_17_ITEM1_P73_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us.
352915_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.
352915_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in determining a hospital s success and competitive advantage.
352915_17_ITEM1_P75_S1	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_17_ITEM1_P75_S2	We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient s needs, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital s facilities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P75_S3	We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.
352915_17_ITEM1_P75_S4	In addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals.
352915_17_ITEM1_P75_S5	We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate.
352915_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_17_ITEM1_P76_S2	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	Many states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws.
352915_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states.
352915_17_ITEM1_P77_S2	In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.
352915_17_ITEM1_P77_S3	Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges.
352915_17_ITEM1_P78_S2	In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients.
352915_17_ITEM1_P78_S3	Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience.
352915_17_ITEM1_P78_S4	The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	A key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S1	The competition to acquire hospitals is significant.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S2	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S3	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S4	We intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S5	Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust At December 31, 2016, we held approximately 5.8% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the Trust ).
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S6	We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement, which is scheduled to expire on December 31 st of each year, pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S7	In December, 2016, the advisory agreement was renewed by the Trust for 2017 pursuant to the same terms in place during each of the last three years.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S8	During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the advisory fee was computed at 0.70% of the Trust s average invested real estate assets.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S9	In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S10	Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S11	We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $3.3 million during 2016, $2.8 million during 2015 and $2.5 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S12	Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.0 million during 2016, $1.4 million during 2015 and $3.2 million during 2014, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S13	Included in our share of the Trust s income was approximately $500,000 in 2015, and $2.3 million in 2014, related to our share of gains on various transactions recorded by the Trust.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S14	The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $7.7 million and $8.7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S15	The market value of our investment in the Trust was $51.7 million at December 31, 2016 and $39.4 million at December 31, 2015, based on the closing price of the Trust s stock on the respective dates.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S16	Total rent expense under the operating leases on the three hospital facilities with the Trust during 2016 and 2015 was $15.9 million and $15.6 million, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S17	Total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the Trust during 2014 (as discussed below) was $16.8 million.
352915_17_ITEM1_P79_S18	In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings and two free-standing emergency departments ( FEDs ) owned by the Trust or by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds 95% to 100% of the ownership interest.
352915_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries.
352915_17_ITEM1_P80_S1	Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms.
352915_17_ITEM1_P80_S2	Each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below.
352915_17_ITEM1_P80_S3	The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year.
352915_17_ITEM1_P80_S4	The leases with those subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.
352915_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	In June, 2016, we provided the required notice to the Trust, exercising the 5-year renewal options on McAllen Medical Center, Wellington Regional Medical Center and Southwest Healthcare System, Inland Valley Campus.
352915_17_ITEM1_P81_S1	The renewals extend the lease terms on these facilities, at existing lease rates, through December, 2021.
352915_17_ITEM1_P81_S2	During the first quarter of 2015, wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours sold to and leased back from the Trust, two newly constructed FEDs located in Texas which were completed and opened during the first quarter of 2015.
352915_17_ITEM1_P81_S3	In conjunction with these transactions, ten-year lease agreements with six, five-year renewal options have been executed with the Trust.
352915_17_ITEM1_P81_S4	We have the option to purchase the properties upon the expiration of the fixed terms and each five-year renewal terms at the fair market value of the property.
352915_17_ITEM1_P81_S5	The aggregate construction cost/sales proceeds of these facilities was approximately $13 million, and the aggregate rent expense paid to the Trust at the commencement of the leases was approximately $900,000 annually.
352915_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	In December, 2014, upon the expiration of the lease term, we elected to purchase from the Trust for $17.3 million, the real property of The Bridgeway, a 103-bed behavioral health care facility located in North Little Rock, Arkansas.
352915_17_ITEM1_P82_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the lease, we and the Trust were both required to obtain appraisals of the property to determine its fair market value/purchase price.
352915_17_ITEM1_P82_S2	The rent expense paid by us to the Trust, prior to our purchase of The Bridgeway s real property in December, 2014, was approximately $1.1 million annually.
352915_17_ITEM1_P82_S3	The table below details the renewal options and terms for each of our three hospital facilities leased from the Trust:
352915_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	We have two 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).
352915_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the three hospital leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term.
352915_17_ITEM1_P84_S1	We also have the right to purchase the respective leased hospitals at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at their appraised fair market value as well as purchase any or all of the three leased hospital properties at the appraised fair market value upon one month s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur.
352915_17_ITEM1_P84_S2	In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.

352915_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also impact our business and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	A significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in Texas, Nevada and California.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We own 7 inpatient acute care hospitals and 24 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 16% in 2016, 17% in 2015 and 18% in 2014 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 7% in 2016, 11% in 2015 and 17% in 2014, of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We own 7 inpatient acute care hospitals and 4 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 16% in 2016, 15% in 2015 and 16% in 2014, of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 13% in 2016, 10% in 2015 and 11% in 2014, of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	California: We own 5 inpatient acute care hospitals and 8 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 11% in 2016, 11% in 2015 and 10% in 2014, of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 15% in 2016, 11% in 2015 and 8% in 2014, of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	The significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative, regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in Texas, Nevada and California.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We derive a significant portion of our revenue from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, the vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom are derived from governmental payors.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	rates paid or the scope of services covered by governmental payors in the United States or United Kingdom are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $100 million annually from each of Texas, California, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Virginia and Massachusetts, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors, including managed care providers, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Private payors, including managed care providers, increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Reductions or changes in Medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	On January 3, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the 2012 Act ).
352915_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The 2012 Act postponed for two months sequestration cuts mandated under the Budget Control Act of 2011.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The postponed sequestration cuts include a 2% annual reduction over ten years in Medicare spending to providers.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In order to offset the costs of the legislation, the 2012 Act reduces payments to other providers totaling almost $26 billion over ten years.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Approximately half of those funds will come from reductions in Medicare reimbursement to hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 has reduced certain sequestration-related budgetary cuts, spending reductions related to the Medicare program remain in place.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	On December 26, 2013, President Obama signed into law H.J. Res. 59, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which includes the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 ( the Act ).
352915_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, on February 15, 2014, Public Law 113-082 was enacted.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The Act and subsequent federal legislation achieves new savings by extending sequestration for mandatory programs including Medicare for another three years, through 2024.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Sources of Revenue-Medicare , for additional disclosure.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The 2012 Act includes a document and coding ( DCI ) adjustment and a reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital ( DSH ) payments.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Expected to save $10.5 billion over 10 years, the DCI adjustment decreases projected Medicare hospital payments for inpatient and overnight care through a downward adjustment in annual base payment increases.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	These reductions are meant to recoup what Medicare authorities consider to be overpayments to hospitals that occurred as a result of the transition to Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The reduction in Medicaid DSH payments is expected to save $4.2 billion over 10 years.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	This provision extends the changes regarding DSH payments established by the Legislation and determines future allotments off of the rebased level.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA ).
352915_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Reconciliation Act ), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the Legislation ), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Although it is expected that as a result of the Legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients, which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable, the Legislation makes a number of other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	It has been projected that the Legislation will result in a net reduction in Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals totaling $155 billion over 10 years.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Legislation revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning October 1, 2011 for Medicare Part B reimbursable items and services and beginning October 1, 2012 for Medicare inpatient hospital services.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The Legislation and subsequent revisions provide for reductions to both Medicare DSH and Medicaid DSH payments.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	The Medicare DSH reductions began in October, 2013 while the Medicaid DSH reductions are scheduled to begin in 2018.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Legislation implements a value-based purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or hospital-acquired condition rates.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	A 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government s ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the Legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Pursuant to that decision, the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing Medicaid funding.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Therefore, states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of federal Medicaid funding.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	As a result, many states, including Texas, have not expanded their Medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In addition, in King vs. Burwell , the Supreme Court decided in favor of the federal government s ability to subsidize premiums paid by certain eligible individuals that obtain health insurance policies through federally facilitated exchanges.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	A number of our hospitals operate in states that utilize federally facilitated exchanges.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The Supreme Court s decision in this case ultimately preserved the viability of federally facilitated exchanges.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	A different decision by the Supreme Court could have resulted in an increased number of uninsured patients generally, including an increase of uninsured patients treated at our hospitals located in these states.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The various provisions in the Legislation that directly or indirectly affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The impact of the Legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations, interpretive guidance and possible future legislation or legal challenges.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Certain Legislation provisions, such as those creating the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, create uncertainty in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Thus, we cannot predict the impact of the Legislation on our future reimbursement at this time and we can provide no assurance that the Legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The Legislation amends several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	While Congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found in violation of such law, the Legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act, although final regulations implementing this statutory requirement remain pending.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The Legislation also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	As discussed below, should the Legislation be repealed in its entirety, this aspect of the Legislation would also be repealed restoring physician ownership of hospitals and expansion right to its position and practice as it existed prior to the Legislation.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The impact of the Legislation on each of our hospitals may vary.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Because Legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years, we anticipate that many of the provisions in the Legislation may be subject to further revision.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Initiatives to repeal the Legislation, in whole or in part, to delay elements of implementation or funding, and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions have been persistent and may increase as a result of the 2016 election.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the Legislation and legal challenges to the Legislation are unknown.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Results of recent Congressional elections and the change of Presidential administrations beginning in 2017 could create a political environment in which substantial portions of the Legislation are repealed or revised.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Specifically, President Donald Trump s 100 Day Action Plan called for full repeal of the Legislation and its replacement with health savings accounts, cross-states sales of health insurance, and modifications to state-managed Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Nevertheless, prospects for rapid enactment of radical change in the health care regulatory landscape are not clear, and President Donald Trump has already indicated that popular provisions of the Legislation should be preserved.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P21_S7	It remains unclear what portions of the Legislation may remain, or whether any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally, and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on our hospitals, including their ability to compete with alternative healthcare services funded by such potential legislation, or for our hospitals to receive payment for services.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In accordance with our internal policies and procedures, as well as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical treatment (whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition, we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient s medical condition, within the facility s capability, or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital s written procedures.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our obligations under EMTALA may increase substantially going forward; CMS has sought stakeholder comments concerning the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively, but has yet to issue further guidance in response to that request.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly, or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under EMTALA is proposed and adopted, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	If we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price, patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In recent years, the number of quality measures that hospitals are required to report publicly has increased.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	CMS publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the Medicare program.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Additionally, the Legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish, update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If any of our hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys (or results that are lower than our competitors) or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volume could decline because patients may elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	This circumstance could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	An increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Collection of receivables from third-party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and deductibles.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S7	However, we also have substantial receivables due to us from certain state-based funding programs.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S8	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables, historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S9	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S10	Significant changes in business office operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S11	If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S12	Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P24_S13	The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals, and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As a result, most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom where the National Health Service (the NHS ) is the principal provider of healthcare services in the United Kingdom.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition to the NHS, we face competition in the United Kingdom from independent sector providers and other publicly funded entities for patients.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	As a result, the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals, and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	They may terminate their affiliation with us at any time.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	If we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P29_S5	It may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals are located.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P29_S7	Generally, the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P29_S8	The loss of one or more of these physicians, even if temporary, could cause a material reduction in our revenues, which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	If we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment, our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The technology used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and, as a result, manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	To compete effectively, we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry, patients may seek treatment from other providers and/or physicians may refer their patients to alternate sources, which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If we fail to continue to meet the meaningful use criteria related to electronic health record systems ( EHR ), our operations could be harmed.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Pursuant to HITECH regulations, hospitals that did not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 were subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S6	However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S9	We depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S10	We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S11	The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S12	This shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S13	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S14	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets, which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S15	We cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S16	If our general labor and related expenses increase, we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P31_S17	Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future, to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionized, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things: hospital billing practices and prices for services; relationships with physicians and other referral sources; adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services; ownership of facilities; qualifications of medical and support personnel; confidentiality, maintenance, privacy and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our facilities; operating policies and procedures, and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Among these laws are the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, ( HIPAA ), the federal anti-kickback statute and the provision of the Social Security Act commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	These laws, and particularly the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P33_S4	We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	A number of our current arrangements, including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	CMS published a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol, which is intended to allow providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark law.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the Stark law, there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the Stark Law or that self-disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Federal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that require us to implement and, in the future, may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient s health and related financial information.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Such privacy and security regulations impose extensive administrative, physical and technical requirements on us, restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information, provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Additionally, recent changes to HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements, including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	These laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	In the future, it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P36_S5	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws (see Item 3 Legal Proceedings ), or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P36_S6	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P36_S7	See Item 1 Business Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation .
352915_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our operations in the United Kingdom are also subject to a high level of regulation relating to o registration and licensing requirements employee regulation, clinical standards, environmental rules as well as other areas.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We are also subject to a highly regulated business environment, and failure to comply with the various laws and regulations, applicable to us could lead to substantial penalties, and other adverse effects on our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We are subject to occupational health, safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S4	We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Regulatory requirements affecting us include, but are not limited to, those covering: (i) air and water quality control; (ii) occupational health and safety (e.g., standards regarding blood-borne pathogens and ergonomics, etc.); (iii) waste management; (iv) the handling of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances; and (v) other hazardous materials.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S6	If we fail to comply with those standards, we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S7	We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S8	We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S9	Some of these actions may involve large claims, as well as significant defense costs.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S10	We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S11	In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may choose to negotiate a settlement.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P38_S12	Amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	All professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We believe that, based on our past experience and actuarial estimates, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	While we continuously monitor our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We may be subject to governmental investigations, regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The federal False Claims Act permits private parties to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits against companies.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Legal Proceedings for disclosure of current related matters.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The failure of certain employers, or the closure of certain facilities, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The economies in the non-urban communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	The failure of one or more large employer or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our hospitals operate, could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	The occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations, thereby harming our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P44_S4	If any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	All of our hospitals are deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Our growth strategy depends, in part, on acquisitions, and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	We may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not-for-profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P46_S5	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit healthcare companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P46_S6	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P46_S7	Also, suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that affect the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a healthcare facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation, increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals, increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria, any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital s results of operations, allocation of the purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S6	We may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire, which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S7	We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S8	We may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S9	Integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S10	In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by acquired hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S11	In addition, some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P47_S12	If we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire, operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals, our results of operations could be harmed.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We believe that value-based purchasing initiatives of both governmental and private payers tying financial incentives to quality and efficiency of care will increasingly affect the results of operations of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities and may negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet expected quality standards.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing in federal healthcare programs.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Medicare now requires providers to report certain quality measures in order to receive full reimbursement increases for inpatient and outpatient procedures that were previously awarded automatically.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive increased reimbursement payments, and hospitals that have excess readmissions for specified conditions will receive reduced reimbursement.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Furthermore, Medicare no longer pays hospitals additional amounts for the treatment of certain hospital-acquired conditions unless the conditions were present at admission.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, hospitals that rank in the worst 25% of all hospitals nationally for hospital acquired conditions in the previous year were subject to reduced Medicare reimbursements.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P50_S5	The ACA also prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for treating certain provider-preventable conditions.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	There is a trend among private payers toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services, as well.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Many large commercial payers require hospitals to report quality data, and several of these payers will not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet quality standards established by both governmental and private payers.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility s reputation could harm our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S4	We are subject to pending legal actions, purported stockholder class actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S5	We, our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions (see Item 3-Legal Proceedings ).
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S6	Defending ourselves against the allegations in the lawsuits and governmental investigations, or similar matters and any related publicity, could potentially entail significant costs and could require significant attention from our management.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S7	We are unable to predict the outcome of these matters or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any such loss; however, these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S8	We are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S9	Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our legal proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S10	In particular, government investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to material fines, penalties, damages payments or other sanctions, including exclusion from government healthcare programs.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P54_S11	Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted Certificates of Need, or CON, laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization review, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P57_S5	Our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors, including physicians clinical decisions and availability, payor programs shifting to a more outpatient-based environment, whether or not certain services are offered, seasonal and severe weather conditions, including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornados, earthquakes, current local economic and demographic changes.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P57_S6	In addition, technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our facilities could adversely impact our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If a pandemic or other public health crisis were to affect our markets, our business could be adversely affected.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Such a crisis could diminish the public trust in healthcare facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or that are treating (or have treated) patients affected by contagious diseases.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S3	If any of our facilities were involved in treating patients for such a contagious disease, other patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Further, a pandemic might adversely impact our business by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our facilities.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Although we have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, the potential impact of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease with respect to our markets or our facilities is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S6	A worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S7	Our patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance, which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S8	Worsening of economic conditions may result in a higher unemployment rate which may increase the number of individuals without health insurance.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S9	As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or an increase in services provided to uninsured patients.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S10	These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S11	In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $3.8 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S12	Should the revenues and financial results of our acute care and/or behavioral health care facilities be materially, unfavorably impacted due to, among other things, a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates, a continued rise in the unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P58_S13	Legal uncertainty or a worsening of the economic conditions in the United Kingdom could materially affect our business and future results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom affirmatively voted in a non-binding referendum in favor of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (the Brexit ) and it has been approved by vote of the British legislature.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Negotiations have commenced to determine the future terms of the United Kingdom s relationship with the European Union, including the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P59_S2	The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Brexit could lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P59_S4	The announcement of Brexit also created (and the actual exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union may create future) economic uncertainty, both in the United Kingdom and globally.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P59_S5	The actual exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P59_S6	Any of these effects of Brexit (and the announcement thereof), and others we cannot anticipate, could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P59_S7	Fluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	If we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future, the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P60_S3	In addition to our operating results, many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P60_S4	These factors include certain of the risks discussed herein, demographic changes, operating results of other hospital companies, changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts, speculation in the press or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, managed care contract negotiations and terminations, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We are exposed to currency exchange risk with respect to the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Pound sterling, because a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in Pounds.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	We monitor changes in our exposure to exchange rate risk.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S3	While we may elect to enter into hedging arrangements to protect our business against certain currency fluctuations, these hedging arrangements do not provide comprehensive protection, and our results of operations could be adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S4	We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S5	As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S6	While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S7	For example, we cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S8	We also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S9	If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S10	If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P61_S11	A cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of member privacy, or other negative impacts.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We rely extensively on our information technology ( IT ) systems to manage clinical and financial data, communicate with our patients, payors, vendors and other third parties and summarize and analyze operating results.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize electronic health records and to become meaningful users of health information technology pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	A cyber-attack that bypasses our IT security systems causing an IT security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws, loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption of our IT business systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of public health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Generally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P65_S3	The deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P65_S4	We require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P65_S5	We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P65_S6	We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	To fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P67_S4	The expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P67_S5	The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities, which could harm our business.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P68_S1	At December 31, 2016, 21.8 million shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P68_S3	To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the current holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P68_S4	In addition, from time-to-time our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P68_S5	Such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P68_S6	Conversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P68_S7	Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The right to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P69_S2	As of March 22, 2016, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 7.5% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect five members of the Board of Directors and constituted 86.4% of our general voting power as of that date.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P69_S3	As of March 22, 2016, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options) constituted 92.5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 13.6% of our general voting power as of that date.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P69_S4	As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).
352915_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	In the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock, which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his family, one of whom (Marc D. Miller) is also a director and officer of our company, and they can elect a majority of our company s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.
352915_17_ITEM1A_P70_S3	In addition, because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.
352915_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	We own various office buildings in King of Prussia and Wayne, Pennsylvania, Brentwood, Tennessee, Denton, Texas and Reno, Nevada.
352915_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	We hold an 80% ownership interest in this facility through a general partnership interest in a limited partnership.
352915_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	The remaining 20% ownership interest is held by an unaffiliated third-party.
352915_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	Real property leased from Universal Health Realty Income Trust.
352915_17_ITEM2_P3_S0	Edinburg Regional Medical Center/Children s Hospital, McAllen Medical Center, McAllen Heart Hospital, South Texas Behavioral Health Center, STHS ER at Mission and STHS ER at Weslaco are consolidated under one license operating as the South Texas Health System.
352915_17_ITEM2_P4_S0	We manage and own a noncontrolling interest of approximately 50% in the entity that operates this facility.
352915_17_ITEM2_P5_S0	We own minority interests in an LLC that owns and operates this center which is managed by a third-party.
352915_17_ITEM2_P6_S0	We own a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 50% in the entity that operates this facility that is managed by a third-party.
352915_17_ITEM2_P7_S0	We hold an 89% ownership interest in this facility through both general and limited partnership interests.
352915_17_ITEM2_P7_S1	The remaining 11% ownership interest is held by unaffiliated third parties.
352915_17_ITEM2_P8_S0	Land of this facility is leased.
352915_17_ITEM2_P9_S0	In late December, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division (the Cambian Adult Services ).
352915_17_ITEM2_P9_S1	The Cambian Adult Services division consists of 79 inpatient and 2 outpatient behavioral health facilities located in the U.K.
352915_17_ITEM2_P9_S2	The Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) in the U.K. is currently reviewing our acquisition of the Cambian Adult Services.
352915_17_ITEM2_P9_S3	We estimate that the CMA s review of our acquisition will be completed during the second quarter of 2017.
352915_17_ITEM2_P9_S4	However, until such review is completed, we are not permitted to integrate the Cambian Adult Services business into our existing businesses located in the U.K. Further, we can provide no assurance that the CMA will not require us to divest certain parts of the Cambian Adults Services division or certain parts of our existing business located in the U.K.
352915_17_ITEM2_P10_S0	We own or lease medical office buildings adjoining some of our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM2_P10_S1	We believe that the leases on the facilities, medical office buildings and other real estate leased or owned by us do not impose any material limitation on our operations.
352915_17_ITEM2_P10_S2	The aggregate lease payments on facilities leased by us were $74 million in 2016, $69 million in 2015 and $66 million in 2014.
352915_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations, regulatory matters and litigation, as outlined below.
352915_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013.
352915_17_ITEM3_P2_S2	We were advised that a qui tam action had been filed against Roxbury Treatment Center but the government declined to intervene and the case was dismissed.
352915_17_ITEM3_P3_S0	In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various documents from January, 2005 to the date of the subpoenas.
352915_17_ITEM3_P3_S1	In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records.
352915_17_ITEM3_P3_S2	In October, 2013, we were advised that the DOJ s Criminal Frauds Section had opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center.
352915_17_ITEM3_P3_S3	Subsequent subpoenas have since been issued to River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center requesting additional documentation.
352915_17_ITEM3_P4_S0	In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal regulations regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations.
352915_17_ITEM3_P4_S1	The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility.
352915_17_ITEM3_P4_S2	River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension.
352915_17_ITEM3_P4_S3	Notwithstanding, CMS continued the payment suspension.
352915_17_ITEM3_P4_S4	River Point Behavioral Health provided additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect.
352915_17_ITEM3_P4_S5	We cannot predict if and/or when the facility s suspended payments will resume.
352915_17_ITEM3_P4_S6	Although the operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015, the payment suspension has had a material adverse effect on the facility s results of operations and financial condition.
352915_17_ITEM3_P5_S0	In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_17_ITEM3_P5_S1	In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy.
352915_17_ITEM3_P6_S0	In March, 2014, a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) was served on the National Deaf Academy requesting documents and information from the facility from January 1, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_17_ITEM3_P6_S1	We have been advised by the government that the National Deaf Academy has been added to the facilities which are the subject of the coordinated investigation referenced above.
352915_17_ITEM3_P7_S0	In March, 2014, CIDs were served on Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Streamwood Behavioral Health requesting documents and information from those facilities from January, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_17_ITEM3_P7_S1	In September, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division advised us that they were expanding their investigation to include four additional facilities and were requesting production of documents from these facilities.
352915_17_ITEM3_P7_S2	These facilities are Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons by the Sea, and Turning Point Care Center.
352915_17_ITEM3_P8_S0	In December, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division requested that Salt Lake Behavioral Health produce documents responsive to the original subpoenas issued in February, 2013.
352915_17_ITEM3_P8_S1	In March, 2015, the OIG issued subpoenas to Central Florida Behavioral Hospital and University Behavioral Center requesting certain documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_17_ITEM3_P8_S2	In late March, 2015, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include UHS as a corporate entity arising out of the coordinated investigation of the facilities described above and, in particular, Hartgrove Hospital.
352915_17_ITEM3_P8_S3	In December, 2015, we were notified by the DOJ Civil Division that the civil investigation also includes Arbour Hospital, Arbour-Fuller Hospital, Pembroke Hospital and Westwood Lodge located in Massachusetts.
352915_17_ITEM3_P8_S4	To date, these facilities have not received any requests for documentation or other information.
352915_17_ITEM3_P9_S0	The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation referenced above is a False Claims Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities.
352915_17_ITEM3_P9_S1	At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure of the Company and/or named facilities, if any, in connection with these matters.
352915_17_ITEM3_P10_S0	In December, 2015, we were advised that the DOJ opened an investigation involving the El Paso Behavioral Health System in El Paso, Texas.
352915_17_ITEM3_P10_S1	The DOJ was investigating potential Stark law violations relating to arrangements between the facility and physician(s) at the facility.
352915_17_ITEM3_P11_S0	To our knowledge, this matter is not a part of the omnibus investigation referenced above.
352915_17_ITEM3_P11_S1	We have reached a settlement with the DOJ, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, concluding this matter.
352915_17_ITEM3_P12_S0	In January, 2016, we were notified that the Department of Justice opened an investigation of the South Texas Health System of a potential False Claim Act case regarding compensation paid to cardiologists pursuant to employment agreements entered into in 2005.
352915_17_ITEM3_P12_S1	In February, 2017, we were notified that the Department of Justice decided not to intervene in an under seal qui tam case and filed a notice of declination.
352915_17_ITEM3_P12_S2	Further, we have been informed that the relator is dismissing the case.
352915_17_ITEM3_P13_S0	Litigation: U.S. ex rel Escobar v. Universal Health Services, Inc.
352915_17_ITEM3_P14_S0	This is a False Claims Act case filed against Universal Health Services, Inc., UHS of Delaware, Inc. and HRI Clinics, Inc.
352915_17_ITEM3_P14_S1	d/b/a Arbour Counseling Services in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
352915_17_ITEM3_P14_S2	This qui tam action primarily alleges that Arbour Counseling Services failed to appropriately supervise certain clinical providers in contravention of regulatory requirements and the submission of claims to Medicaid were subsequently improper.
352915_17_ITEM3_P14_S3	Relators make other claims of improper billing to Medicaid associated with alleged failures of Arbour Counseling to comply with state regulations.
352915_17_ITEM3_P15_S0	The U.S. Attorney s Office and the Massachusetts Attorney General s Office initially declined to intervene.
352915_17_ITEM3_P15_S1	UHS filed a motion to dismiss and the trial court originally granted the motion dismissing the case.
352915_17_ITEM3_P15_S2	The First Circuit Court of Appeals ( First Circuit ) reversed the trial court s dismissal of the case.
352915_17_ITEM3_P15_S3	The United States Supreme Court subsequently vacated the First Circuit s opinion and remanded the case for further consideration under the new legal standards established by the Supreme Court for False Claims Act cases.
352915_17_ITEM3_P15_S4	During the 4 th quarter of 2016, the First Circuit issued a revised opinion upholding their reversal of the trial court s dismissal.
352915_17_ITEM3_P15_S5	The case was then remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.
352915_17_ITEM3_P15_S6	In January 2017, the U.S. Attorney s Office and Massachusetts Attorney General s Office advised of the potential for intervention in the case.
352915_17_ITEM3_P16_S0	We are defending this case vigorously.
352915_17_ITEM3_P16_S1	At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_17_ITEM3_P17_S0	Heed v. Universal Health Services, Inc., et al.
352915_17_ITEM3_P18_S0	In December 2016 a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against UHS, and certain UHS officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws.
352915_17_ITEM3_P18_S1	Plaintiff alleges that defendants violated federal securities laws relating to the disclosures made in public filings associated with practices at our behavioral health facilities.
352915_17_ITEM3_P18_S2	Although we have not been served with the complaint at this time, we deny liability and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.
352915_17_ITEM3_P18_S3	At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_17_ITEM3_P19_S0	Other Matters: In late September, 2015, many hospitals in Pennsylvania, including seven of our behavioral health care hospitals located in the state, received letters from the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (the Department ) demanding repayment of allegedly excess Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments ( DSH ) for the federal fiscal year 2011 ( FFY2011 ) amounting to approximately $4 million in the aggregate.
352915_17_ITEM3_P19_S1	In September, 2016, we received similar requests for repayment for alleged DSH overpayments for FFY2012.
352915_17_ITEM3_P19_S2	We filed administrative appeals for all of our facilities contesting the recoupment efforts for FFYs 2011 and 2012 as we believe the Department s calculation methodology is inaccurate and conflicts with applicable federal and state laws and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM3_P19_S3	The Department has agreed to postpone the recoupment of the state s share of the DSH payments until all hospital appeals are resolved but recently started recoupment of the federal share.
352915_17_ITEM3_P19_S4	If the Department is ultimately successful in its demand related to FFY2011 and FFY2012, it could take similar action with regards to FFY2013 and FFY2014.
352915_17_ITEM3_P20_S0	Due to a change in the Pennsylvania Medicaid State Plan and implementation of a CMS-approved Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver, we do not believe the methodology applied by the Department to FFY2011 and FFY2012 is applicable to reimbursements received for Medicaid services provided after January 1, 2015 by our behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania.
352915_17_ITEM3_P20_S1	We can provide no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our legal and administrative appeals related to the Department s repayment demands.
352915_17_ITEM3_P20_S2	If our legal and administrative appeals are unsuccessful, our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by these repayments.
352915_17_ITEM3_P21_S0	Matters Relating to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ): The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of PSI) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010.
352915_17_ITEM3_P22_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_17_ITEM3_P23_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_17_ITEM3_P23_S1	The requested documents were collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_17_ITEM3_P23_S2	Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July, 2011 requesting additional documents, which have also been delivered to the DOJ.
352915_17_ITEM3_P23_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_17_ITEM3_P24_S0	present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S5	We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry which subjects us to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S6	These claims or suits include claims for damages for personal injuries, medical malpractice, commercial/contractual disputes, wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians staff privileges, and employment related claims.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S7	In addition, health care companies are subject to investigations and/or actions by various state and federal governmental agencies or those bringing claims on their behalf.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S8	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations against healthcare providers concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes as well as compliance with clinical and operational regulations.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S9	Currently, and from time to time, we and some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries in the form of subpoenas, Civil Investigative Demands, audits and other document requests from various federal and state agencies.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S10	These inquiries can lead to notices and/or actions including repayment obligations from state and federal government agencies associated with potential non-compliance with laws and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM3_P25_S11	Further, the federal False Claim Act allows private individuals to bring lawsuits (qui tam actions) against healthcare providers that submit claims for payments to the government.
352915_17_ITEM3_P26_S0	Various states have also adopted similar statutes.
352915_17_ITEM3_P26_S1	When such a claim is filed, the government will investigate the matter and decide if they are going to intervene in the pending case.
352915_17_ITEM3_P26_S2	These qui tam lawsuits are placed under seal by the court to comply with the False Claims Act s requirements.
352915_17_ITEM3_P26_S3	If the government chooses not to intervene, the private individual(s) can proceed independently on behalf of the government.
352915_17_ITEM3_P27_S0	Health care providers that are found to violate the False Claims Act may be subject to substantial monetary fines/penalties as well as face potential exclusion from participating in government health care programs or be required to comply with Corporate Integrity Agreements as a condition of a settlement of a False Claim Act matter.
352915_17_ITEM3_P28_S0	In September 2014, the Criminal Division of the DOJ, announced that all qui tam cases will be shared with their Division to determine if a parallel criminal investigation should be opened.
352915_17_ITEM3_P28_S1	The DOJ has also announced an intention to pursue civil and criminal actions against individuals within a company as well as the corporate entity or entities.
352915_17_ITEM3_P28_S2	In addition, health care facilities are subject to monitoring by state and federal surveyors to ensure compliance with program Conditions of Participation.
352915_17_ITEM3_P28_S3	In the event a facility is found to be out of compliance with a Condition of Participation and unable to remedy the alleged deficiency(s), the facility faces termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or compliance with a System Improvement Agreement to remedy deficiencies and ensure compliance.
352915_17_ITEM3_P29_S0	The laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry are complex covering, among other things, government healthcare participation requirements, licensure, certification and accreditation, privacy of patient information, reimbursement for patient services as well as fraud and abuse compliance.
352915_17_ITEM3_P29_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and expanding.
352915_17_ITEM3_P29_S2	Further, the Affordable Care Act has added additional obligations on healthcare providers to report and refund overpayments by government healthcare programs and authorizes the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.
352915_17_ITEM3_P29_S3	We monitor our business and have developed an ethics and compliance program with respect to these complex laws, rules and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM3_P29_S4	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with government regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with the sanctions referenced above which include fines, penalties and/or substantial damages, repayment obligations, payment suspensions, licensure revocation, and expulsion from government healthcare programs.
352915_17_ITEM3_P29_S5	Even if we were to ultimately prevail in any action brought against us or our facilities or in responding to any inquiry, such action or inquiry could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_17_ITEM3_P29_S6	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_17_ITEM3_P29_S7	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_17_ITEM3_P29_S8	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_17_ITEM3_P29_S9	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.
352915_17_ITEM3_P30_S0	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_17_ITEM3_P30_S1	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class B Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

352915_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	In February, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $400 million increase to our stock repurchase program, which increased the aggregate authorization to $800 million from the previous $400 million mentioned above.
352915_17_ITEM5_P2_S2	There is no expiration date for our stock repurchase programs.

352915_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview Our principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals and outpatient facilities and behavioral health care facilities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	As of February 28, 2017, we owned and/or operated 319 inpatient facilities and 33 outpatient and other facilities including the following located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands: Acute care facilities located in the U.S.:
352915_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	4 outpatient surgery/cancer care centers 1 surgical hospital.
352915_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Behavioral health care facilities (293 inpatient facilities and 24 outpatient facilities): Located in the U.S.:
352915_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	20 outpatient behavioral health care facilities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	2 outpatient behavioral health care facilities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands:
352915_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	2 outpatient behavioral health care facility.
352915_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	In late December, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division (the Cambian Adult Services ) for a total purchase price of approximately $473 million.
352915_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Cambian Adult Services division consists of 79 inpatient and 2 outpatient behavioral health facilities located in the U.K.
352915_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) in the U.K. is currently reviewing our acquisition of the Cambian Adult Services.
352915_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	We estimate that the CMA s review of our acquisition will be completed during the second quarter of 2017.
352915_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	However, until such review is completed, we are not permitted to integrate the Cambian Adult Services business into our existing businesses located in the U.K. Further, we can provide no assurance that the CMA will not require us to divest certain parts of the Cambian Adults Services division or certain parts of our existing business located in the U.K. As a percentage of our consolidated net revenues, net revenues from our acute care hospitals, outpatient facilities and commercial health insurer accounted for 52% during 2016 and 51% during each of 2015 and 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P7_S5	Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities and commercial health insurer accounted for 48% of our consolidated net revenues during 2016 and 49% during each of 2015 and 2014.

352915_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors You should carefully review the information contained in this Annual Report, and should particularly consider any risk factors that we set forth in this Annual Report and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	In this Annual Report, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance.
352915_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, and statements of our goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.
352915_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	projects and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.
352915_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	In evaluating those statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks related to healthcare industry trends and those set forth herein in Item 1A. Risk Factors .
352915_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved.
352915_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.
352915_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Such factors include, among other things, the following:
352915_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	an increasing number of legislative initiatives have been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level.
352915_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters as disclosed in Item 3.
352915_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	as discussed below in Sources of Revenue, we receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $100 million annually from each of Texas, California, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Virginia and Massachusetts); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including Texas, Mississippi, Illinois, Oklahoma, Nevada, Arkansas, California and Indiana, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina.
352915_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	in March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA ) were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade.
352915_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Initiatives to repeal the ACA, in whole or in part, to delay elements of implementation or funding, and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions, have been persistent and may increase as a result of the 2016 election.
352915_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	The ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the ACA and legal challenges to the ACA are unknown.
352915_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	Results of recent Congressional elections and the change of Presidential administrations beginning in 2017 could create a political environment in which substantial portions of the ACA are repealed or revised.
352915_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	Specifically, President Donald Trump s 100 Day Action Plan called for full repeal of the ACA and its replacement with health savings accounts, cross-states sales of health insurance, and modifications to state-managed Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P17_S4	Nevertheless, prospects for rapid enactment of radical change in the health care regulatory landscape are not clear, and President Donald Trump has already indicated that popular provisions of the ACA should be preserved.
352915_17_ITEM7_P17_S5	It remains unclear what portions of the ACA may remain, or what any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation.
352915_17_ITEM7_P17_S6	Any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally, and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations in July, 2010 implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore were not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.
352915_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the Joint Committee ), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (annual reduction of approximately $36 million to our Medicare net revenues) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P20_S4	The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, continued the 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 Act.

352915_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
352915_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in Note 1 to the financial statements.
352915_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following: Revenue Recognition:
352915_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 32% of our net patient revenues during 2016, 34% during 2015 and 38% during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 56% of our net patient revenues during 2016, 54% during 2015 and 52% during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_17_ITEM7_P25_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_17_ITEM7_P25_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_17_ITEM7_P25_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_17_ITEM7_P25_S7	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_17_ITEM7_P25_S8	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
352915_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of December 31, 2016, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.
352915_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_17_ITEM7_P29_S6	Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_17_ITEM7_P29_S7	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_17_ITEM7_P29_S8	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_17_ITEM7_P29_S9	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_17_ITEM7_P29_S10	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Effective January 1, 2016, our hospitals in certain states in which we operate reduced the charity care eligibility threshold to less than the federal poverty guidelines.
352915_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states.
352915_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration.
352915_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned.
352915_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered.
352915_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible.
352915_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient s Medicaid eligibility.
352915_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	When the patient s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending.
352915_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Although the patient s ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2016, 2015 or 2014 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
352915_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in uninsured discounts amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_17_ITEM7_P34_S4	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable.
352915_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $410 million and $399 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	Approximately 85% during each of 2016 and 2015 of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our acute care hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	Shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of December 31, 2016 and 2015: As of December 31, 2016:
352915_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
352915_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	The regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and ended as late as 2016 for Medicare and can end as late as 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
352915_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Medicare EHR incentive payments: Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31st, we have recognized Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria.
352915_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Medicaid EHR incentive payments: Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria.
352915_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria.
352915_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks: We provide for self-insured risks including general and professional liability claims, workers compensation claims and healthcare and dental claims.
352915_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_17_ITEM7_P41_S5	In addition, we also: (i) own commercial health insurers headquartered in Reno, Nevada, and Puerto Rico and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_17_ITEM7_P41_S6	The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_17_ITEM7_P41_S7	Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM7_P41_S8	See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Commitments and Contingencies , for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability, workers compensation liability and property insurance.
352915_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	We have designated October 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of October 1, 2016 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	There were also no impairments during 2015 or 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	During 2015, we changed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles testing date from September 1st to October 1st.
352915_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Management believes that this voluntary change in accounting method is preferable as it aligns the annual impairment testing date with our annual budgeting process.
352915_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	The 2015 change in annual testing date did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge.
352915_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	See Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates below for discussion of our effective tax rates during each of the last three years.
352915_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements: For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements, please see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Accounting Standards as included in this Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	The following table summarizes our results of operations, and is used in the discussion below, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015:
352915_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Net revenues increased 8% or $723 million to $9.77 billion during 2016 as compared to $9.04 billion during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	The increase was primarily attributable to:
352915_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	other combined net increase of $181 million consisting primarily of the revenues generated at 4 behavioral health care hospitals acquired in the U.K. in connection with our acquisition of Alpha Hospital Holdings Limited ( Alpha ) during the third quarter of 2015, and 4 inpatient facilities and 8 outpatient centers acquired during the fourth quarter of 2015 as result of our acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network, LLC ( Foundations ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $10 million to $1.16 billion during 2016 as compared to $1.15 billion during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	The net increase in our income before income taxes during 2016, as compared to 2015, was due to the following:
352915_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	$17 million of other combined net decreases.
352915_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Net income attributable to UHS increased $22 million to $702 million during 2016 as compared to $681 million during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	a decrease of $14 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded on the $36 million increase in pre-tax income ($10 million increase in income before income taxes plus the $26 million increase in income resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests).
352915_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014:
352915_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	Net revenues increased 10% or $838 million to $9.04 billion during 2015 as compared to $8.21 billion during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	The increase was primarily attributable to:
352915_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	other combined net increase of $286 million consisting primarily of: (i) the revenues generated at 21 behavioral health care facilities acquired in the U.K. between September, 2014 and December, 2015; (ii) a full year of revenues generated at a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada, that was acquired in June, 2014, and; (iii) the revenues generated at the behavioral health care facilities acquired during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 in connection with the Alpha and Foundations transactions.
352915_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $216 million to $1.15 billion during 2015 as compared to $930 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	Included in our income before income taxes during 2015, as compared to 2014, was the following:
352915_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	$9 million of other combined net decreases.
352915_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Net income attributable to UHS increased $135 million to $681 million during 2015 as compared to $545 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	a decrease of $71 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from the income tax provision on the $206 million increase in pre-tax income ($216 million increase in income before income taxes less the $10 million decrease in income resulting from an increase in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests).
352915_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	We believe that providing our results on a Same Facility basis (which is a non-GAAP measure), which includes the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance.
352915_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Our Same Facility results also neutralize (if applicable) the impact of the EHR applications, the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.
352915_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	Our Same Facility basis results reflected on the tables below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below Sources of Revenue-Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P62_S3	However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under All Acute Care Hospital Services .
352915_17_ITEM7_P62_S4	The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses.
352915_17_ITEM7_P62_S5	-K. The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care hospital services on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	On a same facility basis during 2016, as compared to 2015, net revenues from our acute care services increased $430 million or 9%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Income before income taxes increased $47 million or 9% to $586 million or 11.8% of net revenues during 2016 as compared to $539 million or 11.8% of net revenues during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	Inpatient admissions to our acute care hospitals owned during both years increased 4.3% during 2016, as compared to 2015, while patient days increased 2.4%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P63_S3	Adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 5.2% and adjusted patient days increased 3.3% during 2016, as compared to 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P63_S4	The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.6 days during 2016 and 4.7 days during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 2.7% during 2016, as compared to 2015, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 4.6% during 2016, as compared to 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2016 and 2015.

352915_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Dollar amounts below are reflected in thousands.
352915_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	During 2016, as compared to 2015, net revenues generated from our acute care hospital services increased $480 million or 10% to $5.11 billion due primarily to: (i) a $430 million, or 9%, increase same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) other combined net increase of $50 million due primarily to the net revenues generated at the two above-mentioned acute care hospitals located in Nevada that were acquired or opened during 2016, and an increase in provider tax assessments.
352915_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Income before income taxes increased $30 million to $550 million or 10.8% of net revenues during 2016 as compared to $520 million or 11.2% of net revenues during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	Included in these results are the following:
352915_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	a net other combined decrease of $8 million consisting primarily of the operating losses incurred at the newly constructed, 130-bed acute care hospital located in Henderson, Nevada, that was completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Uncompensated care (charity care and uninsured discounts):
352915_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
352915_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Generally, patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Effective January 1, 2016, our hospitals in certain states in which we operate reduced the charity care eligibility threshold to less than the federal poverty guidelines.
352915_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	During 2016, as compared to 2015 and 2014, this change resulted in an increase in the charity care component of our total uncompensated care and a decrease in the uninsured discount component.
352915_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	The provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals was approximately $628 million during 2016, $631 million during 2015 and $590 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care hospital services on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in thousands):

352915_17_ITEM7_P81_S5	The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 76% during each of 2016 and 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P81_S6	On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities increased 1.4% during 2016, as compared to 2015, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.5% during 2016, as compared to 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	In certain markets in which we operate, the ability of our behavioral health facilities to fully meet the demand for their services has been unfavorably impacted by a shortage of clinicians which includes psychiatrists, nurses and mental health technicians which has, at times, caused the closure of a portion of available bed capacity.
352915_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	As a result, we have instituted certain initiatives at the impacted facilities designed to enhance recruitment and retention of clinical staff.
352915_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	Although we believe the impact on these facilities is temporary, we can provide no assurance that these factors will not continue to unfavorably impact our patient volumes.
352915_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our behavioral health care services during 2016 and 2015 which includes our behavioral health results on a same facility basis, the impact of the facilities acquired or opened within the previous twelve months, and the impact of provider tax assessments which increased net revenues and other operating expenses but had no impact on income before income taxes (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	During 2016, as compared to 2015, net revenues generated from our behavioral health care services increased 6% or $245 million to $4.65 billion during 2016 as compared to $4.40 billion during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	The increase in net revenues was attributable to: (i) $112 million or 3% increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) $133 million of other combined increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at the facilities acquired in the Alpha and Foundations transactions.
352915_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	Income before income taxes increased $9 million or 1% to $1.03 billion or 22.2% of net revenues during 2016 as compared to $1.02 billion or 23.2% of net revenues during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P84_S3	The increase in income before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to:
352915_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	a combined net increase of $19 million related primarily to the income generated at the facilities acquired in the Alpha and Foundations transactions.

352915_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	During 2015, as compared to 2014, net revenues generated from our behavioral health care services increased 10% or $388 million to $4.40 billion during 2015 as compared to $4.01 billion during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	The increase in net revenues was attributable to: (i) $195 million or 5% increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) $193 million of other combined increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at 21 behavioral health care facilities acquired in the U.K. between September of 2014 and December of 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	Income before income taxes increased $78 million or 8% to $1.02 billion or 23.2% of net revenues during 2015 as compared to $944 million or 23.5% of net revenues during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P89_S3	The increase in income before income taxes generated from our behavioral health care services was attributable to:
352915_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	a $9 million net decrease resulting from the reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves applicable to our behavioral health facilities recorded during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Sources of Revenue Overview: We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services.
352915_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital.
352915_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.
352915_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis.
352915_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.
352915_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage.
352915_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year.
352915_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue.
352915_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts.
352915_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:
352915_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future.
352915_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.
352915_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	In March, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872, P.L. 111-152), (the Reconciliation Act ) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), (the ACA ), were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens as well as material revisions to the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below.
352915_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	Initiatives to repeal the ACA, in whole or in part, to delay elements of implementation or funding, and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions, have been persistent and may increase as a result of the 2016 election.
352915_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	The ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the ACA and legal challenges to the ACA are unknown.
352915_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	Results of recent Congressional elections and the change of Presidential administrations beginning in 2017 could create a political environment in which substantial portions of the ACA are repealed or revised.
352915_17_ITEM7_P99_S3	Specifically, President Donald Trump s 100 Day Action Plan called for full repeal of the ACA and its replacement with health savings accounts, cross-states sales of health insurance, and modifications to state-managed Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P99_S4	Nevertheless, prospects for rapid enactment of radical change in the health care regulatory landscape are not clear, and President Donald Trump has already indicated that popular provisions of the ACA should be preserved.
352915_17_ITEM7_P99_S5	It remains unclear what portions of the ACA may remain, or what any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation.
352915_17_ITEM7_P99_S6	Any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally, and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM7_P99_S7	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on our hospitals, including their ability to compete with alternative healthcare services funded by such potential legislation, or for our hospitals to receive payment for services.
352915_17_ITEM7_P99_S8	The following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years for: (i) our Acute Care and Behavioral Health Care Facilities Combined; (ii) our Acute Care Facilities, and; (iii) our Behavioral Health Care Facilities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.
352915_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease.
352915_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P101_S2	Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_17_ITEM7_P101_S3	Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.
352915_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge.
352915_17_ITEM7_P102_S2	The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s Medicare severity diagnosis related group ( MS-DRG ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P102_S3	Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis.
352915_17_ITEM7_P102_S4	The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care.
352915_17_ITEM7_P102_S5	This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG.
352915_17_ITEM7_P102_S6	The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity.
352915_17_ITEM7_P102_S7	While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patient s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.
352915_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1.
352915_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the hospital market basket index, gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services.
352915_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM7_P103_S3	In August, 2016, CMS published its IPPS 2017 final payment rule which provides for a 2.7% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_17_ITEM7_P103_S4	Hospital ( DSH ) payment changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 0.95%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P103_S5	Including the estimated decreases to our DSH payments (approximating -0.8%) and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall decrease from the final IPPS 2017 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017) will approximate -0.2%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P103_S6	This projected impact from the IPPS 2017 final rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as discussed below.
352915_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	In July, 2015, CMS published its IPPS 2016 final payment rule which provides for a 2.4% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required Medicare DSH payment changes and decrease to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 1.1%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	Including the decreases to our Medicare DSH payments (approximating 1.6%) and certain other adjustments, our overall decrease from the final IPPS 2016 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016) was approximately -0.1%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P104_S3	The impact from the IPPS 2016 final rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as discussed below.
352915_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	In August, 2014, CMS published its IPPS 2015 payment rule which provides for a 2.9% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	Including the decreases to our DSH payments ( 1.9%) and Medicare Outlier threshold ( 0.6%), our overall decrease from the IPPS 2015 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015) was approximately ( 1.9%), or approximately $13 million annually.
352915_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	The impact from the IPPS 2015 rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, as discussed below.
352915_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	In August, 2013, CMS published its final IPPS 2014 payment rule which expanded CMS s policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard.
352915_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	Specifically, it would require Medicare s external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services for at least two midnights (the Two Midnight rule).
352915_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	A benefit on a case-by case basis for rare and unusual exceptions based the presence of certain clinical factors.
352915_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	CMS also announced in the final rule that, effective October 1, 2015, Quality Improvement Organizations ( QIOs ) will conduct reviews of short inpatient stay reviews rather than Medicare Administrative Contractors.
352915_17_ITEM7_P108_S2	Additionally, CMS also announced that Recovery Audit Contractors ( RACs ) resumed patient status reviews for claims with admission dates of January 1, 2016 or later, and the agency indicates that RACs will conduct these reviews focused on providers with high denial rates that are referred by the QIOs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	In its IPPS 2017 final payment rule, CMS: (i) reversed the Two-Midnight rule s 0.2% reduction in hospital payments, and; (ii) implemented a temporary one-time increase of 0.8% in FFY2017 payments to offset cuts in the preceding fiscal years affected by the prior 0.2% reduction.
352915_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_17_ITEM7_P110_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_17_ITEM7_P110_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year.
352915_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, continued the 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 Act.
352915_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	For federal fiscal year 2015, the aggregate annual sequestration reduction to our Medicare net revenues was approximately $36 million with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P111_S2	On January 2, 2013 ATRA was enacted which, among other things, includes a requirement for CMS to recoup $11 billion from hospitals from Medicare IPPS rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017.
352915_17_ITEM7_P111_S3	The recoupment relates to IPPS documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by CMS.
352915_17_ITEM7_P111_S4	Both the 2014 and 2015 IPPS final rules include a -0.8% recoupment adjustment.
352915_17_ITEM7_P111_S5	CMS has included the same 0.8% recoupment adjustment in fiscal year 2016 and has included a 1.5% recoupment adjustment in federal fiscal year 2017 in order to recover the entire $11 billion.
352915_17_ITEM7_P111_S6	This adjustment is reflected in the IPPS estimated impact amounts noted above.
352915_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	On April 16, 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted and an anticipated 3.2% payment increase in 2018 is scheduled to be phased in at 0.5% per year over 6 years beginning in fiscal year 2018.
352915_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	Inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program are paid under a Psychiatric Prospective Payment System ( Psych PPS ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	Medicare payments to psychiatric hospitals are based on a prospective per diem rate with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics.
352915_17_ITEM7_P113_S2	The Psych PPS also contains provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department.
352915_17_ITEM7_P113_S3	In July, 2016, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2017.
352915_17_ITEM7_P113_S4	Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 2.3% compared to federal fiscal year 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7_P113_S5	This amount includes the effect of the 2.8% market basket update less a 0.2% adjustment as required by the ACA and a 0.3% productivity adjustment.
352915_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	In July, 2015, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units increased by approximately 1.7% compared to federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P114_S2	This amount includes the effect of the 2.4% market basket update less a 0.2% adjustment as required by the ACA and a 0.5% productivity adjustment.
352915_17_ITEM7_P114_S3	The final rule also updates the Inpatient Psychiatric Quality Reporting Program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update.
352915_17_ITEM7_P114_S4	In July, 2014, CMS published it Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P114_S5	Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units increased by approximately 2.1% compared to federal fiscal year 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	of the 2.9% market basket update adjusted by the ACA required 0.3% reduction and the -0.5% productivity adjustment.
352915_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	The final rule also updates the Inpatient Psychiatric Quality Reporting Program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update.
352915_17_ITEM7_P115_S2	In November, 2016, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2017.
352915_17_ITEM7_P115_S3	The hospital market basket increase is 2.7%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P115_S4	The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.3% and 0.75% reduction to the 2017 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2017 OPPS market basket update at 1.65%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P115_S5	When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2017 will aggregate to a net increase of 1.5% which includes a -1.3% decrease to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates.
352915_17_ITEM7_P115_S6	When the behavioral health division s partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, we estimate that our Medicare 2017 OPPS payments will result in a 2.1% increase in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	In October, 2015, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7_P116_S1	The hospital market basket increase is 2.8%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P116_S2	The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2016 OPPS market basket.
352915_17_ITEM7_P116_S3	Additionally, CMS also proposes a reduction of 2.0%, which the CMS claims is necessary to eliminate $1 billion in excess laboratory payments that CMS packaged into OPPS payment rates in 2014 resulting in a 2016 OPPS market basket update at -0.3%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P116_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2016 aggregated to a net decrease of approximately -0.2% which includes a 7.0% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates.
352915_17_ITEM7_P116_S5	When the behavioral health division s partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, our Medicare 2016 OPPS payments resulted in a -1.6% decrease in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	In October, 2014, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P117_S1	The hospital market basket increase is 2.9%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P117_S2	The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2015 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2015 OPPS market basket update at 2.2%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P117_S3	In the final rule, CMS will reduce the 2015 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P117_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS for 2015 aggregated to a net increase of approximately 0.2%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P117_S5	Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2015 was approximately 1.5%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care.
352915_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM7_P118_S2	Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_17_ITEM7_P118_S3	In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid.
352915_17_ITEM7_P118_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P118_S5	We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $100 million annually from each of Texas, California, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Virginia and Massachusetts, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	The ACA substantially increases the federally and state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	However, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of the ACA requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding.
352915_17_ITEM7_P119_S2	Accordingly, many states in which we operate have not expanded Medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level.
352915_17_ITEM7_P119_S3	Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in 2018, as discussed below.
352915_17_ITEM7_P119_S4	We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs:
352915_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	We incur health-care related taxes ( Provider Taxes ) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services.
352915_17_ITEM7_P121_S1	Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	As outlined below, we derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments.
352915_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	Included in these Provider Tax programs are reimbursements received in connection with Texas Uncompensated Care/Upper Payment Limit program ( UC/UPL ) and Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments program ( DSRIP ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P123_S1	Additional disclosure related to the Texas UC/UPL and DSRIP programs is provided below.
352915_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	Texas Uncompensated Care/Upper Payment Limit Payments:
352915_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Hidalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in Medicaid supplemental payment Section 1115 Waiver indigent care programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P125_S1	Section 1115 Waiver Uncompensated Care ( UC ) payments replace the former Upper Payment Limit ( UPL ) payments.
352915_17_ITEM7_P125_S2	These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties.
352915_17_ITEM7_P125_S3	Our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM7_P125_S4	The supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer ( IGT ) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM7_P125_S5	However, the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any IGT on the amount of any private hospital s indigent care obligation.
352915_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	On September 30, 2014, CMS notified the Texas Health and Human Services Commission ( THHSC ) that it was deferring the federal matching funds (approximately $75 million) on Texas Medicaid UC payments made to providers in certain counties.
352915_17_ITEM7_P126_S1	A deferral results in CMS withholding funds from the state representing the federal portion of Medicaid payments the state has previously made to providers.
352915_17_ITEM7_P126_S2	A deferral goes into effect when CMS questions the basis for all or part of the amount of Medicaid payments made to certain providers, and remains in place subject to CMS s final determination.
352915_17_ITEM7_P126_S3	Our Texas hospitals are not located in the geographic areas impacted by this deferral.
352915_17_ITEM7_P126_S4	On January 7, 2015, CMS removed the aforementioned deferral but indicated they will continue their review and assessment of the underlying UC financing arrangements as to ensure their compliance with the applicable federal regulations and eligibility for federal matching dollars.
352915_17_ITEM7_P126_S5	In May, 2015, THHSC was informed by CMS that current private-hospital funding arrangements can continue for waiver-payment dates through August, 2017, without risk of disallowance of federal matching funds on the same grounds questioned in last year s deferral.
352915_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	For state fiscal year 2017, Texas Medicaid will continue to operate under a CMS-approved Section 1115 five-year Medicaid waiver demonstration program extended by CMS for fifteen months to December 31, 2017.
352915_17_ITEM7_P127_S1	During the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012, the THHSC transitioned away from UPL payments to new waiver incentive payment programs, UC and DSRIP payments.
352915_17_ITEM7_P127_S2	During the first year of transition, which commenced on October 1, 2011, THHSC made payments to Medicaid UPL recipient providers that received payments during the state s prior fiscal year.
352915_17_ITEM7_P127_S3	During demonstration years two through seven (October 1, 2012 through December 31, 2017), THHSC has, and will continue to, make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM7_P127_S4	Supplemental payments are also subject to aggregate statewide caps based on CMS approved Medicaid waiver amounts.
352915_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments: In addition, the Texas Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver includes a DSRIP pool to incentivize hospitals and other providers to transform their service delivery practices to improve quality, health status, patient experience, coordination, and cost-effectiveness.
352915_17_ITEM7_P128_S1	DSRIP pool payments are incentive payments to hospitals and other providers that develop programs or strategies to enhance access to health care, increase the quality of care, the cost-effectiveness of care provided and the health of the patients and families served.
352915_17_ITEM7_P128_S2	In May, 2014, CMS formally approved specific DSRIP projects for certain of our hospitals for demonstration years 3 to 5 (our facilities did not materially participate in the DSRIP pool during demonstration years 1 or 2).
352915_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	DSRIP payments are contingent on the hospital meeting certain pre-determined milestones, metrics and clinical outcomes.
352915_17_ITEM7_P129_S1	Additionally, DSRIP payments are contingent on a governmental entity providing an IGT for the non-federal share component of the DSRIP payment.
352915_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	THHSC generally approves DSRIP reported metrics, milestones and clinical outcomes on a semi-annual basis in June and December.
352915_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	Summary of Amounts Related To The Above-Mentioned Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs: The following table summarizes the revenues, Provider Taxes and net benefit related to each of the above-mentioned Medicaid supplemental programs for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P131_S1	The Provider Taxes are recorded in other operating expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as included herein.
352915_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	We estimate that our aggregate net benefit from the Texas and various other state Medicaid supplemental payment programs will approximate $145 million (net of Provider Taxes of $159 million) during the year ended December 31, 2017.
352915_17_ITEM7_P132_S1	This estimate is based upon various terms and conditions that are out of our control including, but not limited to, the states / CMS s continued approval of the programs and the applicable hospital district or county making IGTs consistent with 2016 levels.
352915_17_ITEM7_P132_S2	Future changes to these terms and conditions could materially reduce our net benefit derived from the programs which could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM7_P132_S3	In addition, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	Texas and South Carolina Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a DSH adjustment.
352915_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments.
352915_17_ITEM7_P134_S1	Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.
352915_17_ITEM7_P134_S2	Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas and South Carolina s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state s DSH fund.
352915_17_ITEM7_P134_S3	The South Carolina and Texas DSH programs were renewed for each state s 2017 DSH fiscal year (covering the period of October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017).
352915_17_ITEM7_P134_S4	During the second quarter of 2015, the THHSC finalized DSH payments for federal fiscal year 2014 which resulted in a $6 million annualized reduction in our Texas Medicaid DSH payments retroactive to October, 2013.
352915_17_ITEM7_P134_S5	In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of $39 million during 2016, $36 million during 2015 and $49 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P134_S6	We expect reimbursements to our hospitals, pursuant to the 2017 fiscal year programs for Texas and South Carolina, to be at amounts similar to each state s 2016 fiscal year amounts.
352915_17_ITEM7_P135_S0	The ACA and subsequent federal legislation provides for a significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2018 (see below in Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid Revisions for additional disclosure).
352915_17_ITEM7_P136_S0	The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology.
352915_17_ITEM7_P136_S1	As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in Texas and South Carolina, will likely be reduced in the coming years.
352915_17_ITEM7_P136_S2	We are unable to estimate the impact of this federally required reduction at this time.
352915_17_ITEM7_P137_S0	In Nevada, CMS approved a state plan amendment ( SPA ) in August, 2014 that implemented a hospital supplemental payment program retroactive to January 1, 2014 and which was subsequently approved through September 30, 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7_P137_S1	In July, 2016, CMS approved the program for the period of July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017.
352915_17_ITEM7_P138_S0	In connection with this program, our financial results included revenues of approximately $14 million in 2016, $10 million in 2015 and $12 million in 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P138_S1	Assuming the program is approved for the state s 2018 fiscal year, we estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.
352915_17_ITEM7_P139_S0	Risk Factors Related To State Supplemental Medicaid Payments:
352915_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	As outlined above, we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P140_S1	The states include, but are not limited to, Texas, Mississippi, Illinois, Oklahoma, Nevada, Arkansas, California and Indiana.
352915_17_ITEM7_P140_S2	Failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental Medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	In April, 2016, CMS published its final Medicaid Managed Care Rule which explicitly permits but phases out the use of pass-through payments (including supplemental payments) by Medicaid Managed Care Organizations ( MCO ) to hospitals over ten years but allows for a transition of the pass-through payments into value-based payment structures, delivery system reform initiatives or payments tied to services under a MCO contract.
352915_17_ITEM7_P141_S1	Since we are unable to determine the financial impact of this aspect of the final rule, we can provide no assurance that the final rule will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	HITECH Act: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P142_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria.
352915_17_ITEM7_P143_S1	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P143_S2	State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate.
352915_17_ITEM7_P143_S3	Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria.
352915_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	The government s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.
352915_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	Pursuant to HITECH Act regulations, hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_17_ITEM7_P145_S1	We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P145_S2	However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.
352915_17_ITEM7_P145_S3	Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM7_P145_S4	In connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals, our consolidated results of operations include net pre-tax charges of $28 million during 2016, $18 million during 2015 and $8 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P145_S5	These net pre-tax charges consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense related to the costs incurred for the purchase and development of the application, net of EHR incentive income (as reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Income) and the portion of the net expense that was attributable to noncontrolling interests.
352915_17_ITEM7_P146_S0	Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_17_ITEM7_P146_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_17_ITEM7_P147_S0	A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P147_S1	In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow.
352915_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate.
352915_17_ITEM7_P148_S1	Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.
352915_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance.
352915_17_ITEM7_P149_S1	Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy.
352915_17_ITEM7_P149_S2	Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.
352915_17_ITEM7_P149_S3	Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services.
352915_17_ITEM7_P149_S4	To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage.
352915_17_ITEM7_P150_S1	Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy.
352915_17_ITEM7_P150_S2	Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.
352915_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	Health Care Reform: Listed below are the Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are have been, or are scheduled to be, implemented as a result of the ACA.
352915_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	Large employer insurance reforms, effective in 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies, effective in 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms, effective in 2010 and forward.
352915_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	The ACA seeks to increase competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state insurance exchanges.
352915_17_ITEM7_P155_S1	The ACA also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health status, gender, or other specified factors.
352915_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	services provided to insured patients, or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward.
352915_17_ITEM7_P157_S0	Value-Based Purchasing: There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services.
352915_17_ITEM7_P157_S1	These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates.
352915_17_ITEM7_P158_S1	In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events.
352915_17_ITEM7_P158_S2	Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.
352915_17_ITEM7_P159_S0	The ACA contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing.
352915_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	The ACA prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions ( HAC ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P160_S1	Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments.
352915_17_ITEM7_P160_S2	Additionally, hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.
352915_17_ITEM7_P160_S3	The ACA also required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012.
352915_17_ITEM7_P160_S4	The ACA requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in FFY 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years.
352915_17_ITEM7_P160_S5	HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS.
352915_17_ITEM7_P160_S6	HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions.
352915_17_ITEM7_P160_S7	In its fiscal year 2016 IPPS final rule, CMS will fund the value-based purchasing program by reducing base operating DRG payment amounts to participating hospitals by 1.75%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P160_S8	For FFY 2017, this reduction will increase to 2%.
352915_17_ITEM7_P161_S0	In the ACA, Congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program ( HRRP ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P161_S1	The HRRP currently assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates for heart failure, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), excluding planned readmissions, when compared to expected rates.
352915_17_ITEM7_P161_S2	In the fiscal year 2015 IPPS final rule, CMS added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017.
352915_17_ITEM7_P162_S0	The impact of HRRP for federal fiscal year 2016 will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	The ACA requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations ( ACOs ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P163_S1	The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services.
352915_17_ITEM7_P163_S2	The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency.
352915_17_ITEM7_P163_S3	ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.
352915_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P164_S1	The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions.
352915_17_ITEM7_P164_S2	We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments.
352915_17_ITEM7_P164_S3	Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.
352915_17_ITEM7_P165_S0	Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_17_ITEM7_P165_S1	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results.
352915_17_ITEM7_P166_S0	Interest Expense Below is a schedule of our interest expense during 2016, 2015 and 2014 (amounts in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM7_P167_S0	In June, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended, to increase the size of the Term Loan A facility by $200 million.
352915_17_ITEM7_P167_S1	Interest rates were not impacted by this amendment.
352915_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	The credit agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to expire in August, 2019, consists of: (i) an $800 million revolving credit facility ($455 million of outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2016), and; (ii) a Term Loan A facility with $1.864 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7_P168_S1	Our formerly outstanding term loan facility A/original and A2 facilities were previously combined into the Term Loan A facility.
352915_17_ITEM7_P168_S2	The Term Loan B1 facility was repaid in August, 2014, utilizing other borrowed funds.
352915_17_ITEM7_P169_S0	The $400 million, 7.125% Senior Notes matured and were repaid in June, 2016 utilizing a portion of the funds generated from the debt issuances described in (a.), (d.) and (e.).
352915_17_ITEM7_P170_S0	In July, 2014, we redeemed the entire $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Senior Notes due in 2018.
352915_17_ITEM7_P170_S1	An $11 million make-whole premium was paid in connection with this early extinguishment.
352915_17_ITEM7_P171_S0	In December, 2015, we amended our existing accounts receivable securitization program, which was scheduled to expire in October, 2016, to extend the term through December 21, 2018 and increase the borrowing limit to $400 million from $360 million.
352915_17_ITEM7_P172_S0	Interest expense increased $12 million during 2016 to $125 million as compared to $113 million during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P172_S1	The increase was due primarily to: (i) a $15 million increase in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facility and accounts receivable securitization program due to an increase in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings ($3.5 billion in 2016 as compared to $3.1 billion in 2015), as well as an increase in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities (3.0% in 2016 as compared to 2.9% in 2015); (ii) a $2 million decrease in interest rate swap expense, resulting primarily from the 2015 maturities of previously outstanding interest rate swaps, and; (iii) other combined net decrease of $1 million.
352915_17_ITEM7_P172_S2	Interest expense decreased $20 million during 2015 to $113 million as compared to $134 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P173_S0	facilities and accounts receivable securitization program due primarily to a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings ($3.1 billion in 2015 as compared to $3.2 billion in 2014) , as discussed below; (ii) a $9 million decrease in interest rate swap expense, resulting primarily from the 2015 maturities of our previously outstanding interest rate swaps, and; (iii) an $8 million decrease in amortization and financing fees, resulting primarily from the write-off of certain deferred financing costs and original issue discounts in connection with various financing transactions that occurred during the third quarter of 2014, as discussed above.
352915_17_ITEM7_P173_S1	The aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program were approximately $3.5 billion during 2016, $3.1 billion during 2015 and $3.2 billion during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P173_S2	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 3.0% during 2016 and 2.9% during each of 2015 and 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P173_S3	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 3.4% during each of 2016 and 2015 and 3.9% during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P173_S4	In connection with various financing transactions completed during 2014, as discussed below in Capital Resources-Credit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities, our 2014 results of operations include a $36 million pre-tax charge incurred for the costs related to the extinguishment of debt.
352915_17_ITEM7_P173_S5	This charge consisted of the write-off of deferred charges ($20 million) and original issue discount on the extinguished debt ($5 million) as well as the make-whole premium paid ($11 million) on the early redemption of the $250 million, 7.00% senior unsecured notes.
352915_17_ITEM7_P174_S0	Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM7_P175_S0	In May, 2016, we purchased third-party minority ownership interests in six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada.
352915_17_ITEM7_P175_S1	Prior to that date, outside owners held various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in eight of our acute care facilities and one behavioral health care facility.
352915_17_ITEM7_P175_S2	Each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies ( LLC ) or limited partnerships ( LP ).
352915_17_ITEM7_P175_S3	As a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit.
352915_17_ITEM7_P175_S4	When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members /partners share of the income generated by the joint-venture entities.
352915_17_ITEM7_P176_S0	In addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners.
352915_17_ITEM7_P176_S1	The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM7_P177_S0	The impact of discrete tax items did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes during 2016, 2015 or 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P178_S0	applicable to the income generated during 2015 at the behavioral health care facilities located in the U.K. that were acquired since the third quarter of 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P178_S1	We consider the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
352915_17_ITEM7_P178_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $54 million and $49 million, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM7_P179_S0	Effects of Inflation and Seasonality Seasonality Our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_17_ITEM7_P179_S1	This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.
352915_17_ITEM7_P180_S0	Inflation Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years.
352915_17_ITEM7_P180_S1	However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases.
352915_17_ITEM7_P180_S2	Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices.
352915_17_ITEM7_P180_S3	We believe, however, that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.
352915_17_ITEM7_P181_S0	Liquidity Year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015:
352915_17_ITEM7_P181_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.289 billion during 2016 as compared to $1.021 billion during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P181_S2	The net increase of $268 million was primarily attributable to the following:
352915_17_ITEM7_P182_S0	$4 million of other combined net favorable changes.
352915_17_ITEM7_P183_S0	Days sales outstanding ( DSO ): Our DSO are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the year.
352915_17_ITEM7_P183_S1	The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance the end of the year.
352915_17_ITEM7_P183_S2	Our DSO were 53 days at each of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and 57 days at December 31, 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P183_S3	Our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include amounts due from Illinois of approximately $38 million and $28 million, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM7_P183_S4	Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures.
352915_17_ITEM7_P183_S5	Approximately $25 million as of December 31, 2016 and $12 million as of December 31, 2015, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date.
352915_17_ITEM7_P183_S6	Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_17_ITEM7_P183_S7	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois.
352915_17_ITEM7_P183_S8	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due to us from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
352915_17_ITEM7_P184_S0	Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.187 billion during 2016 and $913 million during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P185_S0	The $1.187 billion of net cash used in investing activities during 2016 consisted of $614 million spent related to the acquisition of businesses and property, $520 million spent on capital expenditures, $32 million spent to increase the statutorily required capital reserves of our commercial insurance subsidiary and, $21 million spent on the purchase and implementation of an information technology application.
352915_17_ITEM7_P185_S1	2016 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2016 we spent $614 million to:
352915_17_ITEM7_P186_S0	acquire various other businesses and real property assets.
352915_17_ITEM7_P187_S0	2016 Capital Expenditures: During 2016 we spent $520 million to finance capital expenditures including capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities, including additional capacity added to certain of our behavioral health facilities that have operated near full capacity, and the construction costs related to Henderson Hospital, a newly constructed 130-bed acute care facility located in Henderson, Nevada, that was completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7_P188_S0	2015: The $913 million of net cash used in investing activities during 2015 consisted of $534 million spent related to the acquisition of businesses and property, $379 million spent on capital expenditures, $3 million spent to increase investments of insurance subsidiary and, net of $3 million received from the sale of assets and businesses consisting primarily of divestiture of a small operator of behavioral health care services.
352915_17_ITEM7_P188_S1	2015 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2015 we spent $534 million to:
352915_17_ITEM7_P189_S0	various other businesses, a management contract and real property assets.
352915_17_ITEM7_P190_S0	2015 Capital Expenditures: During 2015 we spent $379 million to finance capital expenditures including capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities, including additional capacity added to certain of our behavioral health facilities that have operated near full capacity, and the construction costs related to Henderson Hospital which was completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7_P190_S1	Net cash used in financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was $126 million during 2016 and $77 million during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7_P191_S0	2016: The $126 million of net cash used in financing activities during 2016 consisted of the following:
352915_17_ITEM7_P192_S0	spent $12 million in financing costs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P193_S0	2015: The $77 million of net cash used in financing activities during 2015 consisted of the following:
352915_17_ITEM7_P194_S0	spent $1 million in financing costs.
352915_17_ITEM7_P195_S0	Year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014:
352915_17_ITEM7_P195_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.021 billion during 2015 as compared to $1.036 billion during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P195_S2	The net decrease of $15 million was primarily attributable to the following:
352915_17_ITEM7_P196_S0	$8 million of other combined net favorable changes.
352915_17_ITEM7_P197_S0	Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $913 million during 2015 and $833 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM7_P197_S1	The factors contributing to the $913 million of net cash used in investing activities during 2015 are detailed above.
352915_17_ITEM7_P197_S2	2014: The $833 million of net cash used in investing activities during 2014 consisted of $431 million spent related to the acquisition of businesses and property, $391 million spent on capital expenditures, $13 million spent in connection with the purchase and implementation of an EHR application at our acute care facilities, $12 million spent to increase investments of insurance subsidiary, net of $15 million received from the sale of assets and businesses.

352915_17_ITEM7_P204_S10	The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans.

352915_17_ITEM7_P209_S3	We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our $800 million revolving credit facility and $400 million accounts receivable securitization program, as well as access to the capital markets, provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.
352915_17_ITEM7_P209_S4	However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_17_ITEM7_P209_S5	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

352915_17_ITEM7_P210_S2	In addition, we lease three hospital facilities from Universal Health Realty Trust (the Trust ) with terms expiring in 2021.

352915_17_ITEM7_P214_S0	In addition, we had various other projects under construction as of December 31, 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7_P214_S1	Because we can terminate substantially all of the construction contracts related to the various other projects at any time without paying a termination fee, these costs are excluded from the table above.

352915_17_ITEM7_P219_S1	We exclude the $207 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments.
352915_17_ITEM7_P219_S2	Please see Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2016 and 2015 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Seven interest rate swaps on a total notional amount of $825 million matured in May, 2015.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Four of these swaps, with a total notional amount of $600 million, became effective in December, 2011 and provided that we receive three-month LIBOR while the average fixed rate payable was 2.38%.

352915_17_ITEM7A_P8_S7	The fixed rate payable on this swap is 1.21%.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based on quotes from our counterparties.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P9_S2	We consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	At December 31, 2016, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was de minimis on a net basis comprised of a $4 million asset which is included in other assets offset by a $4 million liability which in included in other current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P10_S1	At December 31, 2015, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a net liability of $1 million comprised of a $5 million asset which is included in other assets offset by a $6 million liability which is included in other current liabilities.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2016.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P11_S1	For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.
352915_17_ITEM7A_P12_S0	As calculated based upon our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2016 that is subject to interest rate fluctuations, each 1% change in interest rates would impact our pre-tax income by approximately $17 million.
352915_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, together with the reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, are included elsewhere herein.

352915_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
352915_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the SEC rules thereunder.
352915_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the fourth quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
352915_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over our financial reporting.
352915_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria on Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

352915_17_ITEM15_P13_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P13_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_17_ITEM15_P13_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, financial statement schedule, and for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Item 9A as Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting .
352915_17_ITEM15_P13_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
352915_17_ITEM15_P13_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
352915_17_ITEM15_P13_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
352915_17_ITEM15_P13_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
352915_17_ITEM15_P13_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
352915_17_ITEM15_P13_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
352915_17_ITEM15_P13_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
352915_17_ITEM15_P14_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_17_ITEM15_P14_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P14_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P14_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
352915_17_ITEM15_P15_S0	As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting , management has excluded the acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 because the facilities were acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination in late December, 2016.
352915_17_ITEM15_P15_S1	We have also excluded the acquisition of the Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.
352915_17_ITEM15_P15_S2	The acquisition of the Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division had no impact on the consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and represented 0.4% of the consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2016.

352915_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	The more significant accounting policies follow: A) Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner.
352915_17_ITEM15_P22_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
352915_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_17_ITEM15_P23_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 32% of our net patient revenues during 2016, 34% during 2015 and 38% during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P23_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 56% of our net patient revenues during 2016, 54% during 2015 and 52% during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P23_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_17_ITEM15_P23_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_17_ITEM15_P23_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_17_ITEM15_P23_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P23_S7	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_17_ITEM15_P23_S8	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_17_ITEM15_P24_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P24_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_17_ITEM15_P24_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P24_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_17_ITEM15_P24_S4	The vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom are derived from government based payors.
352915_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs, and the government based payor programs in the United Kingdom, are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_17_ITEM15_P25_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future government based reimbursements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P25_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_17_ITEM15_P26_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	C) Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_17_ITEM15_P27_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_17_ITEM15_P27_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_17_ITEM15_P27_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_17_ITEM15_P27_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_17_ITEM15_P27_S6	Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_17_ITEM15_P27_S7	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_17_ITEM15_P27_S8	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_17_ITEM15_P30_S1	Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_17_ITEM15_P31_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_17_ITEM15_P31_S2	A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states.
352915_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration.
352915_17_ITEM15_P32_S1	At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned.
352915_17_ITEM15_P32_S2	There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered.
352915_17_ITEM15_P32_S3	Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible.
352915_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient s Medicaid eligibility.
352915_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	When the patient s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending.
352915_17_ITEM15_P33_S2	Although the patient s ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2016, 2015 or 2014 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
352915_17_ITEM15_P33_S3	We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in uninsured discounts amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_17_ITEM15_P33_S4	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable.
352915_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_17_ITEM15_P34_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience.
352915_17_ITEM15_P35_S1	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $410 million and $399 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	Uncompensated care (charity care and uninsured discounts):
352915_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
352915_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	The provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals was approximately $628 million during 2016, $631 million during 2015 and $590 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_17_ITEM15_P39_S1	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P39_S2	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	Our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include amounts due from Illinois of approximately $38 million and $28 million, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM15_P40_S1	Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures.
352915_17_ITEM15_P40_S2	Approximately $25 million as of December 31, 2016 and $12 million as of December 31, 2015, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date.
352915_17_ITEM15_P40_S3	Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P40_S4	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois.
352915_17_ITEM15_P40_S5	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due to us from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
352915_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	D) Concentration of Revenues: Our six acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined basis, 14% in 2016, 13% in 2015 and 14% in 2014 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	E) Accounting for Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
352915_17_ITEM15_P42_S1	The regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and established the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_17_ITEM15_P42_S2	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and ended as late as 2016 for Medicare and can end as late as 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM15_P42_S3	We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
352915_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	Medicare EHR incentive payments: Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P43_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31st, we have recognized Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria.
352915_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	Medicaid EHR incentive payments: Medicaid EHR incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria.
352915_17_ITEM15_P44_S1	Therefore, the majority of the Medicaid EHR incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria.
352915_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
352915_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	G) Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost.
352915_17_ITEM15_P46_S1	Expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts.
352915_17_ITEM15_P46_S2	Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred.
352915_17_ITEM15_P46_S3	We remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	Construction-in-progress includes both construction projects and equipment not yet placed into service.
352915_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	While in progress, w e capitalized interest on major construction projects and the development and implementation of information technology applications amounting to $1.9 million during 2016 and $304,000 during 2015.
352915_17_ITEM15_P48_S1	There was no interest capitalized during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years).
352915_17_ITEM15_P49_S1	Depreciation expense was $350.8 million during 2016, $337.5 million during 2015 and $314.5 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	H) Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_17_ITEM15_P50_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_17_ITEM15_P50_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_17_ITEM15_P50_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	Goodwill: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_17_ITEM15_P51_S2	We have designated October 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed impairment assessments as of October 1, 2016 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_17_ITEM15_P51_S3	There were also no impairments during 2015 or 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P51_S4	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment reviews, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_17_ITEM15_P51_S5	Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2016 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	The decrease in the Behavioral Health Services goodwill consists primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments.
352915_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	J) Other Assets: Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division, Foundations Recovery Network, LLC during 2015, Ascend Health Corporation during 2012 and Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. during 2010; (ii) prepaid fees for various software and other applications used by our hospitals; (iii) costs incurred in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities; (iv) statutorily required capital reserves related to our commercial insurance subsidiary ($100 million as of December 31, 2016); (v) deposits; (vi) investments in various businesses, including Universal Health Realty Income Trust ($8 million as of December 31, 2016) and Premier, Inc. ($23 million as of December 31, 2016); (vii) the invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related payable included in other noncurrent liabilities; (viii) the estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and; (ix) other miscellaneous assets.
352915_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	As of December 31, 2016, net intangible assets were $228 million and consisted of the following: tradename ($124 million), Medicare licenses ($57 million), certificates of need ($12 million), and contract relationships and other ($35 million, which is net of $34 million of accumulated amortization).
352915_17_ITEM15_P53_S2	As of December 31, 2015, net intangible assets were $219 million and consisted of the following: tradename ($124 million), Medicare licenses ($57 million), certificates of need ($12 million), and contract relationships and other ($25 million, which is net of $25 million of accumulated amortization).
352915_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	K) Physician Guarantees and Commitments: As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our accrued liabilities-other, and our other assets included $2 million and $1 million, respectively, of estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments.
352915_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	The $2 million of potential future financial obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2016 are potential 2017 obligations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	L) Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_17_ITEM15_P55_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_17_ITEM15_P55_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_17_ITEM15_P55_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_17_ITEM15_P55_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_17_ITEM15_P55_S5	See Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for discussion of adjustments to our prior year reserves for claims related to our self-insured general and professional liability and workers compensation liability.
352915_17_ITEM15_P55_S6	In addition, we also: (i) own commercial health insurers headquartered in Nevada and Puerto Rico, and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_17_ITEM15_P55_S7	The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_17_ITEM15_P55_S8	Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	M) Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P56_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_17_ITEM15_P57_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_17_ITEM15_P58_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_17_ITEM15_P58_S2	See Note 6 - Income Taxes, for additional disclosure.
352915_17_ITEM15_P58_S3	Other Noncurrent Liabilities: Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general liability, workers compensation reserves, pension and deferred compensation liabilities, and liabilities incurred in connection with split-dollar life insurance agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife.
352915_17_ITEM15_P58_S4	Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest: As of December 31, 2016, outside owners held noncontrolling, minority ownership interests of: (i) 20% in an acute care facility located in Washington, D.C.; (ii) approximately 11% in an acute care facility located in Texas; (iii) 20% and 30% in two behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania and Ohio, respectively, and; (iv) approximately 5% in an acute care facility located in Nevada.
352915_17_ITEM15_P58_S5	The noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances of $64 million and $9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016, consist primarily of the third-party ownership interests in these hospitals.
352915_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	In May, 2016, we purchased the minority ownership interests held by a third-party in our six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada, for an aggregate cash payment of $445 million which included both the purchase price ($418 million) and the return of reserve capital ($27 million).
352915_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	The ownership interests purchased, which ranged from 26.1% to 27.5%, were previously reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.
352915_17_ITEM15_P59_S2	In connection with this transaction, the aggregate excess purchase price over the book value of the minority ownership interests acquired, net of income taxes, amounted to approximately $133 million which was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
352915_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	In connection with the two behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania and Ohio, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have put options to put their entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	The accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) component of stockholders equity includes: net unrealized gains and losses on effective cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and the net minimum pension liability of a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan which covers employees at one of our subsidiaries.
352915_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	See Note 10 - Pension Plan for additional disclosure regarding the defined benefit pension plan.
352915_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	The amounts recognized in AOCI for the two years ended December 31, 2016 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	Q) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities and Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts: We manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_17_ITEM15_P63_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_17_ITEM15_P64_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_17_ITEM15_P64_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_17_ITEM15_P64_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within stockholders equity.
352915_17_ITEM15_P64_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_17_ITEM15_P65_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_17_ITEM15_P65_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_17_ITEM15_P65_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_17_ITEM15_P65_S3	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
352915_17_ITEM15_P65_S4	Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.
352915_17_ITEM15_P65_S5	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	We use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates.
352915_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	The effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income and remains there until either the sale or liquidation of the subsidiary.
352915_17_ITEM15_P66_S2	The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
352915_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	R) Stock-Based Compensation: At December 31, 2016, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans.
352915_17_ITEM15_P67_S1	Pursuant to the FASB s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
352915_17_ITEM15_P67_S2	The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge.
352915_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	applicable FASB guidance for 2016 permits that cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows.
352915_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
352915_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.
352915_17_ITEM15_P70_S2	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated:
352915_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Net effect of dilutive stock options and grants based on the treasury stock method , for all years presented above, excludes certain outstanding stock options applicable to each year since the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
352915_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	The excluded weighted-average stock options totaled approximately 2.2 million during 2016, 765,000 during 2015 and 2,250 during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	T) Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The fair values of our registered debt and investments are based on quoted market prices.
352915_17_ITEM15_P72_S1	The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar maturities and credit quality.
352915_17_ITEM15_P72_S2	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
352915_17_ITEM15_P72_S3	Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	U) Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
352915_17_ITEM15_P73_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
352915_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	V) Mergers and Acquisitions: The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions.
352915_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
352915_17_ITEM15_P75_S1	Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
352915_17_ITEM15_P75_S2	Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred.
352915_17_ITEM15_P75_S3	The fair value of intangible assets, including Medicare licenses, certificates of need, tradenames and certain contracts, is based on significant judgments made by our management, and accordingly, for significant items we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.
352915_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	During 2013, we entered into a new group purchasing organization agreement ( GPO ) with Premier, Inc. ( Premier), a healthcare performance improvement alliance, and acquired a minority interest in the GPO for a nominal amount.
352915_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2013, in connection with the completion of an initial public offering of the stock of Premier, we received cash proceeds for the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in the GPO, which were recorded as deferred income, on a pro rata basis, as a reduction to our supplies expense over the initial expected life of the GPO agreement.
352915_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	in connection with this GPO agreement, we received shares of restricted stock in Premier which vest ratably over a seven-year period (2014 through 2020), contingent upon our continued participation and minority ownership interest in the GPO.
352915_17_ITEM15_P77_S1	We are recognizing the fair value of this restricted stock, as a reduction to our supplies expense, in our consolidated statements of income, on a pro rata basis, over the vesting period.
352915_17_ITEM15_P77_S2	We have elected to retain of portion of the previously vested shares of Premier, the value of which is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_17_ITEM15_P77_S3	Premier shares held by us after the restrictions have lapsed are adjusted, through accumulated other comprehensive income/loss, to the then current market value as of each respective balance sheet date ($23 million and $13 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively).
352915_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	X) Provider Taxes: We incur health-care related taxes ( Provider Taxes ) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services.
352915_17_ITEM15_P78_S1	Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs.
352915_17_ITEM15_P79_S0	We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments.
352915_17_ITEM15_P79_S1	Under these programs, including the impact of the Texas Uncompensated Care and Upper Payment Limit program, the Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive program, and various other state programs, we earned revenues (before Provider Taxes) of approximately $327 million during 2016, $307 million during 2015 and $295 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P79_S2	These revenues were offset by Provider Taxes of approximately $166 million during 2016, $137 million during 2015, $140 million during 2014, which are recorded in other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income as included herein.
352915_17_ITEM15_P79_S3	The aggregate net benefit from these programs was $161 million during 2016, $170 million during 2015 and $155 million during 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P79_S4	The aggregate net benefit pursuant to these programs is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P79_S5	In addition, under various disproportionate share hospital payment programs and the Nevada state plan amendment program, we earned revenues of $53 million in 2016, $46 million in 2015 and $61 million in 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P80_S0	Y) Recent Accounting Standards: In November, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which eliminates the guidance in Topic 740, Income Taxes, that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet.
352915_17_ITEM15_P80_S1	The amendments require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group, as well as any related valuation allowance, be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet.
352915_17_ITEM15_P80_S2	The amendments are effective for public business entities for annual fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
352915_17_ITEM15_P80_S3	We early adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016, on a prospective basis and did not adjust prior periods presented.
352915_17_ITEM15_P80_S4	The adoption of this standard had no impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
352915_17_ITEM15_P81_S0	In August, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which adds or clarifies guidance of the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows with the intent to alleviate diversity in practice for classifying various types of cash flows.
352915_17_ITEM15_P81_S1	This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
352915_17_ITEM15_P81_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our statement of cash flows.
352915_17_ITEM15_P82_S0	In April and August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15, Interest- Imputation of Interest, respectively, to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs.
352915_17_ITEM15_P83_S0	The standard requires debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability.
352915_17_ITEM15_P83_S1	The FASB clarified that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements can be presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the arrangement.
352915_17_ITEM15_P83_S2	The guidance is effective for annual fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
352915_17_ITEM15_P83_S3	We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016, on a retrospective basis and adjusted prior periods presented.
352915_17_ITEM15_P83_S4	In connection with the adoption of this ASU, debt issuance costs of $26 million as of December 31, 2016 and $19 million as of December 31, 2015 were recorded as deductions from the carrying value of our long-term debt liabilities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P83_S5	The adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial position or overall results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P84_S0	In March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which amends the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions to require recognition of the tax effects resulting from the settlement of stock-based awards as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur.
352915_17_ITEM15_P84_S1	In addition, the ASU requires that all tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments, including the excess tax benefits related to the settlement of stock-based awards, be classified as cash flows from operating activities in the statement of cash flows.
352915_17_ITEM15_P84_S2	The ASU also requires that cash paid by directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows.
352915_17_ITEM15_P84_S3	In addition, the ASU also allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest, consistent with current U.S. GAAP, or account for forfeitures when they occur.
352915_17_ITEM15_P84_S4	We have adopted this new standard, which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, as of January 1, 2017.
352915_17_ITEM15_P85_S0	Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is dependent upon the timing of stock option exercises, and the market price of our stock at the time of exercise, we are unable to estimate the impact this adoption will have on our future financial statements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P86_S0	In May 2014 and March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , respectively, which provides guidance for revenue recognition.
352915_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
352915_17_ITEM15_P87_S1	This ASU also requires additional disclosures.
352915_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	The FASB updated the new revenue standard by clarifying the principal versus agent implementation guidance, but does not change the core principle of the new standard.
352915_17_ITEM15_P88_S1	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, in July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of this standard, with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
352915_17_ITEM15_P88_S2	We anticipate the most significant change will be how the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts will be recognized under the new standards.
352915_17_ITEM15_P88_S3	Under the current standards, our estimate for amounts not expected to be collected based upon our historical experience have been included within net revenue.
352915_17_ITEM15_P88_S4	Under the new standards, our estimate for amounts not expected to be collected based on historical experience will continue to be recognized as a reduction to net revenue.
352915_17_ITEM15_P88_S5	However, subsequent changes in estimate of collectability due to a change in the financial status of a payor, for example a bankruptcy, will be recognized as bad debt expense in operating charges.
352915_17_ITEM15_P88_S6	We will continue to evaluate the impact that the adoption of this ASU may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
352915_17_ITEM15_P89_S0	In February, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Update 2016-02 ) , which requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key qualitative and quantitative information about the entity s leasing arrangements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P89_S1	This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.
352915_17_ITEM15_P89_S2	A modified retrospective approach is required.
352915_17_ITEM15_P89_S3	Upon adoption of this new standard, we will recognize significant right of use assets and lease obligation liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as a result of our operating lease obligations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P89_S4	Operating lease expense will still be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the lease within lease and rental expense in the consolidated statements of income.
352915_17_ITEM15_P89_S5	We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
352915_17_ITEM15_P90_S0	In January, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04 ), which removes the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment.
352915_17_ITEM15_P90_S1	A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
352915_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	ASU 2017-04 is effective for us for the annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted, and applied prospectively.
352915_17_ITEM15_P91_S1	We do not expect ASU 2017-04 to have a material impact on our financial statements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P92_S0	In January, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business to clarify the definition of a business in order to allow for the evaluation of whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses.
352915_17_ITEM15_P92_S1	ASU 2017-01 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
352915_17_ITEM15_P92_S2	The future impact of ASU 2017-01 will be dependent upon the nature of future acquisitions or dispositions made by us, if any.
352915_17_ITEM15_P93_S0	From time to time, new accounting guidance is issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that is adopted by the Company as of the effective date or, in some cases where early adoption is permitted, in advance of the effective date.
352915_17_ITEM15_P93_S1	The Company has assessed the recently issued guidance that is not yet effective and, unless otherwise indicated above, believes the new guidance will not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
352915_17_ITEM15_P94_S0	Z) Foreign Currency Translation: Assets and liabilities of our U.K. subsidiaries are denominated in pound sterling and translated into U.S. dollars at: (i) the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and; (ii) average rates of exchange prevailing during the year for revenues and expenses.
352915_17_ITEM15_P94_S1	The currency translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
352915_17_ITEM15_P94_S2	See Note 3 - Financial Instruments , Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts for additional disclosure.
352915_17_ITEM15_P95_S0	Year ended December 31, 2016: 2016 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses:
352915_17_ITEM15_P96_S0	During 2016 we spent $614 million to:
352915_17_ITEM15_P97_S0	acquire various other businesses and real property assets.
352915_17_ITEM15_P98_S0	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities, which were acquired to enhance and expand our existing operations in the U.S. and the U.K, was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their preliminary estimated fair values as follows:
352915_17_ITEM15_P99_S0	Goodwill of the facilities acquired during each of the last 3 years is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price.
352915_17_ITEM15_P99_S1	The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities: (i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.
352915_17_ITEM15_P99_S2	The vast majority of the goodwill resulting from these transactions is not deductible for federal income tax purposes (see Note 6 - Income Taxes ).
352915_17_ITEM15_P100_S0	On December 28, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division (the Cambian Adult Services ) for a total purchase price of approximately $473 million.
352915_17_ITEM15_P100_S1	The Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) in the U.K. is currently reviewing our acquisition of the Cambian Adult Services.
352915_17_ITEM15_P100_S2	We estimate that the CMA s review of our acquisition will be completed during the second quarter of 2017.
352915_17_ITEM15_P100_S3	However, until such review is completed, we are not permitted to integrate the Cambian Adult Services business into our existing businesses located in the U.K. Further, we can provide no assurance that the CMA will not require us to divest certain parts of the Cambian Adult Services division or certain parts of our existing business located in the U.K. Accordingly, the preliminary purchase price allocations reflected above, related primarily to working capital accounts, property and equipment and residual goodwill, are subject to revision as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.
352915_17_ITEM15_P100_S4	The allocations of purchase price will be finalized once all the information is obtained, but not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.
352915_17_ITEM15_P100_S5	Our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was not impacted by our acquisition of the Cambian Adult Services business since the acquisition occurred in late December, 2016.
352915_17_ITEM15_P100_S6	Our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 included approximately $12 million of net revenues generated at the above-mentioned Desert View Hospital representing the facility s net revenues from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2016.
352915_17_ITEM15_P100_S7	The earnings generated by the hospital since its date of acquisition was not material to our 2016 consolidated net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_17_ITEM15_P100_S8	Assuming the acquisition of the Cambian Adult Services business and Desert View Hospital occurred on January 1, 2016, our 2016 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $9.98 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $730 million, or $7.25 per diluted share.
352915_17_ITEM15_P100_S9	Assuming the above-mentioned acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2015, our 2015 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $9.28 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $708 million and $7.03 per diluted share.
352915_17_ITEM15_P101_S0	2016 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: There were no divestitures during 2016.
352915_17_ITEM15_P102_S0	Year ended December 31, 2015: 2015 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2015 we spent $534 million to:
352915_17_ITEM15_P103_S0	various other businesses, a management contract and real property assets.
352915_17_ITEM15_P104_S0	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their preliminary estimated fair values as follows:
352915_17_ITEM15_P105_S0	Other assets includes an indefinite lived tradename for $124 million recorded in connection with the Foundations acquisition.
352915_17_ITEM15_P105_S1	Included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 was an aggregate of approximately $30 million representing the net revenues generated at the newly acquired facilities from their respective dates of acquisition through December 31, 2015.
352915_17_ITEM15_P105_S2	The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the dates of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, was not material to our 2015 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_17_ITEM15_P105_S3	Assuming the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2015, our 2015 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $9.17 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $690 million, or $6.85 per diluted share.
352915_17_ITEM15_P105_S4	Assuming the above-mentioned acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2014, our 2014 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $8.35 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $545 million and $5.42 per diluted share.
352915_17_ITEM15_P106_S0	2015 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: During 2015 we received $3 million in connection with the divestiture of a small operator of behavioral health care services.
352915_17_ITEM15_P106_S1	Year ended December 31, 2014: 2014 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2014 we spent $431 million to:
352915_17_ITEM15_P107_S0	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their preliminary estimated fair values as follows:
352915_17_ITEM15_P108_S0	Included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 was an aggregate of approximately $175 million representing the net revenues generated at the Cygnet facilities, the commercial health insurer located in Reno, Nevada and the 124-bed behavioral health care facility and outpatient treatment center located in Washington, D.C., from their respective dates of acquisition through December 31, 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P108_S1	The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the dates of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, was not material to our 2014 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_17_ITEM15_P108_S2	Assuming the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2014, our 2014 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $8.28 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $558 million, or $5.55 per diluted share.
352915_17_ITEM15_P109_S0	2014 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: During 2014 we received $15 million in connection with the divestiture of a non-operating investment (during the first quarter) and the real property of a closed behavioral health facility (during the second quarter).
352915_17_ITEM15_P110_S0	3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges: During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had no fair value hedges outstanding.
352915_17_ITEM15_P111_S0	Cash Flow Hedges: We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_17_ITEM15_P111_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_17_ITEM15_P112_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_17_ITEM15_P112_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_17_ITEM15_P112_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_17_ITEM15_P113_S0	other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_17_ITEM15_P113_S1	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_17_ITEM15_P114_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_17_ITEM15_P114_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_17_ITEM15_P114_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_17_ITEM15_P114_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_17_ITEM15_P115_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_17_ITEM15_P116_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_17_ITEM15_P116_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2016 and 2015 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_17_ITEM15_P116_S2	We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_17_ITEM15_P117_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_17_ITEM15_P117_S1	We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties.
352915_17_ITEM15_P117_S2	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

352915_17_ITEM15_P151_S0	Assumes a weighted average forfeiture rate of 9.75%.
352915_17_ITEM15_P152_S0	In addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, we have the following stock incentive and purchase plans: (i) the 2010 Employees Restricted Stock Purchase Plan, as amended in 2015, ( 2010 Plan ) which allows eligible participants to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at par value, subject to certain restrictions, and; (ii) a 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at a ten percent discount.
352915_17_ITEM15_P153_S0	There were 14,146, 17,789 and 26,189 shares of restricted stock granted pursuant to the 2010 Plan during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with various ratable vesting periods ranging up to five years from the date of grant.
352915_17_ITEM15_P153_S1	There were 75,792, 68,213 and 75,303 and shares issued pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM15_P153_S2	We have reserved 2.8 million shares of Class B Common Stock for issuance under these various plans (excluding terminated plans and including a reserve reduction during 2015) and have issued approximately 1.4 million shares, net of cancellations, pursuant to the terms of these plans (excluding terminated plans) as of December 31, 2016.
352915_17_ITEM15_P153_S3	As of December 31, 2016, approximately 1.4 million shares of Class B Common Stock remain available for issuance pursuant to these various plans.
352915_17_ITEM15_P153_S4	At December 31, 2016, 21,805,773 shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans.
352915_17_ITEM15_P153_S5	Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.
352915_17_ITEM15_P154_S0	6) INCOME TAXES Components of income tax expense/(benefit) are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM15_P155_S0	The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $58 million in 2016, $41 million in 2015 and $15 million in 2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P155_S1	Our consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on undistributed earnings that we do not intend to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.
352915_17_ITEM15_P155_S2	Certain of our undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. have a statutory rate of 20.0%.
352915_17_ITEM15_P155_S3	As of December 31, 2016, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $99 million of such earnings.
352915_17_ITEM15_P155_S4	The amount of unrecognizable deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be approximately $15 million.
352915_17_ITEM15_P156_S0	A reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows:
352915_17_ITEM15_P157_S0	Our effective tax rates were 35.4%, 34.5% and 34.9% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM15_P157_S1	The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily impacted by the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests due to our purchase of the minority ownership interests held by a third-party in our six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is not tax effected in the statement of income.
352915_17_ITEM15_P157_S2	Including the expense related to income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 36.8%, 36.7% and 37.3%, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM15_P158_S0	Included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are prepaid federal and state income taxes amounting to approximately $10 million and $42 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM15_P159_S0	Deferred income taxes are based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities under the provisions of the enacted tax laws.
352915_17_ITEM15_P159_S1	The components of deferred taxes are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM15_P160_S0	Decreases in deferred tax liabilities relating to depreciable and amortizable assets primarily reflect the impact of deferred taxes recorded in conjunction with our purchase of the minority ownership interests held by a third-party in our six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada.
352915_17_ITEM15_P161_S0	At December 31, 2016, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2017 through 2036), and credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $1.04 billion representing approximately $52 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit).
352915_17_ITEM15_P161_S1	At December 31, 2016, there were foreign net operating losses and credit carryforwards of approximately $21 million expiring through 2023 representing approximately $5 million in deferred foreign tax benefit.
352915_17_ITEM15_P161_S2	Increases in deferred tax assets relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards reflect the impact of deferred taxes recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Cambian Adult Services located in the U.K. during 2016.
352915_17_ITEM15_P161_S3	At December 31, 2016, related to the acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network, LLC, there were federal net operating losses of approximately $7 million expiring through 2032 representing approximately $2 million in deferred federal tax benefits.
352915_17_ITEM15_P162_S0	A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
352915_17_ITEM15_P162_S1	Based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized.
352915_17_ITEM15_P162_S2	Therefore, valuation allowances of approximately $52 million and $51 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM15_P162_S3	During 2016, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by $1 million due to additional net operating losses incurred.
352915_17_ITEM15_P162_S4	In addition, valuation allowances of approximately $4 million and $2 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 related to foreign net operating losses and credit carryforwards.
352915_17_ITEM15_P162_S5	The foreign valuation allowance increased approximately $3 million due to the acquisition of Cambian Adult Services.
352915_17_ITEM15_P162_S6	There were no significant increases in valuation allowances as a result of the acquisition of Foundations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P163_S0	We adopted the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007.
352915_17_ITEM15_P163_S1	During 2016 and 2015, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased less than $1 million due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years.
352915_17_ITEM15_P163_S2	During 2016, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of less than $1 million.
352915_17_ITEM15_P163_S3	The balance at each of December 31, 2016 and 2015, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately $1 million as of each date.
352915_17_ITEM15_P163_S4	We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.
352915_17_ITEM15_P163_S5	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have accrued interest and penalties of less than $1 million as of each date.
352915_17_ITEM15_P163_S6	The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2013 and subsequent years.
352915_17_ITEM15_P164_S0	Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years.
352915_17_ITEM15_P165_S0	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months, however, it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P166_S0	The tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (amounts in thousands).
352915_17_ITEM15_P167_S0	7) LEASE COMMITMENTS Three of our hospital facilities are held under operating leases with Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms expiring in 2021 (see Note 9 for additional disclosure).
352915_17_ITEM15_P167_S1	We also lease the real property of certain facilities (see Item 2.
352915_17_ITEM15_P167_S2	A summary of property under capital lease follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM15_P168_S0	Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as of December 31, 2016, are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM15_P169_S0	We assumed capital lease obligations of approximately $152,000 in 2016, $7 million in 2015 and $16 million in 2014, in connection with the leases on certain real estate assets.
352915_17_ITEM15_P169_S1	In the ordinary course of business, our facilities routinely lease equipment pursuant to new lease arrangements that will likely result in future lease and rental expense in excess of amounts indicated above.
352915_17_ITEM15_P170_S0	8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Professional and General Liability, Workers Compensation Liability and Property Insurance Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation Liability: Effective November, 2010, the vast majority of our subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million and $3 million per occurrence, respectively.
352915_17_ITEM15_P170_S1	These subsidiaries are provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention (either $3 million or $10 million) or underlying policy limits up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred after 2013 a nd up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred from 2011 through 2013.
352915_17_ITEM15_P170_S2	We remain liable for 10% of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of $10 million up to $60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate.
352915_17_ITEM15_P170_S3	In addition, from time to time based upon marketplace conditions, we may elect to purchase additional commercial coverage for certain of our facilities or businesses.
352915_17_ITEM15_P170_S4	Our behavioral health care facilities located in the U.K. have policies through a commercial insurance carrier located in the U.K. that provides for 10 million of professional liability coverage and 25 million of general liability coverage.
352915_17_ITEM15_P170_S5	The facilities located in the U.K. acquired in late December, 2016 in connection with our acquisition of the Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division have been included in the above-mentioned U.K. insurance program.
352915_17_ITEM15_P171_S0	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_17_ITEM15_P171_S1	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_17_ITEM15_P171_S2	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P171_S3	As of December 31, 2016, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $207 million, of which $48 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P171_S4	As of December 31, 2015, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $204 million, of which $48 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P171_S5	Below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and workers compensation reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2016 (amount in thousands):
352915_17_ITEM15_P172_S0	General and professional liability amount is net of adjustment recorded during 2014, as discussed below.
352915_17_ITEM15_P173_S0	Our consolidated results of operations during 2016 and 2015 were not materially impacted by adjustments to our prior year reserves for professional and general liability claims.
352915_17_ITEM15_P173_S1	During 2014, based upon a reserve analysis of our estimated future claims payments, we recorded a reduction to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) amounting to $20 million.
352915_17_ITEM15_P174_S0	As of December 31, 2016, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $67 million, of which $33 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P174_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $68 million, of which $34 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P174_S2	Our consolidated results of operations during 2016, 2015 or 2014 were not materially impacted by adjustments to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims.
352915_17_ITEM15_P174_S3	Although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for self-insured general and professional and workers compensation claims, given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves, as discussed above, it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves.
352915_17_ITEM15_P175_S0	We have commercial property insurance policies for our properties covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit per occurrence, subject to a deductible ranging from $50,000 to $250,000 per occurrence.
352915_17_ITEM15_P175_S1	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the declared total insurable value of the property.
352915_17_ITEM15_P175_S2	In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_17_ITEM15_P175_S3	Commercially insured earthquake coverage for our facilities is subject to various deductibles and limitations including: (i) $500 million limitation for our facilities located in Nevada; (ii) $130 million limitation for our facilities located in California; (iii) $100 million limitation for our facilities located in fault zones within the United States; (iv) $40 million limitation for our facility located in Puerto Rico, and; (v) $250 million limitation for many of our facilities located in other states.
352915_17_ITEM15_P175_S4	Deductibles for flood losses vary in amount, up to a maximum of $500,000, based upon location of the facility.
352915_17_ITEM15_P175_S5	Since certain of our facilities have been designated by our insurer as flood prone, we have elected to purchase policies from The National Flood Insurance Program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible.
352915_17_ITEM15_P175_S6	Property insurance for our behavioral health facilities located in the U.K. are provided on an all risk basis up to a 1.29 billion limit that includes coverage for real and personal property as well as business interruption losses.
352915_17_ITEM15_P175_S7	Legal Proceedings We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations, regulatory matters and litigation, as outlined below.
352915_17_ITEM15_P176_S0	Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) and Government Investigations: In February, 2013, the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and certain UHS owned behavioral health facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_17_ITEM15_P176_S1	The Meadows Psychiatric Center received a subpoena from the OIG in February, 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_17_ITEM15_P176_S2	Unrelated to these matters, the Keys of Carolina was closed and the real property was sold in January, 2013.
352915_17_ITEM15_P176_S3	We were advised that a qui tam action had been filed against Roxbury Treatment Center but the government declined to intervene and the case was dismissed.
352915_17_ITEM15_P177_S0	In April, 2013, the OIG served facility specific subpoenas on Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting various documents from January, 2005 to the date of the subpoenas.
352915_17_ITEM15_P177_S1	In July, 2013, another subpoena was issued to Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health requesting additional records.
352915_17_ITEM15_P177_S2	In October, 2013, we were advised that the DOJ s Criminal Frauds Section had opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center.
352915_17_ITEM15_P177_S3	Subsequent subpoenas have since been issued to River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center requesting additional documentation.
352915_17_ITEM15_P178_S0	In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal regulations regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P178_S1	The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility.
352915_17_ITEM15_P178_S2	River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension.
352915_17_ITEM15_P178_S3	Notwithstanding, CMS continued the payment suspension.
352915_17_ITEM15_P178_S4	River Point Behavioral Health provided additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect.
352915_17_ITEM15_P178_S5	We cannot predict if and/or when the facility s suspended payments will resume.
352915_17_ITEM15_P178_S6	Although the operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015, the payment suspension has had a material adverse effect on the facility s results of operations and financial condition.
352915_17_ITEM15_P179_S0	In June, 2013, the OIG served a subpoena on Coastal Harbor Health System in Savannah, Georgia requesting documents from January, 2009 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_17_ITEM15_P179_S1	In February, 2014, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include the National Deaf Academy.
352915_17_ITEM15_P180_S0	In March, 2014, a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) was served on the National Deaf Academy requesting documents and information from the facility from January 1, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_17_ITEM15_P180_S1	We have been advised by the government that the National Deaf Academy has been added to the facilities which are the subject of the coordinated investigation referenced above.
352915_17_ITEM15_P181_S0	In March, 2014, CIDs were served on Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Streamwood Behavioral Health requesting documents and information from those facilities from January, 2008 through the date of the CID.
352915_17_ITEM15_P181_S1	In September, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division advised us that they were expanding their investigation to include four additional facilities and were requesting production of documents from these facilities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P181_S2	These facilities are Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons by the Sea, and Turning Point Care Center.
352915_17_ITEM15_P182_S0	In December, 2014, the DOJ Civil Division requested that Salt Lake Behavioral Health produce documents responsive to the original subpoenas issued in February, 2013.
352915_17_ITEM15_P182_S1	In March, 2015, the OIG issued subpoenas to Central Florida Behavioral Hospital and University Behavioral Center requesting certain documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena.
352915_17_ITEM15_P182_S2	In late March, 2015, we were notified that the investigation conducted by the Criminal Frauds Section had been expanded to include UHS as a corporate entity arising out of the coordinated investigation of the facilities described above and, in particular, Hartgrove Hospital.
352915_17_ITEM15_P182_S3	In December, 2015, we were notified by the DOJ Civil Division that the civil investigation also includes Arbour Hospital, Arbour-Fuller Hospital, Pembroke Hospital and Westwood Lodge located in Massachusetts.
352915_17_ITEM15_P182_S4	To date, these facilities have not received any requests for documentation or other information.
352915_17_ITEM15_P183_S0	The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation referenced above is a False Claims Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P183_S1	At present, we are uncertain as to potential liability and/or financial exposure of the Company and/or named facilities, if any, in connection with these matters.
352915_17_ITEM15_P184_S0	In December, 2015, we were advised that the DOJ opened an investigation involving the El Paso Behavioral Health System in El Paso, Texas.
352915_17_ITEM15_P184_S1	The DOJ was investigating potential Stark law violations relating to arrangements between the facility and physician(s) at the facility.
352915_17_ITEM15_P184_S2	These agreements were entered into before we acquired the facility as a part of our acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation in October, 2012.
352915_17_ITEM15_P184_S3	To our knowledge, this matter is not a part of the omnibus investigation referenced above.
352915_17_ITEM15_P184_S4	We have reached a settlement with the DOJ, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, concluding this matter.
352915_17_ITEM15_P185_S0	In January, 2016, we were notified that the Department of Justice opened an investigation of the South Texas Health System of a potential False Claim Act case regarding compensation paid to cardiologists pursuant to employment agreements entered into in 2005.
352915_17_ITEM15_P185_S1	In February, 2017, we were notified that the Department of Justice decided not to intervene in an under seal qui tam case and filed a notice of declination.
352915_17_ITEM15_P185_S2	Further, we have been informed that the relator is dismissing the case.
352915_17_ITEM15_P186_S0	Litigation: U.S. ex rel Escobar v. Universal Health Services, Inc.
352915_17_ITEM15_P187_S0	This is a False Claims Act case filed against Universal Health Services, Inc., UHS of Delaware, Inc. and HRI Clinics, Inc.
352915_17_ITEM15_P187_S1	d/b/a Arbour Counseling Services in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
352915_17_ITEM15_P187_S2	This qui tam action primarily alleges that Arbour Counseling Services failed to appropriately supervise certain clinical providers in contravention of regulatory requirements and the submission of claims to Medicaid were subsequently improper.
352915_17_ITEM15_P187_S3	Relators make other claims of improper billing to Medicaid associated with alleged failures of Arbour Counseling to comply with state regulations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P188_S0	The U.S. Attorney s Office and the Massachusetts Attorney General s Office initially declined to intervene.
352915_17_ITEM15_P188_S1	UHS filed a motion to dismiss and the trial court originally granted the motion dismissing the case.
352915_17_ITEM15_P188_S2	The First Circuit Court of Appeals ( First Circuit ) reversed the trial court s dismissal of the case.
352915_17_ITEM15_P188_S3	The United States Supreme Court subsequently vacated the First Circuit s opinion and remanded the case for further consideration under the new legal standards established by the Supreme Court for False Claims Act cases.
352915_17_ITEM15_P188_S4	During the 4 th quarter of 2016, the First Circuit issued a revised opinion upholding their reversal of the trial court s dismissal.
352915_17_ITEM15_P188_S5	The case was then remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.
352915_17_ITEM15_P188_S6	In January 2017, the U.S. Attorney s Office and Massachusetts Attorney General s Office advised of the potential for intervention in the case.
352915_17_ITEM15_P189_S0	We are defending this case vigorously.
352915_17_ITEM15_P189_S1	At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_17_ITEM15_P190_S0	Heed v. Universal Health Services, Inc., et al.
352915_17_ITEM15_P191_S0	In December 2016 a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against UHS and certain UHS officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws.
352915_17_ITEM15_P191_S1	Plaintiff alleges that defendants violated federal securities laws relating to the disclosures made in public filings associated with practices at our behavioral health facilities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P191_S2	Although we have not been served with the complaint at this time, we deny liability and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.
352915_17_ITEM15_P191_S3	At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_17_ITEM15_P192_S0	Other Matters: In late September, 2015, many hospitals in Pennsylvania, including seven of our behavioral health care hospitals located in the state, received letters from the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (the Department ) demanding repayment of allegedly excess Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments ( DSH ) for the federal fiscal year 2011 ( FFY2011 ) amounting to approximately $4 million in the aggregate.
352915_17_ITEM15_P192_S1	In September, 2016, we received similar requests for repayment for alleged DSH overpayments for FFY2012.
352915_17_ITEM15_P192_S2	We filed administrative appeals for all of our facilities contesting the recoupment efforts for FFYs 2011 and 2012 as we believe the Department s calculation methodology is inaccurate and conflicts with applicable federal and state laws and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P192_S3	The Department has agreed to postpone the recoupment of the state s share of the DSH payments until all hospital appeals are resolved but recently started recoupment of the federal share.
352915_17_ITEM15_P192_S4	If the Department is ultimately successful in its demand related to FFY2011 and FFY2012, it could take similar action with regards to FFY2013 and FFY2014.
352915_17_ITEM15_P193_S0	Due to a change in the Pennsylvania Medicaid State Plan and implementation of a CMS-approved Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver, we do not believe the methodology applied by the Department to FFY2011 and FFY2012 is applicable to reimbursements received for Medicaid services provided after January 1, 2015 by our behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania.
352915_17_ITEM15_P193_S1	We can provide no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our legal and administrative appeals related to the Department s repayment demands.
352915_17_ITEM15_P193_S2	If our legal and administrative appeals are unsuccessful, our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by these repayments.
352915_17_ITEM15_P194_S0	Matters Relating to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ): The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of PSI) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010.
352915_17_ITEM15_P195_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital:
352915_17_ITEM15_P196_S0	In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_17_ITEM15_P196_S1	The requested documents were collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_17_ITEM15_P196_S2	Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July, 2011 requesting additional documents, which have also been delivered to the DOJ.
352915_17_ITEM15_P196_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_17_ITEM15_P196_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_17_ITEM15_P197_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital: In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.

352915_17_ITEM15_P197_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ.
352915_17_ITEM15_P197_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_17_ITEM15_P197_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_17_ITEM15_P197_S5	We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry which subjects us to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P197_S6	These claims or suits include claims for damages for personal injuries, medical malpractice, commercial/contractual disputes, wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians staff privileges, and employment related claims.
352915_17_ITEM15_P197_S7	In addition, health care companies are subject to investigations and/or actions by various state and federal governmental agencies or those bringing claims on their behalf.
352915_17_ITEM15_P197_S8	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations against healthcare providers concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes as well as compliance with clinical and operational regulations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P197_S9	Currently, and from time to time, we and some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries in the form of subpoenas, Civil Investigative Demands, audits and other document requests from various federal and state agencies.
352915_17_ITEM15_P197_S10	These inquiries can lead to notices and/or actions including repayment obligations from state and federal government agencies associated with potential non-compliance with laws and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P197_S11	Further, the federal False Claim Act allows private individuals to bring lawsuits (qui tam actions) against healthcare providers that submit claims for payments to the government.
352915_17_ITEM15_P198_S0	Various states have also adopted similar statutes.
352915_17_ITEM15_P198_S1	When such a claim is filed, the government will investigate the matter and decide if they are going to intervene in the pending case.
352915_17_ITEM15_P199_S0	the False Claims Act s requirements.
352915_17_ITEM15_P199_S1	If the government chooses not to intervene, the private individual(s) can proceed independently on behalf of the government.
352915_17_ITEM15_P200_S0	Health care providers that are found to violate the False Claims Act may be subject to substantial monetary fines/penalties as well as face potential exclusion from participating in government health care programs or be required to comply with Corporate Integrity Agreements as a condition of a settlement of a False Claim Act matter.
352915_17_ITEM15_P201_S0	In September 2014, the Criminal Division of the DOJ, announced that all qui tam cases will be shared with their Division to determine if a parallel criminal investigation should be opened.
352915_17_ITEM15_P201_S1	The DOJ has also announced an intention to pursue civil and criminal actions against individuals within a company as well as the corporate entity or entities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P201_S2	In addition, health care facilities are subject to monitoring by state and federal surveyors to ensure compliance with program Conditions of Participation.
352915_17_ITEM15_P201_S3	In the event a facility is found to be out of compliance with a Condition of Participation and unable to remedy the alleged deficiency(s), the facility faces termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or compliance with a System Improvement Agreement to remedy deficiencies and ensure compliance.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S0	The laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry are complex covering, among other things, government healthcare participation requirements, licensure, certification and accreditation, privacy of patient information, reimbursement for patient services as well as fraud and abuse compliance.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and expanding.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S2	Further, the Affordable Care Act has added additional obligations on healthcare providers to report and refund overpayments by government healthcare programs and authorizes the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S3	We monitor our business and have developed an ethics and compliance program with respect to these complex laws, rules and regulations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S4	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with government regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with the sanctions referenced above which include fines, penalties and/or substantial damages, repayment obligations, payment suspensions, licensure revocation, and expulsion from government healthcare programs.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S5	Even if we were to ultimately prevail in any action brought against us or our facilities or in responding to any inquiry, such action or inquiry could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S6	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S7	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S8	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S9	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S10	In addition, various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending.
352915_17_ITEM15_P202_S11	In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
352915_17_ITEM15_P203_S0	In addition to our long-term debt obligations as discussed in Note 4 - Long-Term Debt and our operating lease obligations as discussed in Note 7 - Lease Commitments , we have various other contractual commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2016 as follows: (i) other combined estimated future purchase obligations of $350 million related to a long-term contract with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing services for our acute care facilities ($101 million), expected future costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the ongoing operation of an electronic health records application and purchase implementation of a revenue cycle application for our acute care facilities ($247 million) and estimated minimum liabilities for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future ($2 million); (ii) estimated construction commitment of $43 million representing our share of the construction costs of two new behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania and Washington that we are required to build pursuant to joint-venture agreements with third-parties; (iii) combined estimated future payments of $213 million related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan ($194 million consisting of estimated payments through 2089) and other retirement plan liabilities ($19 million), and; (iv) accrued and unpaid estimated claims expense incurred in connection with our commercial health insurers and self-insured employee benefit plans ($90 million).

352915_17_ITEM15_P214_S0	The non-contributory plan is a defined benefit pension plan which covers employees of one of our subsidiaries.
352915_17_ITEM15_P214_S1	The benefits are based on years of service and the employee s highest compensation for any five years of employment.
352915_17_ITEM15_P215_S0	Our funding policy is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount that should be funded in accordance with the provisions of ERISA.

352915_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	We also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.
352915_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	We are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities.
352915_18_ITEM1_P15_S3	From time to time applications are filed with state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need, or CONs.
352915_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	We are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S3	In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees, communities and our stockholders.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S4	In addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S5	We believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S6	Generally, we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S7	Other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S8	Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S9	Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S10	We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S11	In addition, our acute care services business is typically subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S12	The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated.
352915_18_ITEM1_P17_S13	Accordingly, information related to hospitals acquired during the five-year period has been included from the respective dates of acquisition, and information related to hospitals divested during the five year period has been included up to the respective dates of divestiture.
352915_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Average Available Beds is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available for patient care.
352915_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	A hospital may have appropriate licenses for more beds than are in service for a number of reasons, including lack of demand, incomplete construction, and anticipation of future needs.
352915_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Patient Days is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient.
352915_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Occupancy Rate is calculated by dividing average patient days (total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period) by the number of average beds, either available or licensed.
352915_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Sources of Revenue We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Sources of Revenue for additional disclosure.
352915_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Reporting.
352915_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self-referrals by physicians).
352915_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected.
352915_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.
352915_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Licensing, Certification and Accreditation: All of our U.S. hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations in the U.S. and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness.
352915_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments.
352915_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.
352915_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our facilities in the United Kingdom are also subject to various laws and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	All of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by The Joint Commission.
352915_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers in the U.S. are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	If any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors.
352915_18_ITEM1_P24_S4	We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards.
352915_18_ITEM1_P24_S5	The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Certificates of Need: Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need ( CON ) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility s license, which could harm our business.
352915_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions.
352915_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Utilization Review: Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services.
352915_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	The law and regulations require Peer Review Organizations ( PROs ) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group ( DRG ) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay.
352915_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	PROs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the PRO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program.
352915_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	We have contracted with PROs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.
352915_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	Audits: Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims.
352915_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights.
352915_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	The federal government contracts with third-party recovery audit contractors ( RACs ) and Medicaid integrity contractors ( MICs ), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers.
352915_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors ( ZPICs ) target claims for potential fraud and abuse.
352915_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	Additionally, Medicare administrative contractors ( MACs ) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers.
352915_18_ITEM1_P32_S3	The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) announced its intent to consolidate many of these Medicare and Medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors ( UPICs ), though it remains unclear what effect, if any, this proposed consolidation may have.
352915_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years, the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial.
352915_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
352915_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation The Stark Law:
352915_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met.
352915_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	These types of referrals are known as self-referrals.
352915_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include civil penalties up to $24,253 for each violation, and up to $161,692 for sham arrangements.
352915_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart.
352915_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities.
352915_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	This regulation also places a number of compliance requirements on physician-owned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest.
352915_18_ITEM1_P37_S3	There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.
352915_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.
352915_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Anti-kickback Statute: A provision of the Social Security Act known as the anti-kickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program.
352915_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	However, changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti-kickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law.
352915_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	The anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors, from the federal anti-kickback statute for various activities.
352915_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services.
352915_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
352915_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws.
352915_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	Civil money penalties may include fines of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	Similar State Laws: Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care.
352915_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure.
352915_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes.
352915_18_ITEM1_P44_S3	However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
352915_18_ITEM1_P44_S4	These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_18_ITEM1_P44_S5	It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_18_ITEM1_P44_S6	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see Item 3.
352915_18_ITEM1_P44_S7	Legal Proceedings), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_18_ITEM1_P44_S8	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_18_ITEM1_P44_S9	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs.
352915_18_ITEM1_P44_S10	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations: A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the False Claims Act s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions.
352915_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.
352915_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	When a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,181 to $22,363 for each separate false claim.
352915_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act.
352915_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government.
352915_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 ( FERA ) has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds.
352915_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	FERA also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments.
352915_18_ITEM1_P49_S3	In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act.
352915_18_ITEM1_P49_S4	Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court.
352915_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Recent changes to the False Claims Act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified, or by the date any corresponding cost report was due, whichever is later.
352915_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil False Claims Act liability.
352915_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions: The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid.
352915_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud.
352915_18_ITEM1_P50_S4	Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.
352915_18_ITEM1_P50_S5	Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs.
352915_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.
352915_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:
352915_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH ), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically.
352915_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry.
352915_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information.
352915_18_ITEM1_P52_S3	The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed.
352915_18_ITEM1_P52_S4	Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.
352915_18_ITEM1_P52_S5	We believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of HIPAA, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance.
352915_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information.
352915_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements.
352915_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	HITECH has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred.
352915_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	We believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date.
352915_18_ITEM1_P53_S4	Recent changes to the HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers, including expanded obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.
352915_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft.
352915_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010, signed on December 18, 2010, appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the Red Flags Rule, but permits the FTC or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the Red Flags Rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft.
352915_18_ITEM1_P54_S2	Compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future.
352915_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005: On July 29, 2005, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 was enacted, which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety.
352915_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	This legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report Patient Safety Work Product ( PSWP ) to Patient Safety Organizations ( PSOs ).
352915_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	Under the system, PSWP is made privileged, confidential and legally protected from disclosure.
352915_18_ITEM1_P55_S3	PSWP does not include medical, discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety.
352915_18_ITEM1_P55_S4	This legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute PSWP.
352915_18_ITEM1_P55_S5	PSOs are certified by the Secretary of the HHS for three-year periods and analyze PSWP, provide feedback to providers and may report non-identifiable PSWP to a database.
352915_18_ITEM1_P55_S6	In addition, PSOs are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies.
352915_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs.
352915_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.
352915_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Corporate Practice of Medicine: Several states, including Florida, Nevada, California and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services.
352915_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties.
352915_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable.
352915_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	These statutes and/or regulations vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.
352915_18_ITEM1_P57_S4	We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians.
352915_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.
352915_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	EMTALA: All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act ( EMTALA ).
352915_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	This federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition.
352915_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment.
352915_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay.
352915_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program.
352915_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.
352915_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	The federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions.
352915_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	CMS has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments.
352915_18_ITEM1_P62_S3	The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future.
352915_18_ITEM1_P62_S4	We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.
352915_18_ITEM1_P62_S5	Health Care Industry Investigations: We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation.
352915_18_ITEM1_P62_S6	Legal Proceedings included herein for additional disclosure.
352915_18_ITEM1_P62_S7	In addition, currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies.
352915_18_ITEM1_P62_S8	Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
352915_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.
352915_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours.
352915_18_ITEM1_P63_S2	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P63_S3	Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.
352915_18_ITEM1_P63_S4	Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P63_S5	It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity.
352915_18_ITEM1_P63_S6	It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.
352915_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them.
352915_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.
352915_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	State Rate Review: Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state.
352915_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform: Medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level.
352915_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	All states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits.
352915_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	Over half of the states have limits on damages awards.
352915_18_ITEM1_P66_S3	Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits, and many states have established limits on attorney fees.
352915_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	Many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform.
352915_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform, and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates.
352915_18_ITEM1_P67_S2	Reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.
352915_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	Compliance Program: Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998.
352915_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	Currently, the program s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program s policies.
352915_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	Since its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry s expectations and our needs.
352915_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business.
352915_18_ITEM1_P69_S2	Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program.
352915_18_ITEM1_P69_S3	Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas.
352915_18_ITEM1_P69_S4	Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.
352915_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	United Kingdom Regulation: Our operations in the United Kingdom are also subject to a high level of regulation relating to registration and licensing requirements, employee regulation, clinical standards, environmental rules as well as other areas.
352915_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	We are also subject to a highly regulated business environment, and failure to comply with the various laws and regulations applicable to us could lead to substantial penalties and other adverse effects on our business.
352915_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our facilities located in the U.S. had approximately 76,600 employees as of December 31, 2017, of whom approximately 55,000 were employed full-time.
352915_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	In addition, our facilities located in the U.K. had approximately 6,500 employees as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	In a number of our markets, physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours.
352915_18_ITEM1_P72_S2	Within our acute care division, approximately 240 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P72_S3	Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time.
352915_18_ITEM1_P72_S4	In addition, within our behavioral health division, approximately 490 psychiatrists are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P72_S5	Each of our hospitals is managed on a day-to-day basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of ours.
352915_18_ITEM1_P72_S6	In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital.
352915_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
352915_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	Approximately 765 of our employees at six of our hospitals are unionized.
352915_18_ITEM1_P74_S1	At Valley Hospital Medical Center, unionized employees belong to the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union and the International Union of Operating Engineers.
352915_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	Engineers at Desert Springs Hospital are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers.
352915_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	At The George Washington University Hospital, dietary and housekeeping employees are represented by the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ).
352915_18_ITEM1_P75_S2	At the Psychiatric Institute of Washington, clinical, clerical, support and maintenance employees are represented by the Communication Workers of America (AFL-CIO).
352915_18_ITEM1_P75_S3	Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, certain technicians and therapists and some clerical employees at HRI Hospital in Boston are represented by the SEIU.
352915_18_ITEM1_P75_S4	At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Teamsters and the Northwestern Nurses Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals.
352915_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	The health care industry is highly competitive.
352915_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment.
352915_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes.
352915_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_18_ITEM1_P77_S3	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us.
352915_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us.
352915_18_ITEM1_P78_S2	In addition, some of our hospitals face competition from hospitals or surgery centers that are physician owned.
352915_18_ITEM1_P78_S3	The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in determining a hospital s success and competitive advantage.
352915_18_ITEM1_P78_S4	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.
352915_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	In addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals.
352915_18_ITEM1_P79_S2	We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_18_ITEM1_P79_S3	Our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries, wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate.
352915_18_ITEM1_P79_S4	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_18_ITEM1_P79_S5	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	Many states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws.
352915_18_ITEM1_P80_S1	The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states.
352915_18_ITEM1_P80_S2	In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.
352915_18_ITEM1_P80_S3	Our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges.
352915_18_ITEM1_P81_S2	In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients.
352915_18_ITEM1_P81_S3	Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience.
352915_18_ITEM1_P81_S4	The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	A key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S1	The competition to acquire hospitals is significant.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S2	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit health care companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S3	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S4	We intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S5	Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust At December 31, 2017, we held approximately 5.7% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the Trust ).
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S6	We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement, which is scheduled to expire on December 31 st of each year, pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S7	In December, 2017, the advisory agreement was renewed by the Trust for 2018 pursuant to the same terms in place during each of the last three years.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S8	During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the advisory fee was computed at 0.70% of the Trust s average invested real estate assets.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S9	In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S10	Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S11	We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $3.6 million during 2017, $3.3 million during 2016 and $2.8 million during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S12	Our pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $2.6 million during 2017, $1.0 million during 2016 and $1.4 million during 2015, and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S13	Included in our share of the Trust s income was approximately $1.7 million in 2017 related to our share of a gain recorded resulting from a property transaction, as well as insurance proceeds in excess of damaged Trust property.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S14	During 2015, our share of the Trust s income included $500,000 related to our share of a gain on an exchange transaction recorded by the Trust.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S15	We received dividends from the Trust amounting to $2.1 million during 2017 and $2.0 million during each of 2016 and 2015.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S16	The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $8.2 million and $7.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
352915_18_ITEM1_P82_S17	The market value of our investment in the Trust was $59.2 million at December 31, 2017 and $51.7 million at December 31, 2016, based on the closing price of the Trust s stock on the respective dates.
352915_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain hospital properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries.
352915_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	Most of the leases were entered into at the time the Trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5-year renewal terms.
352915_18_ITEM1_P83_S2	Each hospital lease also provided for additional or bonus rental, as discussed below.
352915_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year.
352915_18_ITEM1_P84_S1	The leases with those subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.
352915_18_ITEM1_P84_S2	Total rent expense under the operating leases on the three hospital facilities with the Trust during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $16.0 million, $15.9 million, and $15.6 million, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM1_P84_S3	Pursuant to the terms of the three hospital leases with the Trust, we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term.
352915_18_ITEM1_P84_S4	We also have the right to purchase the respective leased hospitals at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at their appraised fair market value as well as purchase any or all of the three leased hospital properties at the appraised fair market value upon one month s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur.
352915_18_ITEM1_P84_S5	In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for 180 days after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.
352915_18_ITEM1_P84_S6	The table below details the renewal options and terms for each of our three hospital facilities leased from the Trust:
352915_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	We have two 5-year renewal options at existing lease rates (through 2031).
352915_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in various medical office buildings and two free-standing emergency departments ( FEDs ) owned by the Trust or by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds 95% to 100% of the ownership interest.
352915_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	During the first quarter of 2015, wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours sold to and leased back from the Trust, two newly constructed FEDs located in Texas which were completed and opened during the first quarter of 2015.
352915_18_ITEM1_P86_S2	In conjunction with these transactions, ten-year lease agreements with six, five-year renewal options have been executed with the Trust.
352915_18_ITEM1_P86_S3	We have the option to purchase the properties upon the expiration of the fixed terms and each five-year renewal terms at the fair market value of the property.
352915_18_ITEM1_P86_S4	The aggregate construction cost/sales proceeds of these facilities was approximately $13 million, and the aggregate rent expense paid to the Trust at the commencement of the leases was approximately $900,000 annually.

352915_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also impact our business and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	A significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in Texas, Nevada and California.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We own 7 inpatient acute care hospitals and 22 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 15% in 2017, 16% in 2016 and 17% in 2015 of our consolidated net revenues.

352915_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 20% in 2017, 13% in 2016 and 10% in 2015, of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	California: We own 5 inpatient acute care hospitals and 8 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in Item 2.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	On a combined basis, these facilities contributed 11% in 2017, 11% in 2016 and 11% in 2015, of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	On a combined basis, after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense, these facilities generated 13% in 2017, 15% in 2016 and 11% in 2015, of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	The significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative, regulatory, economic, environmental and competition changes in Texas, Nevada and California.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We derive a significant portion of our revenue from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and, in some cases, reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, the vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom are derived from governmental payors.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If the rates paid or the scope of services covered by governmental payors in the United States or United Kingdom are reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $100 million annually from each of Texas, California, Nevada, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and Illinois, making us particularly sensitive to reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors, including managed care providers, significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Private payors, including managed care providers, increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Reductions or changes in Medicare and Medicaid funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	On January 3, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the 2012 Act ).
352915_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The 2012 Act postponed for two months sequestration cuts mandated under the Budget Control Act of 2011.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The postponed sequestration cuts include a 2% annual reduction over ten years in Medicare spending to providers.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In order to offset the costs of the legislation, the 2012 Act reduces payments to other providers totaling almost $26 billion over ten years.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Approximately half of those funds will come from reductions in Medicare reimbursement to hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 has reduced certain sequestration-related budgetary cuts, spending reductions related to the Medicare program remain in place.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	On December 26, 2013, President Obama signed into law H.J. Res. 59, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which includes the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 ( the Act ).
352915_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, on February 15, 2014, Public Law 113-082 was enacted.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The 2012 Act and subsequent federal legislation achieves new savings by extending sequestration for mandatory programs including Medicare through 2027.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Sources of Revenue-Medicare , for additional disclosure.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The 2012 Act includes a document and coding ( DCI ) adjustment and a reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital ( DSH ) payments.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Expected to save $10.5 billion over 10 years, the DCI adjustment decreases projected Medicare hospital payments for inpatient and overnight care through a downward adjustment in annual base payment increases.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	These reductions are meant to recoup what Medicare authorities consider to be overpayments to hospitals that occurred as a result of the transition to Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The reduction in Medicaid DSH payments was expected to save $4.2 billion over 10 years.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	This provision extends the changes regarding DSH payments established by the Legislation and determines future allotments off of the rebased level.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	On February 9, 2018, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1892, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which eliminated the DSH cuts scheduled for 2018 and 2019 but added additional DSH reductions of $4 billion in 2020 and $8 billion a year between 2021 and 2025.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA ).
352915_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Reconciliation Act ), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the Legislation ), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Although it was expected that as a result of the Legislation there would be a reduction in uninsured patients, which would reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable, the Legislation makes a number of other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	It has been projected that the Legislation will result in a net reduction in Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals totaling $155 billion over 10 years.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Legislation revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning October 1, 2011 for Medicare Part B reimbursable items and services and beginning October 1, 2012 for Medicare inpatient hospital services.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The Legislation and subsequent revisions provide for reductions to both Medicare DSH and Medicaid DSH payments.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The Medicare DSH reductions began in October, 2013 while the Medicaid DSH reductions are scheduled to begin in 2020.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Legislation implements a value-based purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or hospital-acquired condition rates.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government s ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the Legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Pursuant to that decision, the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing Medicaid funding.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Therefore, states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of federal Medicaid funding.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	As a result, many states, including Texas, have not expanded their Medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	CMS has granted, and is expected to grant additional, section 1115 demonstration waivers providing for work and community engagement requirements for certain Medicaid eligible individuals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	It is anticipated this will lead to reductions in coverage, and likely increases in uncompensated care, in states where these demonstration waivers are granted.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The various provisions in the Legislation that directly or indirectly affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The impact of the Legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations, interpretive guidance and possible future legislation or legal challenges.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Certain Legislation provisions, such as that creating the Medicare Shared Savings Program creates uncertainty in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Thus, we cannot predict the impact of the Legislation on our future reimbursement at this time and we can provide no assurance that the Legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Legislation amends several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	While Congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found in violation of such law, the Legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act, although final regulations implementing this statutory requirement remain pending.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	The Legislation also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	As discussed below, should the Legislation be repealed in its entirety, this aspect of the Legislation would also be repealed restoring physician ownership of hospitals and expansion right to its position and practice as it existed prior to the Legislation.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The impact of the Legislation on each of our hospitals may vary.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Because Legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years, we anticipate that many of the provisions in the Legislation may be subject to further revision.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Initiatives to repeal the Legislation, in whole or in part, to delay elements of implementation or funding, and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions have been persistent.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	The ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the Legislation and legal challenges to the Legislation are unknown.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Legislation has already been enacted that has repealed the individual mandate to obtain health insurance penalty that was part of the original Legislation.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In addition, Congress is considering legislation that would, in material part: (i) eliminate the large employer mandate to obtain or provide health insurance coverage, respectively; (ii) permit insurers to impose a surcharge up to 30 percent on individuals who go uninsured for more than two months and then purchase coverage; (iii) provide tax credits towards the purchase of health insurance, with a phase-out of tax credits accordingly to income level; (iv) expand health savings accounts; (v) impose a per capita cap on federal funding of state Medicaid programs, or, if elected by a state, transition federal funding to block grants, and; (vi) permit states to seek a waiver of certain federal requirements that would allow such state to define essential health benefits differently from federal standards and that would allow certain commercial health plans to take health status, including pre-existing conditions, into account in setting premiums.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In addition to legislative changes, the Legislation can be significantly impacted by executive branch actions.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In relevant part, President Trump has already taken executive actions: (i) requiring all federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Legislation to exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waiver, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay parts of the Legislation that place unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens on states, individuals or health care providers; (ii) the issuance of a proposed rule by the Department of Labor to enable the formation of health plans that would be exempt from certain Legislation essential health benefits requirements, and; (iii) eliminating cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers that would otherwise offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses for health plan enrollees at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	worsen the individual and small group market risk pools in future years.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	It is also anticipated that these and future policies may create additional cost and reimbursement pressures on hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	It remains unclear what portions of the Legislation may remain, or whether any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally, and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on our hospitals, including their ability to compete with alternative healthcare services funded by such potential legislation, or for our hospitals to receive payment for services.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P25_S5	We are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P25_S6	In accordance with our internal policies and procedures, as well as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and/or seeking medical treatment (whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay) to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P25_S7	If it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition, we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient s medical condition, within the facility s capability, or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital s written procedures.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P25_S8	Our obligations under EMTALA may increase substantially going forward; CMS has sought stakeholder comments concerning the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively, but has yet to issue further guidance in response to that request.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P25_S9	If the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly, or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under EMTALA is proposed and adopted, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P25_S10	If we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price, patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In recent years, the number of quality measures that hospitals are required to report publicly has increased.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	CMS publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the Medicare program.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Additionally, the Legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish, update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If any of our hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys (or results that are lower than our competitors) or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volume could decline because patients may elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	This circumstance could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	An increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Collection of receivables from third-party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient s responsibility, which primarily includes co-payments and deductibles.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S7	However, we also have substantial receivables due to us from certain state-based funding programs.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S8	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix, the agings of the receivables, historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S9	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S10	Significant changes in business office operations, payor mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S11	If we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses, our results of operations will be harmed.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S12	Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P27_S13	The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals, and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sales and income taxes.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Such exemptions and support are not available to us.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The number of inpatient facilities, as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers, many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians, in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a result, most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom where the National Health Service (the NHS ) is the principal provider of healthcare services.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition to the NHS, we face competition in the United Kingdom from independent sector providers and other publicly funded entities for patients.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	As a result, the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals, and, in a number of our markets, physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	They may terminate their affiliation with us at any time.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	If we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards, adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P32_S5	It may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals are located.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Generally, the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P32_S8	The loss of one or more of these physicians, even if temporary, could cause a material reduction in our revenues, which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	If we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment, our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The technology used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and, as a result, manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	To compete effectively, we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry, patients may seek treatment from other providers and/or physicians may refer their patients to alternate sources, which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If we fail to continue to meet the meaningful use criteria related to electronic health record systems ( EHR ), our operations could be harmed.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Pursuant to HITECH regulations, hospitals that did not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 were subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ) standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P34_S6	However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P34_S9	We depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P34_S10	We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	This shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, in some markets like California, there are requirements to maintain specified nurse-staffing levels.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P35_S3	To the extent we cannot meet those levels, we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets, which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P35_S4	We cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P35_S5	If our general labor and related expenses increase, we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P35_S7	Increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P35_S8	Union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future, to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionized, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P35_S9	If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things: hospital billing practices and prices for services; relationships with physicians and other referral sources; adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services; ownership of facilities; qualifications of medical and support personnel; confidentiality, maintenance, privacy and security issues associated with health-related information and patient medical records; the screening, stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions; certification, licensure and accreditation of our facilities; operating policies and procedures, and; construction or expansion of facilities and services.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Among these laws are the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, ( HIPAA ), the federal anti-kickback statute and the provision of the Social Security Act commonly known as the Stark Law.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	These laws, and particularly the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities, including employment contracts, leases and professional service agreements.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	We also provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	A number of our current arrangements, including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti-kickback statute.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	CMS published a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol, which is intended to allow providers to self-disclose actual or potential violations of the Stark law.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the Stark law, there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the Stark Law or that self-disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Federal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that require us to implement and, in the future, may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient s health and related financial information.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Such privacy and security regulations impose extensive administrative, physical and technical requirements on us, restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information, provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Additionally, recent changes to HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements, including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	These laws and regulations are extremely complex, and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In the future, it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P39_S5	A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws (see Item 3 Legal Proceedings ), or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P39_S6	In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P39_S7	See Item 1 Business Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation .
352915_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Our operations in the United Kingdom are also subject to a high level of regulation relating to registration and licensing requirements employee regulation, clinical standards, environmental rules as well as other areas.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We are also subject to a highly regulated business environment, and failure to comply with the various laws and regulations, applicable to us could lead to substantial penalties, and other adverse effects on our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We are subject to occupational health, safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S5	We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Regulatory requirements affecting us include, but are not limited to, those covering: (i) air and water quality control; (ii) occupational health and safety (e.g., standards regarding blood-borne pathogens and ergonomics, etc.); (iii) waste management; (iv) the handling of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances; and (v) other hazardous materials.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S7	If we fail to comply with those standards, we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S8	We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S9	We are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits, product liability lawsuits, class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S10	Some of these actions may involve large claims, as well as significant defense costs.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S11	We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S12	In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may choose to negotiate a settlement.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P41_S13	Amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	All professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We believe that, based on our past experience and actuarial estimates, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	While we continuously monitor our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P42_S4	We may be subject to governmental investigations, regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The federal False Claims Act permits private parties to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits against companies.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Legal Proceedings for disclosure of current related matters.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The failure of certain employers, or the closure of certain facilities, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The economies in the communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The failure of one or more large employer or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our hospitals operate, could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	The occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations, thereby harming our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	If any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation, such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Additionally, such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	All of our hospitals are deemed certified, meaning that they are accredited, properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the Medicare program.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S3	The effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local and other relevant regulations and standards.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S5	However, should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Our growth strategy depends, in part, on acquisitions, and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S7	We may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not-for-profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S8	Acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S9	We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for-profit healthcare companies, as well as from not-for-profit entities.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S10	Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P49_S11	Also, suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	In addition, many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that affect the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	These laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification and community involvement.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a healthcare facility to a for-profit entity.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation, increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals, increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria, any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital s results of operations, allocation of the purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S6	We may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire, which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S7	We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S8	We may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S9	Integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S10	In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by acquired hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S11	In addition, some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P50_S12	If we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire, operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals, our results of operations could be harmed.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We believe that value-based purchasing initiatives of both governmental and private payers tying financial incentives to quality and efficiency of care will increasingly affect the results of operations of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities and may negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet expected quality standards.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing in federal healthcare programs.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Medicare now requires providers to report certain quality measures in order to receive full reimbursement increases for inpatient and outpatient procedures that were previously awarded automatically.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	In addition, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive increased reimbursement payments, and hospitals that have excess readmissions for specified conditions will receive reduced reimbursement.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Furthermore, Medicare no longer pays hospitals additional amounts for the treatment of certain hospital-acquired conditions unless the conditions were present at admission.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, hospitals that rank in the worst 25% of all hospitals nationally for hospital acquired conditions in the previous year were subject to reduced Medicare reimbursements.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for treating certain provider-preventable conditions.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	There is a trend among private payers toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services, as well.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Many large commercial payers require hospitals to report quality data, and several of these payers will not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet quality standards established by both governmental and private payers.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility s reputation could harm our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S4	We are subject to pending legal actions, purported stockholder class actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S5	We, our subsidiaries, PSI, and its subsidiaries, are subject to pending legal actions, governmental investigations and regulatory actions (see Item 3-Legal Proceedings ).
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S6	Defending ourselves against the allegations in the lawsuits and governmental investigations, or similar matters and any related publicity, could potentially entail significant costs and could require significant attention from our management.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S7	We are unable to predict the outcome of these matters or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any such loss; however, these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S8	We are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S9	Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our legal proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S10	In particular, government investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to material fines, penalties, damages payments or other sanctions, including exclusion from government healthcare programs.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P58_S11	Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted Certificates of Need, or ( CON ), laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition, expansion or replacement, make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, result in the revocation of a facility s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could harm our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization review, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors, including physicians clinical decisions and availability, payor programs shifting to a more outpatient-based environment, whether or not certain services are offered, seasonal and severe weather conditions, including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornados, earthquakes, current local economic and demographic changes.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition, technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S4	A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our facilities could adversely impact our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S5	If a pandemic or other public health crisis were to affect our markets, our business could be adversely affected.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S6	Such a crisis could diminish the public trust in healthcare facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or that are treating (or have treated) patients affected by contagious diseases.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S7	If any of our facilities were involved in treating patients for such a contagious disease, other patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S8	Further, a pandemic might adversely impact our business by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our facilities.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S9	Although we have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, the potential impact of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease with respect to our markets or our facilities is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S10	A worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States could materially affect our business and future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S11	Our patient volumes, revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance, which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S12	Worsening of economic conditions may result in a higher unemployment rate which may increase the number of individuals without health insurance.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S13	As a result, our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes, particularly in less intense, more elective service lines, or an increase in services provided to uninsured patients.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S14	These factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes, revenues and operating results.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S15	In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $3.8 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S16	Should the revenues and financial results of our acute care and/or behavioral health care facilities be materially, unfavorably impacted due to, among other things, a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the United States that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates, a continued rise in the unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P62_S17	Legal uncertainty or a worsening of the economic conditions in the United Kingdom could materially affect our business and future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom affirmatively voted in a non-binding referendum in favor of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (the Brexit ) and it has been approved by vote of the British legislature.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty formally starting negotiations regarding its exit from the European Union.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	The United Kingdom has two years from that date to complete these negotiations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union remains uncertain, including the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Brexit could lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P64_S3	The announcement of Brexit also created (and the actual exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union may create future) economic uncertainty, both in the United Kingdom and globally.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P64_S4	The actual exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P64_S5	Any of these effects of Brexit (and the announcement thereof), and others we cannot anticipate, could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Fluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	If we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future, the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P66_S3	In addition to our operating results, many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P66_S4	These factors include certain of the risks discussed herein, demographic changes, operating results of other hospital companies, changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts, speculation in the press or investment community, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, managed care contract negotiations and terminations, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other developments affecting the health care industry.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	We are exposed to currency exchange risk with respect to the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Pound sterling, because a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in Pounds.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We monitor changes in our exposure to exchange rate risk.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S3	While we may elect to enter into hedging arrangements to protect our business against certain currency fluctuations, these hedging arrangements do not provide comprehensive protection, and our results of operations could be adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S4	We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S5	As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S6	While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S7	For example, we cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S8	We also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S9	If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S10	If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P67_S11	A cyber security incident could cause a violation of HIPAA, breach of member privacy, or other negative impacts.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We rely extensively on our information technology ( IT ) systems to manage clinical and financial data, communicate with our patients, payors, vendors and other third parties and summarize and analyze operating results.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize electronic health records and to become meaningful users of health information technology pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	A cyber-attack that bypasses our IT security systems causing an IT security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws, loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption of our IT business systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of public health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Generally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	As we continue to invest in modern technologies, emergency rooms and operating room expansions, the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care, we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital, such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P71_S3	The deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P71_S4	We require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation, expansion, construction and addition of medical equipment and technology.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P71_S5	We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P71_S6	We cannot predict, however, whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed, which could harm our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	To fund all or a portion of our future financing needs, we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate, long-term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	If any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P73_S3	We depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P73_S4	The expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P73_S5	The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities, which could harm our business.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock is subject to potential increases or decreases.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	At December 31, 2017, 26.1 million shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P74_S3	To the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of Class B Common Stock, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the current holders of Class B Common Stock would own a smaller percentage of that class.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P74_S4	In addition, from time-to-time our Board of Directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P74_S6	Conversely, as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business, we may from time-to-time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P74_S7	Based upon factors such as, but not limited to, the market price of our stock, interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash, repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The right to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of Class A and C Common Stock, the majority of which is owned by Alan B. Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P75_S2	As of March 21, 2017, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 7.5% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect five members of the Board of Directors and constituted 86.5% of our general voting power as of that date.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P75_S3	As of March 21, 2017, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options) constituted 92.5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 13.5% of our general voting power as of that date.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P75_S4	As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P75_S5	Each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds).
352915_18_ITEM1A_P75_S6	In the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock, which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P75_S7	The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P75_S8	Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his family, one of whom (Marc D. Miller) is also a director and officer of our company, and they can elect a majority of our company s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company.
352915_18_ITEM1A_P75_S9	In addition, because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.
352915_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	We own various office buildings in King of Prussia and Wayne, Pennsylvania, Brentwood, Tennessee, Denton, Texas and Reno, Nevada.
352915_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	We hold an 80% ownership interest in this facility through a general partnership interest in a limited partnership.
352915_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	The remaining 20% ownership interest is held by an unaffiliated third-party which leases the property to the partnership for nominal rent.
352915_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	The term of the partnership is scheduled to expire in July, 2047, and we have five, five-year extension options.
352915_18_ITEM2_P1_S3	The term of the lease is coterminous with the partnership term with a fair market value rental of the property during the extension term.
352915_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	Real property leased from Universal Health Realty Income Trust.
352915_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	Edinburg Regional Medical Center/Children s Hospital, McAllen Medical Center, McAllen Heart Hospital, South Texas Behavioral Health Center, STHS ER at Mission and STHS ER at Weslaco are consolidated under one license operating as the South Texas Health System.
352915_18_ITEM2_P4_S0	We manage and own a noncontrolling interest of approximately 50% in the entity that operates this facility.
352915_18_ITEM2_P5_S0	We own minority interests in an LLC that owns and operates this center which is managed by us.
352915_18_ITEM2_P6_S0	We own a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 50% in the entity that operates this facility that is managed by a third-party.
352915_18_ITEM2_P7_S0	We hold an 89% ownership interest in this facility through both general and limited partnership interests.
352915_18_ITEM2_P7_S1	The remaining 11% ownership interest is held by unaffiliated third parties.
352915_18_ITEM2_P8_S0	Land of this facility is leased.
352915_18_ITEM2_P9_S0	These facilities were acquired in late December, 2016, upon our completion of the acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division (the Cambian Adult Services ).
352915_18_ITEM2_P9_S1	At the time of acquisition, the Cambian Adult Services consisted of 79 inpatient and 2 outpatient behavioral health facilities located in the U.K.
352915_18_ITEM2_P10_S0	The Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) in the U.K. reviewed our acquisition of the Cambian Adult Services.
352915_18_ITEM2_P10_S1	In April, 2017, the CMA notified us that they identified potential competition concerns in certain markets and announced its decision to refer our acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC s Adult Services division for a Phase 2 investigation.
352915_18_ITEM2_P10_S2	In October, 2017, the CMA provided the final ruling regarding the Phase 2 investigation requiring us to divest a facility which was subsequently designated to be The Limes, an 18-bed facility which generates less than $1 million in annual income before income taxes.
352915_18_ITEM2_P11_S0	We own or lease medical office buildings adjoining some of our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM2_P11_S1	We believe that the leases on the facilities, medical office buildings and other real estate leased or owned by us do not impose any material limitation on our operations.
352915_18_ITEM2_P11_S2	The aggregate lease payments on facilities leased by us were $80 million in 2017, $74 million in 2016 and $69 million in 2015.
352915_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry which subjects us to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations.
352915_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	These claims or suits include claims for damages for personal injuries, medical malpractice, commercial/contractual disputes, wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians staff privileges, and employment related claims.
352915_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	In addition, health care companies are subject to investigations and/or actions by various state and federal governmental agencies or those bringing claims on their behalf.
352915_18_ITEM3_P0_S3	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations against healthcare providers concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes as well as compliance with clinical and operational regulations.
352915_18_ITEM3_P0_S4	Currently, and from time to time, we and some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries in the form of subpoenas, Civil Investigative Demands, audits and other document requests from various federal and state agencies.
352915_18_ITEM3_P0_S5	These inquiries can lead to notices and/or actions including repayment obligations from state and federal government agencies associated with potential non-compliance with laws and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM3_P0_S6	Further, the federal False Claim Act allows private individuals to bring lawsuits (qui tam actions) against healthcare providers that submit claims for payments to the government.
352915_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	Various states have also adopted similar statutes.
352915_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	When such a claim is filed, the government will investigate the matter and decide if they are going to intervene in the pending case.
352915_18_ITEM3_P1_S2	These qui tam lawsuits are placed under seal by the court to comply with the False Claims Act s requirements.
352915_18_ITEM3_P1_S3	If the government chooses not to intervene, the private individual(s) can proceed independently on behalf of the government.
352915_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	Health care providers that are found to violate the False Claims Act may be subject to substantial monetary fines/penalties as well as face potential exclusion from participating in government health care programs or be required to comply with Corporate Integrity Agreements as a condition of a settlement of a False Claim Act matter.
352915_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	In September 2014, the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) announced that all qui tam cases will be shared with their Division to determine if a parallel criminal investigation should be opened.
352915_18_ITEM3_P3_S1	The DOJ has also announced an intention to pursue civil and criminal actions against individuals within a company as well as the corporate entity or entities.
352915_18_ITEM3_P4_S0	state and federal surveyors to ensure compliance with program Conditions of Participation.
352915_18_ITEM3_P4_S1	In the event a facility is found to be out of compliance with a Condition of Participation and unable to remedy the alleged deficiency(s), the facility faces termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or compliance with a System Improvement Agreement to remedy deficiencies and ensure compliance.
352915_18_ITEM3_P5_S0	The laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry are complex covering, among other things, government healthcare participation requirements, licensure, certification and accreditation, privacy of patient information, reimbursement for patient services as well as fraud and abuse compliance.
352915_18_ITEM3_P5_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and expanding.
352915_18_ITEM3_P5_S2	Further, the Affordable Care Act has added additional obligations on healthcare providers to report and refund overpayments by government healthcare programs and authorizes the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.
352915_18_ITEM3_P5_S3	We monitor our business and have developed an ethics and compliance program with respect to these complex laws, rules and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM3_P5_S4	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with government regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with the sanctions referenced above which include fines, penalties and/or substantial damages, repayment obligations, payment suspensions, licensure revocation, and expulsion from government healthcare programs.
352915_18_ITEM3_P5_S5	Even if we were to ultimately prevail in any action brought against us or our facilities or in responding to any inquiry, such action or inquiry could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_18_ITEM3_P6_S0	In February, 2013, the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and certain UHS owned behavioral health facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_18_ITEM3_P6_S1	Prior to receipt of this subpoena, some of these facilities had received independent subpoenas from state or federal agencies.
352915_18_ITEM3_P6_S2	Subsequent to the February 2013 subpoenas, some of the facilities above have received additional, specific subpoenas or other document and information requests.
352915_18_ITEM3_P6_S3	In addition to the OIG, the DOJ and various U.S. Attorneys and state Attorneys General Offices are also involved in this matter.
352915_18_ITEM3_P6_S4	Since February 2013, additional facilities have also received subpoenas and/or document and information requests or we have been notified are included in the omnibus investigation.
352915_18_ITEM3_P6_S5	Those facilities include: National Deaf Academy, Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons By the Sea, Turning Point Care Center, Salt Lake Behavioral Health, Central Florida Behavioral Hospital, University Behavioral Center, Arbour Hospital, Arbour-Fuller Hospital, Pembroke Hospital, Westwood Lodge, Coastal Harbor Health System, Shadow Mountain Behavioral Health, Cedar Hills Hospital, Mayhill Hospital, Southern Crescent Behavioral Health (Anchor Hospital and Crescent Pines campuses), Valley Hospital (AZ), Peachford Behavioral Health System of Atlanta, University Behavioral Health of Denton, and El Paso Behavioral Health System.
352915_18_ITEM3_P7_S0	In October, 2013, we were advised that the DOJ s Criminal Frauds Section had opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center.
352915_18_ITEM3_P7_S1	Since that time, we have been notified that the Criminal Frauds section has opened investigations of National Deaf Academy, Hartgrove Hospital and UHS as a corporate entity.
352915_18_ITEM3_P7_S2	In April 2017, the DOJ s Criminal Division issued a subpoena requesting documentation from Shadow Mountain Behavioral Health.
352915_18_ITEM3_P7_S3	In August 2017, Kempsville Center of Behavioral Health (a part of Harbor Point Behavioral Health previously identified above) received a subpoena requesting documentation.
352915_18_ITEM3_P8_S0	In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal regulations regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations.
352915_18_ITEM3_P8_S1	The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration ( AHCA ) subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility.
352915_18_ITEM3_P8_S2	River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension.
352915_18_ITEM3_P8_S3	Notwithstanding, CMS continued the payment suspension.
352915_18_ITEM3_P8_S4	River Point Behavioral Health provided additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the Medicare suspension remains in effect.
352915_18_ITEM3_P8_S5	In June 2017, AHCA advised that while they were maintaining the suspension for dual eligible and cross-over Medicare beneficiaries, the Medicaid payment suspension was lifted effective June 27, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM3_P8_S6	We cannot predict if and/or when the facility s remaining suspended payments will resume in total.
352915_18_ITEM3_P8_S7	From inception through December 31, 2017, the aggregate funds withheld from us in connection with the River Point Behavioral Health payment suspension amounted to approximately $10 million.
352915_18_ITEM3_P8_S8	Although the operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2017, 2016 or 2015, the payment suspension has had a material adverse effect on the facility s results of operations and financial condition.
352915_18_ITEM3_P9_S0	The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation referenced above is a False Claims Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities.
352915_18_ITEM3_P10_S0	connection with the civil aspects of these matters.
352915_18_ITEM3_P10_S1	However, changes in the reserve may be required in future periods as discussions continue and additional information becomes available.
352915_18_ITEM3_P10_S2	We cannot predict the ultimate resolution of these matters and therefore can provide no assurance that final amounts paid in settlement or otherwise, if any, or associated costs, will not differ materially from our established reserve.
352915_18_ITEM3_P11_S0	Litigation: U.S. ex rel Escobar v. Universal Health Services, Inc. et.al.
352915_18_ITEM3_P11_S1	This is a False Claims Act case filed against Universal Health Services, Inc., UHS of Delaware, Inc. and HRI Clinics, Inc.

352915_18_ITEM3_P11_S3	This qui tam action primarily alleges that Arbour Counseling Services failed to appropriately supervise certain clinical providers in contravention of regulatory requirements and the submission of claims to Medicaid were subsequently improper.
352915_18_ITEM3_P11_S4	Relators make other claims of improper billing to Medicaid associated with alleged failures of Arbour Counseling to comply with state regulations.
352915_18_ITEM3_P12_S0	The U.S. Attorney s Office and the Massachusetts Attorney General s Office initially declined to intervene.
352915_18_ITEM3_P12_S1	UHS filed a motion to dismiss and the trial court originally granted the motion dismissing the case.
352915_18_ITEM3_P12_S2	The First Circuit Court of Appeals ( First Circuit ) reversed the trial court s dismissal of the case.
352915_18_ITEM3_P12_S3	The United States Supreme Court subsequently vacated the First Circuit s opinion and remanded the case for further consideration under the new legal standards established by the Supreme Court for False Claims Act cases.
352915_18_ITEM3_P12_S4	During the 4 th quarter of 2016, the First Circuit issued a revised opinion upholding their reversal of the trial court s dismissal.
352915_18_ITEM3_P12_S5	The case was then remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.
352915_18_ITEM3_P12_S6	In January 2017, the U.S. Attorney s Office and Massachusetts Attorney General s Office advised of the potential for intervention in the case.
352915_18_ITEM3_P12_S7	The Massachusetts Attorney General s Office subsequently filed its motion to intervene which was granted and, in April 2017, filed their Complaint in Intervention.
352915_18_ITEM3_P12_S8	We are defending this case vigorously.
352915_18_ITEM3_P12_S9	At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_18_ITEM3_P13_S0	In December 2016 a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against UHS, and certain UHS officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws.
352915_18_ITEM3_P13_S1	Plaintiff alleges that defendants violated federal securities laws relating to the disclosures made in public filings associated with practices at our behavioral health facilities.
352915_18_ITEM3_P14_S0	The case was originally filed as Heed v. Universal Health Services, Inc. et. al.
352915_18_ITEM3_P14_S1	The court subsequently appointed Teamsters Local 456 Pension Fund and Teamsters Local 456 Annuity Fund to serve as lead plaintiffs.
352915_18_ITEM3_P14_S2	The case has been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the style of the case has been changed to Teamsters Local 456 Pension Fund, et.
352915_18_ITEM3_P14_S3	In September, 2017, Teamsters Local 456 Pension Fund filed an amended complaint.
352915_18_ITEM3_P14_S4	In December 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
352915_18_ITEM3_P14_S5	We deny liability and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.
352915_18_ITEM3_P14_S6	At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_18_ITEM3_P15_S0	In March 2017, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by plaintiff David Heed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.
352915_18_ITEM3_P15_S1	A notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was filed (Case No. 2:17-cv-01476-LS).
352915_18_ITEM3_P15_S2	Plaintiff filed a motion to remand.
352915_18_ITEM3_P15_S3	In December 2017, the Court denied plaintiff s motion to remand and has retained the case in federal court.
352915_18_ITEM3_P16_S0	The suit alleges breaches of fiduciary duties and other allegedly wrongful conduct by the members of the Board of Directors and certain officers of Universal Health Services, Inc. relating to practices at our behavioral health facilities.
352915_18_ITEM3_P16_S1	UHS has been named as a nominal defendant in the case.
352915_18_ITEM3_P16_S2	In May, June and July 2017, additional shareholder derivative suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
352915_18_ITEM3_P16_S3	The plaintiffs in those cases are: Central Laborers Pension Fund (Case No. 17-cv-02187-LS); Firemen s Retirement System of St. Louis (Case No. 17 cv-02317-LS); Waterford Township Police Fire Retirement System (Case No. 17-cv-02595-LS); and Amalgamated Bank Longview Funds (Case No. 17-cv-03404-LS).
352915_18_ITEM3_P16_S4	The Fireman s Retirement System case has since been voluntarily dismissed.
352915_18_ITEM3_P16_S5	In addition, a shareholder derivative case was filed in Chancery Court in Delaware by the Delaware County Employees Retirement Fund (Case No. 2017-0475-JTL).
352915_18_ITEM3_P16_S6	In December 2017, the Chancery Court stayed this case pending resolution of other contemporaneous matters.
352915_18_ITEM3_P17_S0	These additional cases make substantially similar allegations and claims based upon alleged violations of federal securities laws as well common law causes of action against the individual defendants.
352915_18_ITEM3_P17_S1	All of these additional cases have also named all members of the UHS Board of Directors as well as certain officers of the Company.
352915_18_ITEM3_P17_S2	The defendants deny liability and intend to defend these cases vigorously.
352915_18_ITEM3_P17_S3	At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with these matters.
352915_18_ITEM3_P18_S0	Chowdary v. Universal Health Services, Inc., et.
352915_18_ITEM3_P19_S0	This is a lawsuit filed in 1999 in state court in Hidalgo County, Texas by a physician and his professional associations alleging tortious interference with contractual relationships and retaliation against McAllen Medical Center in McAllen, Texas as well as Universal Health Services, Inc.
352915_18_ITEM3_P19_S1	The state court has entered a summary judgment order awarding plaintiff $3.85 million in damages.
352915_18_ITEM3_P19_S2	With prejudgment interest, the total amount of the order amounts to approximately $9 million, for which a reserve is included in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM3_P19_S3	A trial on punitive damages, emotional distress and attorneys fees remains to be conducted if the summary judgment order is not vacated.
352915_18_ITEM3_P19_S4	The case has been removed to federal court.
352915_18_ITEM3_P20_S0	In February 2018, the federal court denied plaintiffs motion to remand and retained the case in federal court.
352915_18_ITEM3_P20_S1	Plaintiffs have filed a writ of mandamus with the 5 th Circuit Court of Appeals seeking to overturn the federal court s decision denying remand.
352915_18_ITEM3_P20_S2	We have filed a motion for reconsideration of state court s summary judgment order in the federal court proceeding.
352915_18_ITEM3_P21_S0	Disproportionate Share Hospital Payment Matter: In late September, 2015, many hospitals in Pennsylvania, including seven of our behavioral health care hospitals located in the state, received letters from the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (the Department ) demanding repayment of allegedly excess Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments ( DSH ) for the federal fiscal year 2011 ( FFY2011 ) amounting to approximately $4 million in the aggregate.
352915_18_ITEM3_P21_S1	Since that time, we have received similar requests for repayment for alleged DSH overpayments for FFYs 2012 and 2013 aggregating to approximately $11 million.
352915_18_ITEM3_P21_S2	We filed administrative appeals for all of our facilities contesting the recoupment efforts for FFYs 2011 through 2013 as we believe the Department s calculation methodology is inaccurate and conflicts with applicable federal and state laws and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM3_P21_S3	The Department has agreed to postpone the recoupment of the state s share of the DSH payments until all hospital appeals are resolved but started recoupment of the federal share.
352915_18_ITEM3_P21_S4	The Department will likely make similar repayment demand for FFY 2014.
352915_18_ITEM3_P22_S0	Due to a change in the Pennsylvania Medicaid State Plan and implementation of a CMS-approved Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver, we do not believe the methodology applied by the Department to FFYs 2011 through 2013 is applicable to reimbursements received for Medicaid services provided after January 1, 2015 by our behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania.
352915_18_ITEM3_P22_S1	We can provide no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our legal and administrative appeals related to the Department s repayment demands.
352915_18_ITEM3_P22_S2	If our legal and administrative appeals are unsuccessful, our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by these repayments.
352915_18_ITEM3_P23_S0	Matters Relating to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ): The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of PSI) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010: Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_18_ITEM3_P23_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_18_ITEM3_P23_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ.
352915_18_ITEM3_P23_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_18_ITEM3_P23_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_18_ITEM3_P24_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_18_ITEM3_P24_S1	The requested documents were collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_18_ITEM3_P24_S2	Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July, 2011 requesting additional documents, which have also been delivered to the DOJ.
352915_18_ITEM3_P24_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_18_ITEM3_P24_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_18_ITEM3_P24_S5	Other Matters: Various other suits, claims and investigations, including government subpoenas, arising against, or issued to, us are pending and additional such matters may arise in the future.
352915_18_ITEM3_P24_S6	Management will consider additional disclosure from time to time to the extent it believes such matters may be or become material.
352915_18_ITEM3_P24_S7	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_18_ITEM3_P24_S8	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_18_ITEM3_P24_S9	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters described above or that are otherwise pending because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the matter is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_18_ITEM3_P24_S10	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.

352915_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Words such as may, will, should, could, would, predicts, potential, continue, expects, anticipates, future, intends, plans, believes, estimates, appears, projects and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	In evaluating those statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks related to healthcare industry trends and those set forth herein in Item 1A. Risk Factors .
352915_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved.
352915_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	Such factors include, among other things, the following:
352915_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	an increasing number of legislative initiatives have been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level.
352915_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	No assurances can be given that the implementation of these laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	the outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, false claim act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters as disclosed in Item 3.
352915_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	as discussed below in Sources of Revenue, we receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $100 million annually from each of Texas, California, Nevada, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and Illinois); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including Texas, Mississippi, Illinois, Oklahoma, Nevada, Arkansas, California and Indiana, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina.
352915_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	in August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	The 2011 Act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the Joint Committee ), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year (annual reduction of approximately $36 million to our Medicare net revenues) with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs.
352915_18_ITEM7_P17_S4	The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, continued the 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 Act.

352915_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
352915_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	A summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in Note 1 to the financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements, including the following: Revenue Recognition:
352915_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 30% of our net patient revenues during 2017, 32% during 2016 and 34% during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 56% of our net patient revenues during each of 2017 and 2016 and 54% during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_18_ITEM7_P22_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_18_ITEM7_P22_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_18_ITEM7_P22_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P22_S7	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_18_ITEM7_P22_S8	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P23_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2017, 2016 or 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	If it were to occur, each 1% adjustment to our estimated net Medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of December 31, 2017, would change our after-tax net income by approximately $1 million.
352915_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_18_ITEM7_P26_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_18_ITEM7_P26_S6	Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_18_ITEM7_P26_S7	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_18_ITEM7_P26_S8	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_18_ITEM7_P26_S9	Patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_18_ITEM7_P26_S10	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	Generally, patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	Effective January 1, 2016, our hospitals in certain states in which we operate reduced the charity care eligibility threshold to less than the federal poverty guidelines.
352915_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states.
352915_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration.
352915_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned.
352915_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered.
352915_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible.
352915_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient s Medicaid eligibility.
352915_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	When the patient s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending.
352915_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	Although the patient s ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2017, 2016 or 2015 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
352915_18_ITEM7_P30_S3	We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in uninsured discounts amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_18_ITEM7_P30_S4	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable.
352915_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $480 million and $410 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Approximately 87% during 2017 and 85% during 2016 of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts, was incurred by our acute care hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Shown below is our payor mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable, net of contractual allowances, for our acute care hospitals as of December 31, 2017 and 2016: As of December 31, 2017:
352915_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks: We provide for self-insured risks including general and professional liability claims, workers compensation claims and healthcare and dental claims.
352915_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_18_ITEM7_P34_S5	In addition, we also: (i) own commercial health insurers headquartered in Reno, Nevada, and Puerto Rico and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_18_ITEM7_P34_S6	The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_18_ITEM7_P34_S7	Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P34_S8	See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Commitments and Contingencies , for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability, workers compensation liability and property insurance.
352915_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	We have designated October 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of October 1, 2017 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	There were also no impairments during 2016 or 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	During 2015, we changed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles testing date from September 1st to October 1st.
352915_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Management believes that this voluntary change in accounting method is preferable as it aligns the annual impairment testing date with our annual budgeting process.
352915_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The 2015 change in annual testing date did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge.
352915_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state and foreign net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA-17 ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	The TCJA-17 makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations through the implementation of a territorial tax system; and (5) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense.
352915_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118 ) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant has not obtained, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) all of the information needed in order to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA-17.
352915_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	To the extent that a company s accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA-17 is incomplete, a reasonable estimate should be recorded as a provisional amount in the financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	We were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of elements for which our analysis is not yet complete.
352915_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	We recorded the following provisional adjustments: Reduction of U.S. federal corporate tax rate: The TCJA-17 reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Deferred income taxes are based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities under the provisions of the enacted laws.
352915_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	For certain of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, we have recorded a provisional decrease of $97 million and $127 million, respectively, with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred tax benefit of $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	While we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in corporate rate, it may be affected by other analyses related to the TCJA-17, including, but not limited to, our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences.
352915_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax: The Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax ( Transition Tax ) is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits ( E P ) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
352915_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, we must determine, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 E P of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings.
352915_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	We are able to make a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and recorded a provisional Transition Tax obligation of $11.3 million.
352915_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	However, we are continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax.
352915_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Valuation allowances: We must assess whether valuation allowance analyses are affected by various aspects of the TCJA-17 (e.g., deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income).
352915_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	Since, as discussed herein, we have recorded provisional amounts related to certain portions of the TCJA-17, any corresponding determination of the need for or change in valuation allowances is also provisional.
352915_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	The accounting for the above provisional amounts is expected to be complete when our 2017 U.S. Corporate Income Tax return is filed in 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016 and 2015, is due to the tax benefit resulting from our January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, the net favorable impact of the enactment of the TCJA-17 as discussed above, and the tax effects of our foreign operations in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division (acquired in late December, 2016).
352915_18_ITEM7_P45_S4	We expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be significantly lower than our current year effective tax rate, excluding the impacts of the new federal tax reform legislation, attributable to the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate included in the TCJA-17.
352915_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	See Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates below for discussion of our effective tax rates during each of the last three years.
352915_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements: For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements, please see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Accounting Standards as included in this Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	The following table summarizes our results of operations, and is used in the discussion below, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016:
352915_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	Net revenues increased 6.6% or $644 million to $10.41 billion during 2017 as compared to $9.77 billion during 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	The increase was primarily attributable to:
352915_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	$331 million of other combined revenue consisting primarily of the revenues generated at the facilities acquired in December, 2016 in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Adult Services, and the revenues generated at Henderson Hospital, a newly constructed acute care hospital that was completed and opened during the fourth quarter of 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) decreased $21 million to $1.14 billion during 2017 as compared to $1.16 billion during 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	The net decrease in our income before income taxes during 2017, as compared to 2016, was due to the following:
352915_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	$23 million of other combined net decreases, including an aggregate of approximately $20 million recording during 2017 in connection certain matters as discussed in Item 3 Legal Proceedings .
352915_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Net income attributable to UHS increased $50 million to $752 million during 2017 as compared to $702 million during 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	an increase of $45 million resulting from a decrease in the provision for income taxes resulting from:
352915_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	a decrease caused by lower effective rates applicable to the income generated during 2017 in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division.
352915_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015:
352915_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	Net revenues increased 8% or $723 million to $9.77 billion during 2016 as compared to $9.04 billion during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	The increase was primarily attributable to:
352915_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	other combined net increase of $181 million consisting primarily of the revenues generated at 4 behavioral health care hospitals acquired in the U.K. in connection with our acquisition of Alpha Hospital Holdings Limited ( Alpha ) during the third quarter of 2015, and 4 inpatient facilities and 8 outpatient centers acquired during the fourth quarter of 2015 as result of our acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network, LLC ( Foundations ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Income before income taxes (before deduction for income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased $10 million to $1.16 billion during 2016 as compared to $1.15 billion during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	The net increase in our income before income taxes during 2016, as compared to 2015, was due to the following:
352915_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	$25 million of other combined net decreases.
352915_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Net income attributable to UHS increased $22 million to $702 million during 2016 as compared to $681 million during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	a decrease of $14 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded on the $36 million increase in pre-tax income ($10 million increase in income before income taxes plus the $26 million increase in income resulting from a decrease in the income attributable to noncontrolling interests).
352915_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	We believe that providing our results on a Same Facility basis (which is a non-GAAP measure), which includes the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance.
352915_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	Our Same Facility results also neutralize (if applicable) the impact of the EHR applications, the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived assets and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.
352915_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	Our Same Facility basis results reflected on the tables below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below Sources of Revenue-Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs.
352915_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under All Acute Care Hospital Services .
352915_18_ITEM7_P62_S4	The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses.
352915_18_ITEM7_P62_S5	-K. The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care hospital services on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	On a same facility basis during 2017, as compared to 2016, net revenues from our acute care services increased $234 million or 4.7%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	Income before income taxes increased $51 million or 9% to $644 million or 12.3% of net revenues during 2017 as compared to $593 million or 11.8% of net revenues during 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	Inpatient admissions to our acute care hospitals owned during both years increased 6.2% during 2017, as compared to 2016, while patient days increased 3.4%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P63_S3	Adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 5.5% and adjusted patient days increased 2.8% during 2017, as compared to 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P63_S4	The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.4 days during 2017 and 4.6 days during 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P63_S5	The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 61% during 2017 and 60% during 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P63_S6	On a same facility basis, net revenue per adjusted admission at these facilities decreased 0.3% during 2017, as compared to 2016, and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.4% during 2017, as compared to 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P63_S7	The following table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during 2017 and 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Medicaid settlements relating to prior years that is included in our results of operations during 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Dollar amounts below are reflected in thousands.
352915_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	During 2017, as compared to 2016, net revenues generated from our acute care hospital services increased $372 million or 7.3% to $5.48 billion due primarily to: (i) a $234 million, or 4.7%, increase same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) other combined net increase of $138 million due primarily to the net revenues generated at the two above-mentioned acute care hospitals located in Nevada that were acquired or opened during 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Income before income taxes increased $84 million to $642 million or 11.7% of net revenues during 2017 as compared to $557 million or 10.9% of net revenues during 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	Included in these results are the following:

352915_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:
352915_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Generally, patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Effective January 1, 2016, our hospitals in certain states in which we operate reduced the charity care eligibility threshold to less than the federal poverty guidelines.
352915_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	During 2017 and 2016, as compared to 2015, this change resulted in an increase in the charity care component of our total uncompensated care and a decrease in the uninsured discount component.
352915_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	The provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals was approximately $756 million during 2017, $628 million during 2016 and $631 million during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated costs of providing uncompensated care as reflected below were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Amounts included in the provision for doubtful accounts, as mentioned above, are not included in the calculation of estimated costs of providing uncompensated care.
352915_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	The following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care hospital services on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	On a same facility basis during 2016, as compared to 2015, net revenues from our acute care services increased $430 million or 9.4%.

352915_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	In certain markets in which we operate, the ability of our behavioral health facilities to fully meet the demand for their services has been unfavorably impacted by a shortage of clinicians which includes psychiatrists, nurses and mental health technicians which has, at times, caused the closure of a portion of available bed capacity.
352915_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	As a result, we have instituted certain initiatives at the impacted facilities designed to enhance recruitment and retention of clinical staff.
352915_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	Although we believe the impact on these facilities is temporary, we can provide no assurance that these factors will not continue to unfavorably impact our patient volumes.

352915_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	During 2016, as compared to 2015, net revenues generated from our behavioral health care services increased 5.6% or $245 million to $4.65 billion during 2016 as compared to $4.40 billion during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	The increase in net revenues was attributable to: (i) $112 million or 2.6% increase in same facility revenues, as discussed above, and; (ii) $133 million of other combined increases consisting primarily of the revenues generated at the facilities acquired in the Alpha and Foundations transactions.
352915_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	Income before income taxes increased $9 million or 1% to $1.03 billion or 22.2% of net revenues during 2016 as compared to $1.02 billion or 23.2% of net revenues during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P91_S3	The increase in income before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to:
352915_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	a combined net increase of $19 million related primarily to the income generated at the facilities acquired in the Alpha and Foundations transactions.
352915_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	Sources of Revenue Overview: We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.
352915_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services.
352915_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital.
352915_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.
352915_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis.
352915_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.
352915_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage.
352915_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year.
352915_18_ITEM7_P96_S2	Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue.
352915_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts.
352915_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:
352915_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future.
352915_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Reconciliation Act ), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010.
352915_18_ITEM7_P100_S2	Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the Legislation ), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
352915_18_ITEM7_P100_S3	Although it is expected that as a result of the Legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients, which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable, the Legislation makes a number of other changes to Medicare and Medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us.
352915_18_ITEM7_P100_S4	It has been projected that the Legislation will result in a net reduction in Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals totaling $155 billion over 10 years.
352915_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	The Legislation revises reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	The Legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning October 1, 2011 for Medicare Part B reimbursable items and services and beginning October 1, 2012 for Medicare inpatient hospital services.
352915_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	The Legislation and subsequent revisions provide for reductions to both Medicare DSH and Medicaid DSH payments.
352915_18_ITEM7_P101_S3	The Medicare DSH reductions began in October, 2013 while the Medicaid DSH reductions are scheduled to begin in 2020.
352915_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	purchasing program, which will reward the delivery of efficient care.
352915_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	Conversely, certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters; such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or hospital-acquired condition rates.
352915_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	A 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government s ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the Legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	Pursuant to that decision, the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing Medicaid funding.
352915_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	Therefore, states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of federal Medicaid funding.
352915_18_ITEM7_P103_S3	As a result, many states, including Texas, have not expanded their Medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding.
352915_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	CMS has granted, and is expected to grant additional, section 1115 demonstration waivers providing for work and community engagement requirements for certain Medicaid eligible individuals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	It is anticipated this will lead to reductions in coverage, and likely increases in uncompensated care, in states where these demonstration waivers are granted.
352915_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	The various provisions in the Legislation that directly or indirectly affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years.
352915_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	The impact of the Legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations, interpretive guidance and possible future legislation or legal challenges.
352915_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	Certain Legislation provisions, such as that creating the Medicare Shared Savings Program creates uncertainty in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future.
352915_18_ITEM7_P105_S3	Thus, we cannot predict the impact of the Legislation on our future reimbursement at this time and we can provide no assurance that the Legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	The Legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare.
352915_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	The Legislation amends several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers.
352915_18_ITEM7_P106_S2	While Congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found in violation of such law, the Legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
352915_18_ITEM7_P106_S3	The Legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act, although final regulations implementing this statutory requirement remain pending.
352915_18_ITEM7_P106_S4	The Legislation also expands the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid.
352915_18_ITEM7_P106_S5	These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	We have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law.
352915_18_ITEM7_P107_S2	The Legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital.
352915_18_ITEM7_P107_S3	The Legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P107_S4	As discussed below, should the Legislation be repealed in its entirety, this aspect of the Legislation would also be repealed restoring physician ownership of hospitals and expansion right to its position and practice as it existed prior to the Legislation.
352915_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	The impact of the Legislation on each of our hospitals may vary.
352915_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	Because Legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years, we anticipate that many of the provisions in the Legislation may be subject to further revision.
352915_18_ITEM7_P108_S2	Initiatives to repeal the Legislation, in whole or in part, to delay elements of implementation or funding, and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions have been persistent.
352915_18_ITEM7_P108_S3	The ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the Legislation and legal challenges to the Legislation are unknown.
352915_18_ITEM7_P108_S4	Legislation has already been enacted that has repealed the individual mandate to obtain health insurance penalty that was part of the original Legislation.
352915_18_ITEM7_P108_S5	In addition, Congress is considering legislation that would, in material part: (i) eliminate the large employer mandate to obtain or provide health insurance coverage, respectively; (ii) permit insurers to impose a surcharge up to 30 percent on individuals who go uninsured for more than two months and then purchase coverage; (iii) provide tax credits towards the purchase of health insurance, with a phase-out of tax credits accordingly to income level; (iv) expand health savings accounts; (v) impose a per capita cap on federal funding of state Medicaid programs, or, if elected by a state, transition federal funding to block grants, and; (vi) permit states to seek a waiver of certain federal requirements that would allow such state to define essential health benefits differently from federal standards and that would allow certain commercial health plans to take health status, including pre-existing conditions, into account in setting premiums.
352915_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	In addition to legislative changes, the Legislation can be significantly impacted by executive branch actions.
352915_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	essential health benefits requirements, and; (iii) eliminating cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers that would otherwise offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses for health plan enrollees at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level.
352915_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	The uncertainty resulting from these Executive Branch policies has led to reduced Exchange enrollment in 2018 and is expected to further worsen the individual and small group market risk pools in future years.
352915_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	It is also anticipated that these and future policies may create additional cost and reimbursement pressures on hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P110_S3	It remains unclear what portions of the Legislation may remain, or whether any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation.
352915_18_ITEM7_P110_S4	Any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally, and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P110_S5	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on our hospitals, including their ability to compete with alternative healthcare services funded by such potential legislation, or for our hospitals to receive payment for services.
352915_18_ITEM7_P110_S6	The following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years for: (i) our Acute Care and Behavioral Health Care Facilities Combined; (ii) our Acute Care Facilities, and; (iii) our Behavioral Health Care Facilities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	Net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates, which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated.
352915_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease.
352915_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P112_S2	Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_18_ITEM7_P112_S3	Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.
352915_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	Under the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ( IPPS ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P113_S1	Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge.
352915_18_ITEM7_P113_S2	The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s Medicare severity diagnosis related group ( MS-DRG ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis.
352915_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care.
352915_18_ITEM7_P114_S2	This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG.
352915_18_ITEM7_P114_S3	The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity.
352915_18_ITEM7_P114_S4	While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patient s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold.
352915_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1.
352915_18_ITEM7_P115_S1	The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the hospital market basket index, gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services.
352915_18_ITEM7_P115_S2	Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P115_S3	In August, 2017, CMS published its IPPS 2018 final payment rule which provides for a 2.9% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_18_ITEM7_P115_S4	Hospital ( DSH ) payment changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 2.3%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P115_S5	Including the estimated decrease to our DSH payments (approximating 0.1%) and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall increase from the final IPPS 2018 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018) will approximate 1.8%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P115_S6	This projected impact from the IPPS 2018 final rule includes an increase of approximately 0.5% to partially restore cuts made as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, as required by the 21st Century Cures Act but excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, as discussed below.
352915_18_ITEM7_P115_S7	CMS will also begin using uncompensated care data from the 2014 hospital cost report Worksheet S-10, one-third weighting as part of the proxy methodology to allocate approximately $7 billion in the DSH Uncompensated Care Pool.
352915_18_ITEM7_P115_S8	This final rule change will result in wide variations among all hospitals nationwide in the distribution of these DSH funds compared to previous years.
352915_18_ITEM7_P115_S9	As a result of this final change by CMS, we could incur a material decrease in our DSH payments in federal fiscal year 2019 and forward if CMS increases the weighting of the Worksheet S-10 data in the DSH Pool allocation methodology.
352915_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	In August, 2016, CMS published its IPPS 2017 final payment rule which provides for a 2.7% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_18_ITEM7_P116_S1	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required DSH payment changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments would approximate 0.95%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P116_S2	Including the estimated decreases to our DSH payments (approximating -0.8%) and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall decrease from the final IPPS 2017 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017) would approximate -0.2%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P116_S3	This projected impact from the IPPS 2017 final rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as discussed below.
352915_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	In July, 2015, CMS published its IPPS 2016 final payment rule which provided for a 2.4% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate.
352915_18_ITEM7_P117_S1	When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments and Health Care Reform mandated adjustments are considered, without consideration for the decreases related to the required Medicare DSH payment changes and decrease to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments approximated 1.1%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P117_S2	Including the decreases to our Medicare DSH payments (approximating 1.6%) and certain other adjustments, our overall decrease from the final IPPS 2016 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016) was approximately -0.1%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P117_S3	The impact from the IPPS 2016 final rule includes both the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the DSH payments related to the traditional Medicare fee for service, however, it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the Budget Control Act of 2011, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as discussed below.
352915_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	In August, 2013, CMS published its final IPPS 2014 payment rule which expanded CMS s policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard.
352915_18_ITEM7_P118_S1	Specifically, it would require Medicare s external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services for at least two midnights (the Two Midnight rule).
352915_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	A benefit on a case-by case basis for rare and unusual exceptions based the presence of certain clinical factors.
352915_18_ITEM7_P119_S1	CMS also announced in the final rule that, effective October 1, 2015, Quality Improvement Organizations ( QIOs ) will conduct reviews of short inpatient stay reviews rather than Medicare Administrative Contractors.
352915_18_ITEM7_P120_S0	admission dates of January 1, 2016 or later, and the agency indicates that RACs will conduct these reviews focused on providers with high denial rates that are referred by the QIOs.
352915_18_ITEM7_P121_S0	In its IPPS 2017 final payment rule, CMS: (i) reversed the Two-Midnight rule s 0.2% reduction in hospital payments, and; (ii) implemented a temporary one-time increase of 0.8% in FFY2017 payments to offset cuts in the preceding fiscal years affected by the prior 0.2% reduction.
352915_18_ITEM7_P122_S0	In August, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act ) was enacted into law.
352915_18_ITEM7_P122_S1	Included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.
352915_18_ITEM7_P122_S2	Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
352915_18_ITEM7_P122_S3	The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year.
352915_18_ITEM7_P122_S4	The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, enacted on February 9, 2018, continued the 2% reductions to Medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 Act.
352915_18_ITEM7_P123_S0	On January 2, 2013 ATRA was enacted which, among other things, includes a requirement for CMS to recoup $11 billion from hospitals from Medicare IPPS rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P123_S1	The recoupment relates to IPPS documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by CMS.
352915_18_ITEM7_P123_S2	Both the 2014 and 2015 IPPS final rules include a -0.8% recoupment adjustment.
352915_18_ITEM7_P123_S3	CMS has included the same 0.8% recoupment adjustment in fiscal year 2016, a 1.5% recoupment adjustment in federal fiscal year 2017, and a 0.45% positive adjustment in fiscal year 2018 in order to recover the entire $11 billion.
352915_18_ITEM7_P123_S4	This adjustment is reflected in the IPPS estimated impact amounts noted above.
352915_18_ITEM7_P124_S0	On April 16, 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted and an anticipated 3.2% payment increase in 2018 is scheduled to be phased in at approximately 0.5% per year over 6 years beginning in fiscal year 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P125_S0	Inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program are paid under a Psychiatric Prospective Payment System ( Psych PPS ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P125_S1	Medicare payments to psychiatric hospitals are based on a prospective per diem rate with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics.
352915_18_ITEM7_P125_S2	The Psych PPS also contains provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department.
352915_18_ITEM7_P125_S3	In August, 2017, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P125_S4	Under this final rule, payments to our psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 1.25% compared to federal fiscal year 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P125_S5	This amount includes the effect of the 2.6% market basket update less a 0.75% adjustment as required by the ACA and a 0.6% productivity adjustment.
352915_18_ITEM7_P126_S0	In July, 2016, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P126_S1	Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 2.3% compared to federal fiscal year 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P126_S2	This amount includes the effect of the 2.8% market basket update less a 0.2% adjustment as required by the ACA and a 0.3% productivity adjustment.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S0	In July, 2015, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S1	Under this final rule, payments to psychiatric hospitals and units increased by approximately 1.7% compared to federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S2	This amount includes the effect of the 2.4% market basket update less a 0.2% adjustment as required by the ACA and a 0.5% productivity adjustment.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S3	The final rule also updates the Inpatient Psychiatric Quality Reporting Program, which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S4	In November, 2017, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S5	The hospital market basket increase is 2.7%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S6	The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.6% and 0.75% reduction to the 2017 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2018 OPPS market basket update at 1.35%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S7	When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2018 will aggregate to a net increase of 4.2% which includes a 0.8% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S8	When the behavioral health division s partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, we estimate that our Medicare 2018 OPPS payments will result in a 4.8% increase in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S9	Additionally, the Medicare inpatient-only (IPO) list includes procedures that are only paid under the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S10	Each year, CMS uses established criteria to review the IPO list and determine whether or not any procedures should be removed from the list.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S11	CMS is removing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from the IPO list effective January 1, 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S12	Additionally, CMS will redistribute $1.6 billion in cost savings within the OPPS system attributable to changes in the federal 340B hospital drug pricing payment methodology in 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P127_S13	The impact of these IPO and 340B changes are reflected in the above noted estimated acute care division percentage change in OPPS reimbursement.
352915_18_ITEM7_P128_S0	In November, 2016, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P128_S1	The hospital market basket increase is 2.7%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	OPPS market basket update at 1.65%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P129_S1	When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2017 resulted in a net increase of 1.5% which included a -1.3% decrease to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates.
352915_18_ITEM7_P129_S2	When the behavioral health division s partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, we estimate that our Medicare 2017 OPPS payments resulted in a 2.1% increase in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P130_S0	In October, 2015, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P130_S1	The hospital market basket increase is 2.8%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P130_S2	The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2016 OPPS market basket.
352915_18_ITEM7_P130_S3	Additionally, CMS also included a reduction of 2.0%, which the CMS claimed was necessary to eliminate $1 billion in excess laboratory payments that CMS packaged into OPPS payment rates in 2014 resulting in a 2016 OPPS market basket update at -0.3%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P130_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2016 aggregated to a net decrease of approximately -0.2% which includes a 7.0% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates.
352915_18_ITEM7_P130_S5	When the behavioral health division s partial hospitalization rate impact is excluded, our Medicare 2016 OPPS payments resulted in a -1.6% decrease in payment levels for our acute care division, as compared to 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P131_S0	In October, 2014, CMS published its OPPS final rule for 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P131_S1	The hospital market basket increase is 2.9%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P131_S2	The Medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 0.5% and 0.2% reduction to the 2015 OPPS market basket resulting in a 2015 OPPS market basket update at 2.2%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P131_S3	In the final rule, CMS will reduce the 2015 Medicare rates for both hospital-based and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs.
352915_18_ITEM7_P131_S4	When other statutorily required adjustments, hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS for 2015 aggregated to a net increase of approximately 0.2%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P131_S5	Excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact, our Medicare OPPS payment increase for 2015 was approximately 1.5%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care.
352915_18_ITEM7_P132_S1	Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P132_S2	Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided.
352915_18_ITEM7_P132_S3	In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid.
352915_18_ITEM7_P132_S4	All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P132_S5	We receive revenues from various state and county based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate (we receive Medicaid revenues in excess of $100 million annually from each of Texas, California, Nevada, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and Illinois); CMS-approved Medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including Texas, Mississippi, Illinois, Oklahoma, Nevada, Arkansas, California and Indiana, and; state Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including Texas and South Carolina.
352915_18_ITEM7_P132_S6	We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states.
352915_18_ITEM7_P132_S7	We can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	The ACA substantially increases the federally and state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014.
352915_18_ITEM7_P133_S1	However, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of the ACA requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding.
352915_18_ITEM7_P133_S2	Accordingly, many states in which we operate have not expanded Medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level.
352915_18_ITEM7_P133_S3	Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in 2020, as discussed below.
352915_18_ITEM7_P133_S4	We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs:
352915_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	We incur health-care related taxes ( Provider Taxes ) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services.
352915_18_ITEM7_P135_S1	Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs.
352915_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	As outlined below, we derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments.
352915_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	Included in these Provider Tax programs are reimbursements received in connection with Texas Uncompensated Care/Upper Payment Limit program ( UC/UPL ) and Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments program ( DSRIP ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P137_S1	Additional disclosure related to the Texas UC/UPL and DSRIP programs is provided below.
352915_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	Texas Uncompensated Care/Upper Payment Limit Payments:
352915_18_ITEM7_P139_S0	Certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas (Grayson, Hidalgo, Maverick, Potter and Webb) participate in Medicaid supplemental payment Section 1115 Waiver indigent care programs.
352915_18_ITEM7_P139_S1	Section 1115 Waiver Uncompensated Care ( UC ) payments replace the former Upper Payment Limit ( UPL ) payments.
352915_18_ITEM7_P139_S2	These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties.
352915_18_ITEM7_P139_S3	Our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P139_S4	The supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer ( IGT ) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P139_S5	However, the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any IGT on the amount of any private hospital s indigent care obligation.
352915_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	For state fiscal year 2017, Texas Medicaid continues to operate under a CMS-approved Section 1115 five-year Medicaid waiver demonstration program extended by CMS for fifteen months to December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P140_S1	During the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012, the THHSC transitioned away from UPL payments to new waiver incentive payment programs, UC and DSRIP payments.
352915_18_ITEM7_P140_S2	During demonstration periods ending December 31, 2017, THHSC continued to, make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria were met by hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	Supplemental payments are also subject to aggregate statewide caps based on CMS approved Medicaid waiver amounts.
352915_18_ITEM7_P142_S0	On December 21, 2017, CMS approved the 1115 Waiver for the period January 1, 2018 to September 30, 2022.
352915_18_ITEM7_P142_S1	The Waiver continued to include UC and DSRIP payment pools with modifications and new state specific reporting deadlines that if not met by THHSC will result in material decreases in the size of the UC and DSRIP pools.
352915_18_ITEM7_P142_S2	For UC during the initial two years of this renewal, the UC program will remain relatively the same in size and allocation methodology.
352915_18_ITEM7_P142_S3	For year three of this waiver renewal, FFY 2020, and through FFY 2022, the size and distribution of the UC pool will be determined based on charity care costs reported to HHSC in accordance with Medicare cost report Worksheet S-10 principles.
352915_18_ITEM7_P142_S4	For FFY2020 and forward, we are unable to estimate the impact on of these UC program changes on our future operating results.
352915_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments: In addition, the Texas Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver includes a DSRIP pool to incentivize hospitals and other providers to transform their service delivery practices to improve quality, health status, patient experience, coordination, and cost-effectiveness.
352915_18_ITEM7_P143_S1	DSRIP pool payments are incentive payments to hospitals and other providers that develop programs or strategies to enhance access to health care, increase the quality of care, the cost-effectiveness of care provided and the health of the patients and families served.
352915_18_ITEM7_P143_S2	In May, 2014, CMS formally approved specific DSRIP projects for certain of our hospitals for demonstration years 3 to 5 (our facilities did not materially participate in the DSRIP pool during demonstration years 1 or 2).
352915_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	DSRIP payments are contingent on the hospital meeting certain pre-determined milestones, metrics and clinical outcomes.
352915_18_ITEM7_P144_S1	Additionally, DSRIP payments are contingent on a governmental entity providing an IGT for the non-federal share component of the DSRIP payment.
352915_18_ITEM7_P145_S0	THHSC generally approves DSRIP reported metrics, milestones and clinical outcomes on a semi-annual basis in June and December.
352915_18_ITEM7_P145_S1	The size of the DSRIP pool will remain unchanged for the initial two years of the waiver renewal with unspecified decreases in years three and four of the renewal, FFY 2020 and 2021, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM7_P145_S2	In FFY 2022, DSRIP funding under the waiver is eliminated.
352915_18_ITEM7_P145_S3	For FFY2020 and 2021, we are unable to estimate the impact of these DSRIP program changes on its operating results.
352915_18_ITEM7_P145_S4	For FFY 2022, we will no longer receive DSRIP funds due to the elimination of this funding source by CMS in the Waiver renewal.
352915_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	Summary of Amounts Related To The Above-Mentioned Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs: The following table summarizes the revenues, Provider Taxes and net benefit related to each of the above-mentioned Medicaid supplemental programs for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P146_S1	The Provider Taxes are recorded in other operating expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as included herein.
352915_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	We estimate that our aggregate net benefit from the Texas and various other state Medicaid supplemental payment programs will approximate $156 million (net of Provider Taxes of $172 million) during the year ended December 31, 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	This estimate is based upon various terms and conditions that are out of our control including, but not limited to, the states / CMS s continued approval of the programs and the applicable hospital district or county making IGTs consistent with 2016 levels.
352915_18_ITEM7_P147_S2	Future changes to these terms and conditions could materially reduce our net benefit derived from the programs which could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P147_S3	In addition, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	Texas and South Carolina Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: Hospitals that have an unusually large number of low-income patients (i.e., those with a Medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean Medicaid utilization, or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25%) are eligible to receive a DSH adjustment.
352915_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	Congress established a national limit on DSH adjustments.
352915_18_ITEM7_P149_S1	Although this legislation and the resulting state broad-based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the Medicaid program, to date the net impact has not been materially adverse.
352915_18_ITEM7_P149_S2	Upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas and South Carolina s low income patients, five of our facilities located in Texas and one facility located in South Carolina received additional reimbursement from each state s DSH fund.
352915_18_ITEM7_P149_S3	The South Carolina and Texas DSH programs were renewed for each state s 2018 DSH fiscal year (covering the period of October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018).
352915_18_ITEM7_P149_S4	In connection with these DSH programs, included in our financial results was an aggregate of approximately $34 million during 2017, $39 million during 2016 and $36 million during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P149_S5	We expect the aggregate reimbursements to our hospitals pursuant to the Texas and South Carolina 2018 fiscal year programs to be approximately $36 million.
352915_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	The ACA and subsequent federal legislation provides for a significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2020 (see below in Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid Revisions for additional disclosure).
352915_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology.
352915_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in Texas and South Carolina, will be reduced in the coming years.
352915_18_ITEM7_P151_S2	Based on the CMS proposed rule published in July, 2017, Medicaid DSH payments in South Carolina and Texas could be reduced by approximately 20% and 14%, respectively, over the prior federal fiscal year.
352915_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	In Nevada, CMS approved a state plan amendment ( SPA ) in August, 2014 that implemented a hospital supplemental payment program retroactive to January 1, 2014.
352915_18_ITEM7_P152_S1	This SPA has been approved for additional state fiscal years including the 2018 fiscal year covering the period of July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	In connection with this program, included in our financial results was approximately $21 million during 2017, $14 million during 2016 and $10 million during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P153_S1	Assuming the program is approved for the state s 2019 fiscal year, we estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $22 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	In California, CMS issued formal approval of the 2017-19 Hospital Fee Program in December, 2017 retroactive to January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019.
352915_18_ITEM7_P154_S1	This approval included the Medicaid inpatient and outpatient fee-for-service supplemental payments and the overall provider tax structure but did not yet include the approval of the managed care payment component.
352915_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	Upon approval by CMS, the managed care payment component will consist of two categories of payments, pass-through payments and directed payments.
352915_18_ITEM7_P155_S1	The pass-through payments will be similar in nature to the prior Hospital Fee Program payment method whereas the directed payment method will be based on actual concurrent hospital Medicaid managed care in-network patient volume.
352915_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	The timing of CMS approval of the managed care payment component is uncertain.
352915_18_ITEM7_P156_S1	We are unable to estimate the impact of the managed care component of the Hospital Fee program but it could result in a material favorable impact on our operating results in 2018 and 2019.
352915_18_ITEM7_P156_S2	The 2017 impact of the California supplemental payment program is included in the above State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Program table.
352915_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	Risk Factors Related To State Supplemental Medicaid Payments: As outlined above, we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs.
352915_18_ITEM7_P157_S1	The states include, but are not limited to, Texas, Mississippi, Illinois, Nevada, Arkansas, California and Indiana.
352915_18_ITEM7_P157_S2	Failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental Medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	In April, 2016, CMS published its final Medicaid Managed Care Rule which explicitly permits but phases out the use of pass-through payments (including supplemental payments) by Medicaid Managed Care Organizations ( MCO ) to hospitals over ten years but allows for a transition of the pass-through payments into value-based payment structures, delivery system reform initiatives or payments tied to services under a MCO contract.
352915_18_ITEM7_P158_S1	Since we are unable to determine the financial impact of this aspect of the final rule, we can provide no assurance that the final rule will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	Massachusetts Health Safety Net Care Pool ( SNCP ) Included in our 2017 financial results was a $7 million pre-tax charge incurred to establish a reserve related to Massachusetts Health SNCP payments received by certain of our behavioral health facilities during the period October, 2014 through December, 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P159_S1	SNCP payments are made by Massachusetts under the current CMS approved Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver available to Institutions of Medical Disease.
352915_18_ITEM7_P159_S2	During the second quarter of 2017, we received notification that such payments are subject to a retroactively applied uncompensated care cost limit protocol.
352915_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	HITECH Act: In July 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) published final regulations implementing the health information technology ( HIT ) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the HITECH Act ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P160_S1	The final regulation defines the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records ( EHR ) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs.
352915_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria.
352915_18_ITEM7_P161_S1	The implementation period for these new Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs.
352915_18_ITEM7_P161_S2	State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate.
352915_18_ITEM7_P161_S3	Our acute care hospitals may qualify for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria.
352915_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	The government s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.
352915_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	Pursuant to HITECH Act regulations, hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of EHR by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the IPPS standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year.
352915_18_ITEM7_P163_S1	We believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the IPPS standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year.
352915_18_ITEM7_P164_S1	Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P164_S2	In connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals, our consolidated results of operations include net pre-tax charges of $22 million during 2017, $28 million during 2016 and $18 million during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P164_S3	These net pre-tax charges consisted of depreciation and amortization expense related to the costs incurred for the purchase and development of the application, net of EHR incentive income (as reflected in 2016 and 2015 on our Consolidated Statements of Income) and net of the portion of the net expense that was attributable to noncontrolling interests.
352915_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	Federal regulations require that Medicare EHR incentive payments be computed based on the Medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P165_S1	Since the annual Medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on December 31 st , we will recognize Medicare EHR incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year.
352915_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	A significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs.
352915_18_ITEM7_P166_S1	In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow.
352915_18_ITEM7_P166_S2	The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate.
352915_18_ITEM7_P166_S3	Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies.
352915_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	Our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance.
352915_18_ITEM7_P167_S1	Private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy.
352915_18_ITEM7_P167_S2	Private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor.
352915_18_ITEM7_P167_S3	Commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services.
352915_18_ITEM7_P167_S4	To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	Other Sources: Our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage.
352915_18_ITEM7_P168_S1	Such patients are evaluated, at the time of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy.
352915_18_ITEM7_P168_S2	Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.
352915_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	Health Care Reform: Listed below are the Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which are have been, or are scheduled to be, implemented as a result of the ACA.
352915_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	Reduction to Medicare DSH payments, effective in 2014, as discussed above.
352915_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	Expanded Medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments, effective in 2014.
352915_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	The ACA (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal DSH funding from federal fiscal year ( FFY ) 2020 through FFY 2025.
352915_18_ITEM7_P172_S1	The aggregate annual reduction amounts are $4.0 billion for FFY 2020 and $8.0 billion for FFY 2021 through FFY 2025.
352915_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	Large employer insurance reforms, effective in 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	Individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies, effective in 2014.
352915_18_ITEM7_P174_S1	As noted above in Health Care Reform, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted into law in December, 2017 will remove the individual insurance federal mandate after December 31, 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	Federally mandated insurance coverage reforms, effective in 2010 and forward.
352915_18_ITEM7_P176_S0	The ACA seeks to increase competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state insurance exchanges.
352915_18_ITEM7_P176_S1	The ACA also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health status, gender, or other specified factors.
352915_18_ITEM7_P176_S2	We cannot provide assurance that these provisions will not adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for services provided to insured patients, or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward.
352915_18_ITEM7_P177_S0	Value-Based Purchasing: There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services.
352915_18_ITEM7_P177_S1	These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P178_S0	Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates.
352915_18_ITEM7_P178_S1	In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events.
352915_18_ITEM7_P178_S2	Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.
352915_18_ITEM7_P179_S0	The ACA contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing.
352915_18_ITEM7_P180_S0	The ACA prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions ( HAC ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P180_S1	Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments.
352915_18_ITEM7_P180_S2	Additionally, hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.
352915_18_ITEM7_P180_S3	The ACA also required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012.
352915_18_ITEM7_P180_S4	The ACA requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in FFY 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years.
352915_18_ITEM7_P180_S5	HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS.
352915_18_ITEM7_P180_S6	HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions.
352915_18_ITEM7_P180_S7	In its fiscal year 2016 IPPS final rule, CMS funded the value-based purchasing program by reducing base operating DRG payment amounts to participating hospitals by 1.75%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P180_S8	For FFY 2017, this reduction was increased to its maximum of 2%.
352915_18_ITEM7_P181_S0	In the ACA, Congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program ( HRRP ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P181_S1	The HRRP currently assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates for heart failure, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), excluding planned readmissions, when compared to expected rates.
352915_18_ITEM7_P181_S2	In the fiscal year 2015 IPPS final rule, CMS added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P182_S0	The impact of HRRP has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM7_P183_S0	The ACA requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations ( ACOs ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P183_S1	The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services.
352915_18_ITEM7_P183_S2	The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency.
352915_18_ITEM7_P183_S3	ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.
352915_18_ITEM7_P184_S0	In addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P184_S1	The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions.
352915_18_ITEM7_P184_S2	We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments.
352915_18_ITEM7_P184_S3	Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.
352915_18_ITEM7_P185_S0	Finally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls.
352915_18_ITEM7_P185_S1	Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results.
352915_18_ITEM7_P186_S0	Other Operating Results Interest Expense Below is a schedule of our interest expense during 2017, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM7_P187_S0	In June, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended, to increase the size of the Term Loan A facility by $200 million.
352915_18_ITEM7_P187_S1	Interest rates were not impacted by this amendment.
352915_18_ITEM7_P188_S0	The credit agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to expire in August, 2019, consists of: (i) an $800 million revolving credit facility ($403 million of outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2017), and; (ii) a Term Loan A facility with $1.775 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P189_S0	The $400 million, 7.125% Senior Notes matured and were repaid in June, 2016 utilizing a portion of the funds generated from the debt issuances described in (a.), (c.) and (d.).
352915_18_ITEM7_P190_S0	Interest expense increased $20 million during 2017 to $145 million as compared to $125 million during 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P190_S1	The increase was due primarily to: (i) a $25 million increase in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facility and accounts receivable securitization program resulting from an increase in the average outstanding borrowings ($4.02 billion during 2017, as compared to $3.54 billion during 2016), as well as an increase in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities (3.2% during 2017, as compared to 3.0% during 2016); (ii) a $1 million decrease in capitalized interest on major projects, partially offset by; (iii) a $6 million decrease in our interest rate swap expense.
352915_18_ITEM7_P190_S2	Interest expense increased $12 million during 2016 to $125 million as compared to $113 million during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P190_S3	The increase was due primarily to: (i) a $15 million increase in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facility and accounts receivable securitization program due to an increase in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings ($3.54 billion during 2016 as compared to $3.14 billion during 2015), as well as an increase in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities (3.0% during 2016 as compared to 2.9% during 2015); (ii) a $2 million decrease in interest rate swap expense, resulting primarily from the 2015 maturities of previously outstanding interest rate swaps, and; (iii) other combined net decrease of $1 million.
352915_18_ITEM7_P190_S4	The aggregate average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit, demand notes, senior notes, term loan facilities and accounts receivable securitization program were approximately $4.02 billion during 2017, $3.54 billion during 2016 and $3.14 billion during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P190_S5	The average effective interest rate on these facilities, including amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and designated interest rate swap expense was 3.5% during 2017 and 3.4% during each of 2016 and 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P191_S0	Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM7_P192_S0	In May, 2016, we purchased third-party minority ownership interests in six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada.
352915_18_ITEM7_P192_S1	Prior to that date, outside owners held various noncontrolling, minority ownership interests in eight of our acute care facilities and one behavioral health care facility.
352915_18_ITEM7_P192_S2	Each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies ( LLC ) or limited partnerships ( LP ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P192_S3	As a result, since there is no income tax liability incurred at the LLC/LP level (since it passes through to the members/partners), the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provision/benefit.
352915_18_ITEM7_P192_S4	When computing the provision for income taxes, as reflected on our consolidated statements of income, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the third-party members /partners share of the income generated by the joint-venture entities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P193_S0	In addition to providing the effective tax rates, as indicated above (as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income), we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pre-tax income that is attributable to the third-party members/partners.
352915_18_ITEM7_P194_S0	The effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes, minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM7_P195_S0	The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2017, as compared to 2016 and 2015, was due primarily to the following that increased or decreased our provision for income taxes in 2017:
352915_18_ITEM7_P196_S0	a decrease caused by lower effective rates applicable to the income generated during 2017 in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division (acquired in late December, 2016).
352915_18_ITEM7_P197_S0	The impact of discrete tax items did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes during 2016 or 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P197_S1	Previously, in 2016 and 2015, we had provided no deferred taxes related to unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries.
352915_18_ITEM7_P197_S2	As a result of the mandatory repatriation tax provisions in the TCJA-17, we recorded an accrued tax provision of $11 million as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P197_S3	Going forward, we anticipate repatriating only previously taxed foreign income subject to the mandatory repatriation tax and any future earnings that would qualify for a full dividend received deduction permitted under the TCJA-17 for distributions after December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P197_S4	At this time, there are no material tax effects related to future cash repatriation of our previously taxed foreign income.
352915_18_ITEM7_P197_S5	As such, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability related to existing undistributed earnings.
352915_18_ITEM7_P198_S0	Effects of Inflation and Seasonality Seasonality Our acute care services business is typically seasonal, with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
352915_18_ITEM7_P198_S1	This seasonality occurs because, generally, more people become ill during the winter months, which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months.
352915_18_ITEM7_P199_S0	Inflation Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years.
352915_18_ITEM7_P199_S1	However, since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other costs, we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases.
352915_18_ITEM7_P199_S2	Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices.
352915_18_ITEM7_P199_S3	We believe, however, that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable.
352915_18_ITEM7_P200_S0	Liquidity Year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016:
352915_18_ITEM7_P200_S1	Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.183 billion during 2017 as compared to $1.334 billion during 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P200_S2	The net decrease of $151 million was primarily attributable to the following:
352915_18_ITEM7_P201_S0	$16 million of other combined net unfavorable changes.
352915_18_ITEM7_P202_S0	Days sales outstanding ( DSO ): Our DSO are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the year.
352915_18_ITEM7_P202_S1	The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance the end of the year.
352915_18_ITEM7_P202_S2	Our DSO were 53 days at each of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P202_S3	Our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include amounts due from Illinois of approximately $25 million and $38 million, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM7_P202_S4	Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures.
352915_18_ITEM7_P202_S5	Approximately $8 million as of December 31, 2017 and $25 million as of December 31, 2016, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date.
352915_18_ITEM7_P202_S6	Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P202_S7	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois.
352915_18_ITEM7_P202_S8	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due to us from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

352915_18_ITEM7_P217_S1	Approximately $280 million of our 2018 expected capital expenditures relates to completion of projects that are in progress as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P217_S2	We believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM7_P217_S3	We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below.
352915_18_ITEM7_P217_S4	parties thereto, as lenders ( Credit Agreement ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P218_S0	The Fifth Amendment increased the size of the term loan A facility by $200 million and those proceeds were utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of the Credit Agreement.
352915_18_ITEM7_P218_S1	The Credit Agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to mature in August, 2019, consists of: (i) an $800 million revolving credit facility ($403 million of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017), and; (ii) a term loan A facility with $1.775 billion of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P219_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our election at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the lender s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings, or (2) the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings.
352915_18_ITEM7_P219_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the applicable margins were 0.50% for ABR-based loans and 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan-A facilities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had $403 million of borrowings outstanding pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility and we had $329 million of available borrowing capacity net of $33 million of outstanding letters of credit and $35 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to a short-term, on-demand credit facility.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S1	The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S2	The Credit Agreement is collateralized by certain assets of the Company (which generally excludes asset classes such as substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals, certain real estate assets and assets held in joint-ventures with third-parties) and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S3	Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, term loan-A installment payments of approximately $22 million per quarter commenced during the fourth quarter of 2016 and are scheduled through June, 2019.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S4	Previously, approximately $11 million of quarterly installment payments were made from the fourth quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S5	In July, 2017, we amended our accounts receivable securitization program ( Securitization ) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks to increase the borrowing capacity to $440 million from $400 million previously.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S6	Pursuant to the terms of our Securitization program, on which the scheduled maturity date of December, 2018 remained unchanged, substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals ( Receivables ) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S7	We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S8	We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S9	The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S10	The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S11	The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans.
352915_18_ITEM7_P220_S12	At December 31, 2017, we had $420 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, which are included in current maturities of long-term debt as of that date, and $20 million of available borrowing capacity.
352915_18_ITEM7_P221_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had combined aggregate principal of $1.4 billion from the following senior secured notes:
352915_18_ITEM7_P222_S0	Interest is payable on the 2019 Notes and the 2022 Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year until the maturity date of August 1, 2019 for the 2019 Notes and August 1, 2022 for the 2022 Notes.
352915_18_ITEM7_P222_S1	Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 until the maturity date of June 1, 2026.
352915_18_ITEM7_P223_S0	The 2019 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2026 Notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ).
352915_18_ITEM7_P223_S1	The 2019 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2026 Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
352915_18_ITEM7_P223_S2	In June, 2016, we repaid the $400 million, 7.125% senior secured notes which matured on June 30, 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P223_S3	The average amounts outstanding during each of years 2017, 2016 and 2015 under the current and prior Credit Agreements, demand notes and accounts receivable securitization programs was $2.6 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion , respectively, with corresponding interest rates of 2.5%, 2.0% and 1.7%, respectively, including commitment and facility fees.
352915_18_ITEM7_P223_S4	The maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end were $2.7 billion in 2017, $2.7 billion in 2016 and $2.3 billion in 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P223_S5	The effective interest rate on our current and prior Credit Agreements, accounts receivable securitization programs, and demand notes, which includes the respective interest expense, commitment and facility fees, designated interest rate swaps expense and amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts, was 2.8% in 2017, 2.6% in 2016 and 2.4% in 2015.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S0	Our Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S1	The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens and indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, dividends and stock repurchases; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S2	We are in compliance with all required covenants as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S3	At December 31, 2017, the net carrying value and fair value of our debt were approximately $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S4	At December 31, 2016, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were each approximately $4.1 billion.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S5	The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S6	We consider these to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S7	Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 45% at December 31, 2017 and 48% at December 31, 2016.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S8	We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S9	Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement; (ii) the issuance of other long-term debt, and/or; (iii) the issuance of equity.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S10	We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our $800 million revolving credit facility and $440 million accounts receivable securitization program, as well as access to the capital markets, provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S11	However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S12	Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S13	As of December 31, 2017 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $120 million consisting of: (i) $113 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $7 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.
352915_18_ITEM7_P224_S14	Obligations under operating leases for real property, real property master leases and equipment amount to $402 million as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P225_S0	We sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received from these subleases are offset against the expense.
352915_18_ITEM7_P225_S1	In addition, we lease three hospital facilities from Universal Health Realty Trust (the Trust ) with terms expiring in 2021.
352915_18_ITEM7_P225_S2	These leases contain up to two 5-year renewal options.
352915_18_ITEM7_P225_S3	We also lease two free-standing emergency departments and space in certain medical office buildings which are owned by the Trust.
352915_18_ITEM7_P225_S4	In addition, we lease the real property of certain other facilities from non-related parties as indicated in Item 2.
352915_18_ITEM7_P225_S5	The following represents the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:
352915_18_ITEM7_P226_S0	Reflects borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017 as discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements .
352915_18_ITEM7_P227_S0	Assumes that all debt outstanding as of December 31, 2017, including borrowings under our Credit Agreement, demand note and accounts receivable securitization program, remain outstanding until the final maturity of the debt agreements at the same interest rates (some of which are floating) which were in effect as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P227_S1	We have the right to repay borrowings upon short notice and without penalty, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, demand note and accounts receivable securitization program.
352915_18_ITEM7_P227_S2	Also includes the impact of various interest rate swap and cap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2017, as calculated to maturity dates utilizing the applicable floating interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P228_S0	Our share of the remaining estimated construction cost of two newly constructed behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania and Washington that are scheduled to be completed and opened 2018.
352915_18_ITEM7_P228_S1	We are required to build these facilities pursuant to joint-venture agreements with third parties.
352915_18_ITEM7_P228_S2	In addition, we had various other projects under construction as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM7_P228_S3	Because we can terminate substantially all of the construction contracts related to the various other projects at any time without paying a termination fee, these costs are excluded from the table above.
352915_18_ITEM7_P229_S0	Consists of: (i) $73 million related to long-term contracts with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing services for our acute care facilities; (ii) $240 million related to the future expected costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the ongoing operation of an electronic health records application and purchase and implementation of a revenue cycle and other applications for our acute care facilities, and; (iii) a $2 million liability for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future.
352915_18_ITEM7_P230_S0	Reflects our future minimum operating lease payment obligations related to our operating lease agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2017 as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements .
352915_18_ITEM7_P230_S1	Some of the lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease and our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options.
352915_18_ITEM7_P231_S0	Consists of $188 million of estimated future payments related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan (estimated through 2089), as disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , and $18 million of estimated future payments related to another retirement plan liability ($15 million liability recorded in other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2017 in connection with this retirement plan).
352915_18_ITEM7_P232_S0	Consists of accrued and unpaid estimated claims expense incurred in connection with our commercial health insurers and self-insured employee benefit plans.
352915_18_ITEM7_P233_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $229 million, of which $54 million is included in other current liabilities and $175 million is included in other non-current liabilities.
352915_18_ITEM7_P233_S1	We exclude the $229 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments.
352915_18_ITEM7_P233_S2	Please see Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P2_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.

352915_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	February 28, 2018 Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the Registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.
352915_18_ITEM15_P56_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Health Services, Inc.:
352915_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and financial statement schedule, of Universal Health Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
352915_18_ITEM15_P57_S1	We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
352915_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
352915_18_ITEM15_P58_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
352915_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
352915_18_ITEM15_P59_S1	Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
352915_18_ITEM15_P59_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
352915_18_ITEM15_P60_S0	We conducted our audits i n accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
352915_18_ITEM15_P60_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
352915_18_ITEM15_P61_S0	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
352915_18_ITEM15_P61_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P61_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P61_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
352915_18_ITEM15_P61_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
352915_18_ITEM15_P61_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
352915_18_ITEM15_P62_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
352915_18_ITEM15_P62_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P63_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
352915_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2007.
352915_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P66_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

352915_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P69_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	1) BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Services provided by our hospitals, all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours, include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services.
352915_18_ITEM15_P70_S1	We, through our subsidiaries, provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P71_S0	The more significant accounting policies follow: A) Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner.
352915_18_ITEM15_P71_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
352915_18_ITEM15_P72_S0	We record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided.
352915_18_ITEM15_P72_S1	Medicare and Medicaid revenues represented 30% of our net patient revenues during 2017, 32% during 2016 and 34% during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P72_S2	Revenues from managed care entities, including health maintenance organizations and managed Medicare and Medicaid programs accounted for 56% of our net patient revenues during 2017 and 2016 and 54% during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P72_S3	We report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third-party payors and others for services rendered.
352915_18_ITEM15_P72_S4	We have agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates.
352915_18_ITEM15_P72_S5	Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments.
352915_18_ITEM15_P72_S6	Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P72_S7	We closely monitor our historical collection rates, as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms, to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available.
352915_18_ITEM15_P72_S8	However, due to the complexities involved in these estimations, actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record.
352915_18_ITEM15_P73_S0	We estimate our Medicare and Medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information, patient utilization data, government provided data and in accordance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P73_S1	The laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term.
352915_18_ITEM15_P73_S2	Certain types of payments by the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs (e.g. Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, Medicare Allowable Bad Debts and Inpatient Psychiatric Services) are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P73_S3	Such amounts are included in accounts receivable, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
352915_18_ITEM15_P73_S4	The vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom are derived from government based payors.
352915_18_ITEM15_P74_S0	The funding of both federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs, and the government based payor programs in the United Kingdom, are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
352915_18_ITEM15_P74_S1	As such, we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations, if enacted, will not have a material impact on our future government based reimbursements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P74_S2	Adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2017, 2016 and 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P75_S0	We provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates.
352915_18_ITEM15_P75_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable, net.
352915_18_ITEM15_P75_S2	See additional disclosure below in Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.
352915_18_ITEM15_P76_S0	C) Charity Care, Uninsured Discounts and Provision for Doubtful Accounts: Collection of receivables from third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
352915_18_ITEM15_P76_S1	Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility, primarily co-payments and deductibles.
352915_18_ITEM15_P76_S2	We estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix, the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience.
352915_18_ITEM15_P76_S3	We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted.
352915_18_ITEM15_P76_S4	At our acute care hospitals, third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account.
352915_18_ITEM15_P76_S5	For those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients, the patient receives statements and collection letters.
352915_18_ITEM15_P76_S6	Our hospitals establish a partial reserve for self-pay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old.
352915_18_ITEM15_P76_S7	All self-pay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge.
352915_18_ITEM15_P76_S8	Third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge.
352915_18_ITEM15_P77_S0	assistance including our charity care policy.
352915_18_ITEM15_P78_S0	If the patient is deemed unwilling to pay, the account is written-off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort.
352915_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	Historically, a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which, in part, has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles.
352915_18_ITEM15_P79_S1	Patients treated at our hospitals for non-elective services, who have gross income less than 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, are deemed eligible for charity care.
352915_18_ITEM15_P80_S0	The federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size.
352915_18_ITEM15_P80_S1	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable, net.
352915_18_ITEM15_P80_S2	A portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of Medicaid accounts that are pending approval from third-party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states.
352915_18_ITEM15_P81_S0	Our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration.
352915_18_ITEM15_P81_S1	At that time, an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned.
352915_18_ITEM15_P81_S2	There are various pre-established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered.
352915_18_ITEM15_P81_S3	Certain patients may be classified as Medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently Medicaid eligible.
352915_18_ITEM15_P82_S0	When a patient is registered as Medicaid eligible or Medicaid pending, our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established Medicaid reimbursement rates, subject to the ultimate disposition of the patient s Medicaid eligibility.
352915_18_ITEM15_P82_S1	When the patient s ultimate eligibility is determined, reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as Medicaid pending.
352915_18_ITEM15_P82_S2	Although the patient s ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period, these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2017, 2016 or 2015 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible.
352915_18_ITEM15_P82_S3	We also provide discounts to uninsured patients (included in uninsured discounts amounts below) who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
352915_18_ITEM15_P82_S4	Because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts, they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable.
352915_18_ITEM15_P83_S0	In implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs, charity care or any other discount program.
352915_18_ITEM15_P83_S1	If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
352915_18_ITEM15_P84_S0	On a consolidated basis, we monitor our total self-pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience.
352915_18_ITEM15_P84_S1	Our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $480 million and $410 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	Uncompensated care (charity care and uninsured discounts):
352915_18_ITEM15_P86_S0	The following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:
352915_18_ITEM15_P87_S0	The provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals was approximately $756 million during 2017, $628 million during 2016 and $631 million during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P88_S0	The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care: The estimated cost of providing uncompensated care, as reflected below, were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.
352915_18_ITEM15_P88_S1	The percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P88_S2	An increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results.
352915_18_ITEM15_P89_S0	Our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include amounts due from Illinois of approximately $25 million and $38 million, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P89_S1	Collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures.
352915_18_ITEM15_P89_S2	Approximately $8 million as of December 31, 2017 and $25 million as of December 31, 2016, of the receivables due from Illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days, as of each respective date.
352915_18_ITEM15_P89_S3	Although the accounts receivable due from Illinois could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future, since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us, no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P89_S4	However, we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from Illinois.
352915_18_ITEM15_P89_S5	Failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due to us from Illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
352915_18_ITEM15_P90_S0	D) Concentration of Revenues: Our six acute care hospitals in the Las Vegas, Nevada market contributed, on a combined basis, 15% in 2017, 14% in 2016 and 13% in 2015 of our consolidated net revenues.
352915_18_ITEM15_P90_S1	E) Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
352915_18_ITEM15_P90_S2	F) Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost.
352915_18_ITEM15_P90_S3	Expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts.
352915_18_ITEM15_P90_S4	Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred.
352915_18_ITEM15_P90_S5	We remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P91_S0	Construction-in-progress includes both construction projects and equipment not yet placed into service.
352915_18_ITEM15_P91_S1	While in progress, we capitalized interest on major construction projects and the development and implementation of information technology applications amounting to $1.0 million during 2017, $1.9 million during 2016 and $304,000 during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P92_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements (twenty to forty years) and equipment (three to fifteen years).
352915_18_ITEM15_P92_S1	Depreciation expense was $388.4 million during 2017, $350.8 million during 2016 and $337.5 million during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P93_S0	G) Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
352915_18_ITEM15_P93_S1	The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow.
352915_18_ITEM15_P93_S2	If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.
352915_18_ITEM15_P93_S3	Fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.
352915_18_ITEM15_P94_S0	H) Goodwill: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise.
352915_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit.
352915_18_ITEM15_P95_S1	We have designated October 1 st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed impairment assessments as of October 1, 2017 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_18_ITEM15_P95_S2	There were also no impairments during 2016 or 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P95_S3	Future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment reviews, including profitability and market value projections, could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write-off of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
352915_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2017 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	The increase/(decrease) in the Behavioral Health Services goodwill consists primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments.
352915_18_ITEM15_P98_S0	I) Other Assets: Other assets consist primarily of amounts related to: (i) intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division, Foundations Recovery Network, LLC during 2015, Ascend Health Corporation during 2012 and Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. during 2010; (ii) prepaid fees for various software and other applications used by our hospitals; (iii) costs incurred in connection with the purchase and implementation of an electronic health records application for each of our acute care facilities; (iv) statutorily required capital reserves related to our commercial insurance subsidiary ($110 million as of December 31, 2017); (v) deposits; (vi) investments in various businesses, including Universal Health Realty Income Trust ($8 million as of December 31, 2017) and Premier, Inc. ($33 million as of December 31, 2017); (vii) the invested assets related to a deferred compensation plan that is held by an independent trustee in a rabbi-trust and that has a related payable included in other noncurrent liabilities; (viii) the estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments, as discussed below, and; (ix) other miscellaneous assets.
352915_18_ITEM15_P98_S1	The following table shows the amounts recorded as net intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:
352915_18_ITEM15_P99_S0	J) Physician Guarantees and Commitments: Our accrued liabilities-other, and our other assets included approximately $2 million of estimated future payments related to physician-related contractual commitments as of each of December 31, 2017 and 2016.
352915_18_ITEM15_P99_S1	Substantially all of the $2 million of potential future financial obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2017 are potential 2018 obligations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P100_S0	K) Self-Insured/Other Insurance Risks: We provide for self-insured risks, primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims.
352915_18_ITEM15_P100_S1	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_18_ITEM15_P100_S2	All relevant information, including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.
352915_18_ITEM15_P100_S3	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_18_ITEM15_P100_S4	Our estimated self-insured reserves are reviewed and changed, if necessary, at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense.
352915_18_ITEM15_P100_S5	See Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for discussion of adjustments to our prior year reserves for claims related to our self-insured general and professional liability and workers compensation liability.
352915_18_ITEM15_P100_S6	In addition, we also: (i) own commercial health insurers headquartered in Nevada and Puerto Rico, and; (ii) maintain self-insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims.
352915_18_ITEM15_P100_S7	The ultimate costs related to these programs/operations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported.
352915_18_ITEM15_P100_S8	Given our significant insurance-related exposure, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P101_S0	L) Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P101_S1	We believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry-forwards.
352915_18_ITEM15_P102_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws.
352915_18_ITEM15_P102_S1	We are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P103_S0	Our tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) through the year ended December 31, 2006.
352915_18_ITEM15_P103_S1	We believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal, foreign and state taxes.
352915_18_ITEM15_P103_S2	See Note 6 - Income Taxes, for additional disclosure.
352915_18_ITEM15_P103_S3	Other Noncurrent Liabilities: Other noncurrent liabilities include the long-term portion of our professional and general liability, workers compensation reserves, pension and deferred compensation liabilities, and liabilities incurred in connection with split-dollar life insurance agreements on the lives of our chief executive officer and his wife.
352915_18_ITEM15_P103_S4	Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interest:
352915_18_ITEM15_P103_S5	As of December 31, 2017, outside owners held noncontrolling, minority ownership interests of: (i) 20% in an acute care facility located in Washington, D.C.; (ii) approximately 11% in an acute care facility located in Texas; (iii) 20% and 30% in two behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania and Ohio, respectively, and; (iv) approximately 5% in an acute care facility located in Nevada.
352915_18_ITEM15_P103_S6	The noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances of $62 million and $7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, consist primarily of the third-party ownership interests in these hospitals.
352915_18_ITEM15_P104_S0	In May, 2016, we purchased the minority ownership interests held by a third-party in our six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada, for an aggregate cash payment of $445 million which included both the purchase price ($418 million) and the return of reserve capital ($27 million).
352915_18_ITEM15_P104_S1	The ownership interests purchased ranged from 26.1% to 27.5%.
352915_18_ITEM15_P105_S0	In connection with the two behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania and Ohio, the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the outside owners have put options to put their entire ownership interest to us at any time.
352915_18_ITEM15_P105_S1	If exercised, the put option requires us to purchase the minority member s interest at fair market value.
352915_18_ITEM15_P106_S0	The accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) component of stockholders equity includes: net unrealized gains and losses on effective cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and the net minimum pension liability of a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan which covers employees at one of our subsidiaries.
352915_18_ITEM15_P106_S1	See Note 10 - Pension Plan for additional disclosure regarding the defined benefit pension plan.
352915_18_ITEM15_P107_S0	The amounts recognized in AOCI for the two years ended December 31, 2017 were as follows (in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM15_P108_S0	P) Accounting for Derivative Financial Investments and Hedging Activities and Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts: We manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_18_ITEM15_P108_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_18_ITEM15_P109_S0	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_18_ITEM15_P109_S1	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_18_ITEM15_P109_S2	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within stockholders equity.
352915_18_ITEM15_P109_S3	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_18_ITEM15_P110_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_18_ITEM15_P110_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_18_ITEM15_P110_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_18_ITEM15_P110_S3	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
352915_18_ITEM15_P110_S4	Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement.
352915_18_ITEM15_P110_S5	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_18_ITEM15_P111_S0	We use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates.
352915_18_ITEM15_P111_S1	The effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income and remains there until either the sale or liquidation of the subsidiary.
352915_18_ITEM15_P111_S2	The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
352915_18_ITEM15_P112_S0	Q) Stock-Based Compensation: At December 31, 2017, we have a number of stock-based employee compensation plans.
352915_18_ITEM15_P112_S1	Pursuant to the FASB s guidance, we expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation pursuant to the straight-line method over the stated vesting period of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
352915_18_ITEM15_P112_S2	The expense associated with share-based compensation arrangements is a non-cash charge.
352915_18_ITEM15_P113_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, share-based compensation expense is an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P114_S0	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
352915_18_ITEM15_P114_S1	Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted to give effect to common stock equivalents.
352915_18_ITEM15_P115_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, for the periods indicated:
352915_18_ITEM15_P116_S0	The Net effect of dilutive stock options and grants based on the treasury stock method , for all years presented above, excludes certain outstanding stock options applicable to each year since the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
352915_18_ITEM15_P116_S1	The excluded weighted-average stock options totaled approximately 6.2 million during 2017, 2.2 million during 2016 and 765,000 during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P117_S0	S) Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The fair values of our registered debt and investments are based on quoted market prices.
352915_18_ITEM15_P117_S1	The fair values of other long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are estimated by discounting cash flows using period-end interest rates and market conditions for instruments with similar maturities and credit quality.
352915_18_ITEM15_P117_S2	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
352915_18_ITEM15_P117_S3	Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures included elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P118_S0	T) Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
352915_18_ITEM15_P118_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
352915_18_ITEM15_P119_S0	U) Mergers and Acquisitions: The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions.
352915_18_ITEM15_P120_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
352915_18_ITEM15_P120_S1	Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
352915_18_ITEM15_P120_S2	Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred.
352915_18_ITEM15_P120_S3	The fair value of intangible assets, including Medicare licenses, certificates of need, tradenames and certain contracts, is based on significant judgments made by our management, and accordingly, for significant items we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.
352915_18_ITEM15_P121_S0	During 2013, we entered into a new group purchasing organization agreement ( GPO ) with Premier, Inc. ( Premier), a healthcare performance improvement alliance, and acquired a minority interest in the GPO for a nominal amount.
352915_18_ITEM15_P121_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2013, in connection with the completion of an initial public offering of the stock of Premier, we received cash proceeds for the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in the GPO, which were recorded as deferred income, on a pro rata basis, as a reduction to our supplies expense over the initial expected life of the GPO agreement.
352915_18_ITEM15_P121_S2	Also in connection with this GPO agreement, we received shares of restricted stock in Premier which vest ratably over a seven-year period (2014 through 2020), contingent upon our continued participation and minority ownership interest in the GPO.
352915_18_ITEM15_P121_S3	We recognize the fair value of this restricted stock, as a reduction to our supplies expense, in our consolidated statements of income, on a pro rata basis, over the vesting period.
352915_18_ITEM15_P121_S4	We have elected to retain of portion of the previously vested shares of Premier, the value of which is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.
352915_18_ITEM15_P121_S5	Premier shares held by us after the restrictions have lapsed are adjusted, through accumulated other comprehensive income/loss, to the then current market value as of each respective balance sheet date amounting to $33 million and $23 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P122_S0	W) Provider Taxes: We incur health-care related taxes ( Provider Taxes ) imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services.
352915_18_ITEM15_P122_S1	Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid programs.
352915_18_ITEM15_P123_S0	We derive a related Medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed Provider Taxes in the form of Medicaid claims based payment increases and/or lump sum Medicaid supplemental payments.
352915_18_ITEM15_P123_S1	Under these programs, including the impact of the Texas Uncompensated Care and Upper Payment Limit program, the Texas Delivery System Reform Incentive program, and various other state programs, we earned revenues (before Provider Taxes) of approximately $357 million during 2017, $327 million during 2016 and $307 million during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P123_S2	These revenues were offset by Provider Taxes of approximately $171 million during 2017, $166 million during 2016, $137 million during 2015, which are recorded in other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income as included herein.
352915_18_ITEM15_P123_S3	The aggregate net benefit from these programs was $186 million during 2017, $161 million during 2016 and $170 million during 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P123_S4	The aggregate net benefit pursuant to these programs is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular state s portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P123_S5	In addition, under various disproportionate share hospital payment programs and the Nevada state plan amendment program, we earned revenues of $55 million in 2017, $53 million in 2016 and $46 million in 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P124_S0	X) Recent Accounting Standards: In August, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which adds or clarifies guidance of the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows with the intent to alleviate diversity in practice for classifying various types of cash flows.
352915_18_ITEM15_P124_S1	This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
352915_18_ITEM15_P124_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our statement of cash flows.
352915_18_ITEM15_P125_S0	In March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which amends the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions to require recognition of the tax effects resulting from the settlement of stock-based awards as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur.
352915_18_ITEM15_P125_S1	We have adopted this new standard, which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, as of January 1, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P125_S2	The impact of ASU 2016-09 to date is explained in Note 10-Income Taxes.
352915_18_ITEM15_P125_S3	Since the impact of ASU 2016-09 on our future Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is dependent upon the timing of stock option exercises, and the market price of our stock at the time of exercise, we are unable to estimate the impact this adoption will have on our future financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P126_S0	In May 2014 and March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , respectively, which provides guidance for revenue recognition.
352915_18_ITEM15_P127_S0	The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
352915_18_ITEM15_P127_S1	This ASU also requires additional disclosures.
352915_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	The FASB updated the new revenue standard by clarifying the principal versus agent implementation guidance, but does not change the core principle of the new standard.
352915_18_ITEM15_P128_S1	ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, in July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of this standard, with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P128_S2	We are currently in the process of assessing and analyzing the various sources of revenue and plan to use a portfolio approach as a practical expedient to account for patient contracts.
352915_18_ITEM15_P128_S3	We have a team in place to lead the implementation of the new standard, including the evaluation of our systems and internal controls to ensure adequacy of data and information needed for adoption, as well as assessing the potential impact of the new standard on various reimbursement programs in which our hospitals participate.
352915_18_ITEM15_P128_S4	The team, consisting of representatives across the organization is progressing towards the completion of their evaluation and began drafting required disclosures and updates to our policies and practices in the fourth quarter of 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P128_S5	We are planning to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach.
352915_18_ITEM15_P128_S6	We anticipate the most significant change will be how the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts will be recognized under the new standards.
352915_18_ITEM15_P128_S7	Under the current standards, our estimate for amounts not expected to be collected based upon our historical experience have been included within net revenue.
352915_18_ITEM15_P128_S8	Under the new standards, our estimate for amounts not expected to be collected based on historical experience will continue to be recognized as a reduction to net revenue.
352915_18_ITEM15_P128_S9	However, subsequent changes in estimate of collectability due to a change in the financial status of a payor, for example a bankruptcy, will be recognized as bad debt expense in operating charges.
352915_18_ITEM15_P128_S10	Although we continue to evaluate the impact of this ASU, we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
352915_18_ITEM15_P129_S0	In February, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Update 2016-02 ) , which requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key qualitative and quantitative information about the entity s leasing arrangements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P129_S1	This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.
352915_18_ITEM15_P129_S2	A modified retrospective approach is required.
352915_18_ITEM15_P129_S3	Upon adoption of this new standard, we will recognize significant right of use assets and lease obligation liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as a result of our operating lease obligations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	line basis over the remaining life of the lease within lease and rental expense in the consolidated statements of income.
352915_18_ITEM15_P130_S1	We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
352915_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	In January, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04 ), which removes the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment.
352915_18_ITEM15_P131_S1	A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
352915_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	ASU 2017-04 is effective for the annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted, and applied prospectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P132_S1	We do not expect ASU 2017-04 to have a material impact on our financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P133_S0	In January, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business to clarify the definition of a business in order to allow for the evaluation of whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses.
352915_18_ITEM15_P133_S1	ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
352915_18_ITEM15_P133_S2	The future impact of ASU 2017-01 will be dependent upon the nature of future acquisitions or dispositions made by us, if any.
352915_18_ITEM15_P134_S0	In August, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities", which amends the accounting and presentation of certain hedging activities outlined in ASC 815 and is intended to more accurately present economic results of hedging activities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P134_S1	This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.
352915_18_ITEM15_P134_S2	The adoption is required prospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment.
352915_18_ITEM15_P134_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P135_S0	From time to time, new accounting guidance is issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that is adopted by the Company as of the effective date or, in some cases where early adoption is permitted, in advance of the effective date.
352915_18_ITEM15_P135_S1	The Company has assessed the recently issued guidance that is not yet effective and, unless otherwise indicated above, believes the new guidance will not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
352915_18_ITEM15_P136_S0	Y) Foreign Currency Translation: Assets and liabilities of our U.K. subsidiaries are denominated in pound sterling and translated into U.S. dollars at: (i) the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and; (ii) average rates of exchange prevailing during the year for revenues and expenses.
352915_18_ITEM15_P136_S1	The currency translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
352915_18_ITEM15_P136_S2	See Note 3 - Financial Instruments , Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts for additional disclosure.
352915_18_ITEM15_P137_S0	Z) Supplies: Supplies, which consist primarily of medical supplies, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.
352915_18_ITEM15_P138_S0	2018 Acquisitions: In January, 2018, we acquired Gulfport Behavioral Health System, a 109-bed behavioral health care facility located in Gulfport, Mississippi.
352915_18_ITEM15_P139_S0	Year ended December 31, 2017: 2017 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2017 we spent $23 million to acquire businesses and property.
352915_18_ITEM15_P140_S0	2017 Divestiture of Assets and Businesses: There were no significant divestitures during 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P141_S0	Year ended December 31, 2016: 2016 Acquisitions of Assets and Businesses: During 2016 we spent $614 million to:
352915_18_ITEM15_P142_S0	acquire various other businesses and real property assets.
352915_18_ITEM15_P143_S0	The aggregate net purchase price of the facilities, which were acquired to enhance and expand our existing operations in the U.S. and the U.K., was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their preliminary estimated fair values as follows:
352915_18_ITEM15_P144_S0	Goodwill of the facilities acquired during each of the last 3 years is computed, pursuant to the residual method, by deducting the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities from the total purchase price.
352915_18_ITEM15_P144_S1	The factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill, which may also influence the purchase price, include the following for each of the acquired facilities: (i) the historical cash flows and income levels; (ii) the reputations in their respective markets; (iii) the nature of the respective operations, and; (iv) the future cash flows and income growth projections.
352915_18_ITEM15_P144_S2	The vast majority of the goodwill resulting from these transactions is not deductible for federal income tax purposes (see Note 6 - Income Taxes ).
352915_18_ITEM15_P145_S0	On December 28, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division (the Cambian Adult Services ) for a total purchase price of approximately $473 million.
352915_18_ITEM15_P145_S1	At the time of acquisition, the Cambian Adult Services consisted of 79 inpatient and 2 outpatient behavioral health facilities located in the U.K.
352915_18_ITEM15_P146_S0	The Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) in the U.K. reviewed our acquisition of the Cambian Adult Services.
352915_18_ITEM15_P146_S1	In April, 2017, the CMA notified us that they identified potential competition concerns in certain markets and announced its decision to refer our acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC s Adult Services division for a Phase 2 investigation.
352915_18_ITEM15_P146_S2	In October, 2017, the CMA provided the final ruling regarding the Phase 2 investigation requiring us to divest a facility which was subsequently designated to be The Limes, an 18-bed facility.
352915_18_ITEM15_P146_S3	The operating results for The Limes are reflected as discontinued operations during 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P146_S4	Since the aggregate income from discontinued operations before income tax expense for this facility is not material to our 2017 consolidated financial statements, it is included as a reduction to our operating expenses.

352915_18_ITEM15_P146_S6	Our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was not impacted by our acquisition of the Cambian Adult Services business since the acquisition occurred in late December, 2016.
352915_18_ITEM15_P146_S7	Our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 included approximately $12 million of net revenues generated at the above-mentioned Desert View Hospital representing the facility s net revenues from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2016.
352915_18_ITEM15_P146_S8	The earnings generated by the hospital since its date of acquisition was not material to our 2016 consolidated net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.
352915_18_ITEM15_P146_S9	Assuming the acquisition of the Cambian Adult Services business and Desert View Hospital occurred on January 1, 2016, our 2016 unaudited pro forma net revenues would have been approximately $9.98 billion and our unaudited pro forma net income attributable to UHS would have been approximately $730 million, or $7.25 per diluted share.

352915_18_ITEM15_P151_S0	Other assets includes an indefinite lived tradename for $124 million recorded in connection with the Foundations acquisition.
352915_18_ITEM15_P151_S1	Included in our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 was an aggregate of approximately $30 million representing the net revenues generated at the newly acquired facilities from their respective dates of acquisition through December 31, 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P151_S2	The aggregate effect of the earnings generated by these facilities since the dates of acquisition, less the cost on the borrowings utilized to finance the acquisition, was not material to our 2015 net income attributable to UHS and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share.

352915_18_ITEM15_P153_S0	3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges: During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had no fair value hedges outstanding.
352915_18_ITEM15_P154_S0	Cash Flow Hedges: We manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate.
352915_18_ITEM15_P154_S1	To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts.
352915_18_ITEM15_P155_S0	for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board s ( FASB ) guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
352915_18_ITEM15_P155_S1	For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.
352915_18_ITEM15_P155_S2	Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
352915_18_ITEM15_P155_S3	Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) within shareholders equity.
352915_18_ITEM15_P155_S4	Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings.
352915_18_ITEM15_P156_S0	We use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions.
352915_18_ITEM15_P156_S1	Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.
352915_18_ITEM15_P156_S2	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement.
352915_18_ITEM15_P156_S3	For hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.
352915_18_ITEM15_P157_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties.
352915_18_ITEM15_P158_S0	We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis.
352915_18_ITEM15_P158_S1	We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2017 and 2016 and determined the hedges to be highly effective.
352915_18_ITEM15_P158_S2	We also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows.
352915_18_ITEM15_P159_S0	The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
352915_18_ITEM15_P159_S1	We do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties.
352915_18_ITEM15_P159_S2	We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
352915_18_ITEM15_P160_S0	Seven interest rate swaps on a total notional amount of $825 million matured in May, 2015.

352915_18_ITEM15_P163_S0	We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis.
352915_18_ITEM15_P163_S1	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is based on quotes from our counterparties.
352915_18_ITEM15_P163_S2	We consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities.

352915_18_ITEM15_P165_S0	Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts: We use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates.
352915_18_ITEM15_P165_S1	The effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income and remains there until either the sale or liquidation of the subsidiary.
352915_18_ITEM15_P165_S2	The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

352915_18_ITEM15_P167_S0	On June 7, 2016, we entered into a Fifth Amendment (the Fifth Amendment ) to our credit agreement dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended on March 15, 2011, September 21, 2012, May 16, 2013 and August 7, 2014, among UHS, as borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time parties thereto, as lenders ( Credit Agreement ).
352915_18_ITEM15_P167_S1	The Fifth Amendment increased the size of the term loan A facility by $200 million and those proceeds were utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of the Credit Agreement.
352915_18_ITEM15_P167_S2	The Credit Agreement, as amended, which is scheduled to mature in August, 2019, consists of: (i) an $800 million revolving credit facility ($403 million of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017), and; (ii) a term loan A facility with $1.775 billion of borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P168_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to, at our election: the greatest of (a) the lender s prime rate, (b) the weighted average of the federal funds rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month LIBOR rate plus 1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.50% to 1.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings, or (2) the one, two, three or six month LIBOR rate (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% for revolving credit and term loan-A borrowings.
352915_18_ITEM15_P168_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the applicable margins were 0.50% for ABR-based loans and 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan-A facilities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P169_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had $403 million of borrowings outstanding pursuant to the terms of our $800 million revolving credit facility and we had $329 million of available borrowing capacity net of $33 million of outstanding letters of credit and $35 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to a short-term, on-demand credit facility.
352915_18_ITEM15_P169_S1	The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit.
352915_18_ITEM15_P169_S2	The Credit Agreement is collateralized by certain assets of the Company (which generally excludes asset classes such as substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals, certain real estate assets and assets held in joint-ventures with third-parties) and our material subsidiaries and guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
352915_18_ITEM15_P170_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, term loan-A installment payments of approximately $22 million per quarter commenced during the fourth quarter of 2016 and are scheduled through June, 2019.
352915_18_ITEM15_P170_S1	Previously, approximately $11 million of quarterly installment payments were made from the fourth quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of 2016.
352915_18_ITEM15_P170_S2	In July, 2017, we amended our accounts receivable securitization program ( Securitization ) with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks to increase the borrowing capacity to $440 million from $400 million previously.
352915_18_ITEM15_P170_S3	Pursuant to the terms of our Securitization program, on which the scheduled maturity date of December, 2018 remained unchanged, substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals ( Receivables ) serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings.
352915_18_ITEM15_P170_S4	We have accounted for this Securitization as borrowings.
352915_18_ITEM15_P170_S5	We maintain effective control over the Receivables since, pursuant to the terms of the Securitization, the Receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are wholly-owned by us.
352915_18_ITEM15_P170_S6	The Receivables, however, are owned by the special purpose entities, can be used only to satisfy the debts of the wholly-owned special purpose entities, and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P170_S7	The wholly-owned special purpose entities use the Receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks.
352915_18_ITEM15_P170_S8	The group of third-party conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special purpose entities that securitize the loans.

352915_18_ITEM15_P174_S3	We consider these to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments.
352915_18_ITEM15_P175_S0	The aggregate scheduled maturities of our total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2017 are as follows:

352915_18_ITEM15_P182_S0	In 2005, w e adopted the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan which was amended in 2008, 2010, 2015 and 2017 (the Stock Incentive Plan ).
352915_18_ITEM15_P182_S1	An aggregate of 35.6 million shares of Class B Common Stock has been reserved under the Stock Incentive Plan.
352915_18_ITEM15_P182_S2	During 2017, 2016 and 2015, stock options, net of cancellations, of approximately 2.9 million, 2.7 million and 2.7 million, respectively, were granted.
352915_18_ITEM15_P182_S3	The per option weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $27.05, $23.80 and $21.37, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P183_S0	Stock options to purchase Class B Common Stock have been granted to our officers, key employees and members of our Board of Directors.
352915_18_ITEM15_P183_S1	All stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant.
352915_18_ITEM15_P183_S2	Options are exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year after the date of the grant.
352915_18_ITEM15_P183_S3	All outstanding options expire five years after the date of the grant.
352915_18_ITEM15_P183_S4	As of December 31, 2017, approximately 7.8 million shares of Class B Common Stock remain available for issuance pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan.
352915_18_ITEM15_P184_S0	The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
352915_18_ITEM15_P184_S1	The following weighted average assumptions were derived from averaging the number of options granted during the most recent five-year period.
352915_18_ITEM15_P184_S2	The weighted-average assumptions reflected below were based upon twenty-seven option grants for the five-year period ending December 31, 2017, twenty-seven option grants for the five-year period ending December 31, 2016 and twenty-five option grants for the five-year period ending December 31, 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P185_S0	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon four year yield in effect at the time of grant.
352915_18_ITEM15_P186_S0	The expected life of the stock options granted was estimated using the historical behavior of employees.
352915_18_ITEM15_P187_S0	Expected volatility was based on historical volatility for a period equal to the stock option s expected life.
352915_18_ITEM15_P187_S1	Expected dividend yield is based on our dividend yield at the time of grant.
352915_18_ITEM15_P187_S2	The forfeiture rate is based upon the actual historical forfeitures utilizing the 5-year term of the option.
352915_18_ITEM15_P187_S3	The table below summarizes our stock option activity during each of the last three years:
352915_18_ITEM15_P188_S0	The following table provides information about unvested options for the year December 31, 2017:
352915_18_ITEM15_P189_S0	The following table provides information regarding all options outstanding at December 31, 2017:
352915_18_ITEM15_P190_S0	The total in-the-money value of all stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $85.5 million, $149.4 million and $154.1 million, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P190_S1	The weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding and weighted average exercise price per share for exercisable options at December 31, 2017 were as follows:
352915_18_ITEM15_P191_S0	Assumes a weighted average forfeiture rate of 9.64%.
352915_18_ITEM15_P192_S0	In addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, we have the following stock incentive and purchase plans: (i) the 2010 Employees Restricted Stock Purchase Plan, as amended in 2015, ( 2010 Plan ) which allows eligible participants to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at par value, subject to certain restrictions, and; (ii) a 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at a ten percent discount.
352915_18_ITEM15_P193_S0	There were 23,557, 14,146 and 17,789 shares of restricted stock granted pursuant to the 2010 Plan during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with various ratable vesting periods ranging up to five years from the date of grant.
352915_18_ITEM15_P193_S1	There were 86,693, 75,792 and 68,213 and shares issued pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P193_S2	We have reserved 2.8 million shares of Class B Common Stock for issuance under these various plans (excluding terminated plans and including a reserve reduction during 2015) and have issued approximately 1.5 million shares, net of cancellations, pursuant to the terms of these plans (excluding terminated plans) as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P193_S3	As of December 31, 2017, approximately 1.3 million shares of Class B Common Stock remain available for issuance pursuant to these various plans.
352915_18_ITEM15_P193_S4	At December 31, 2017, 26,069,031 shares of Class B Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of Class A, C and D Common Stock outstanding, for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase Class B Common Stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans.
352915_18_ITEM15_P193_S5	Class A, C and D Common Stock are convertible on a share for share basis into Class B Common Stock.
352915_18_ITEM15_P194_S0	6) INCOME TAXES Components of income tax expense/(benefit) are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM15_P195_S0	On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA-17 ).
352915_18_ITEM15_P195_S1	The TCJA-17 makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations through the implementation of a territorial tax system; and (5) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense.
352915_18_ITEM15_P196_S0	The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118 ) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant has not obtained, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) all of the information needed in order to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA-17.
352915_18_ITEM15_P197_S0	To the extent that a company s accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA-17 is incomplete, a reasonable estimate should be recorded as a provisional amount in the financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P198_S0	We were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of elements for which our analysis is not yet complete.
352915_18_ITEM15_P198_S1	We recorded the following provisional adjustments:
352915_18_ITEM15_P199_S0	Reduction of U.S. federal corporate tax rate: The TCJA-17 reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018.
352915_18_ITEM15_P200_S0	Deferred income taxes are based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities under the provisions of the enacted tax laws.
352915_18_ITEM15_P200_S1	For certain of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, we have recorded a provisional decrease of $97 million and $127 million, respectively, with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred tax benefit of $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P200_S2	While we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in corporate rate, it may be affected by other analyses related to the TCJA-17, including, but not limited to, our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences.
352915_18_ITEM15_P201_S0	Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax: The Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax ( Transition Tax ) is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits ( E P ) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
352915_18_ITEM15_P201_S1	To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, we must determine, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 E P of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings.
352915_18_ITEM15_P201_S2	We are able to make a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and recorded a provisional Transition Tax obligation of $11.3 million.
352915_18_ITEM15_P201_S3	However, we are continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax.
352915_18_ITEM15_P202_S0	Valuation allowances: We must assess whether valuation allowance analyses are affected by various aspects of the TCJA-17 (e.g., deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income).
352915_18_ITEM15_P202_S1	Since, as discussed herein, we have recorded provisional amounts related to certain portions of the TCJA-17, any corresponding determination of the need for a change in valuation allowance is also provisional.
352915_18_ITEM15_P203_S0	The accounting for the above provisional amounts is expected to be complete when our 2017 U.S. Corporate Income Tax return is filed in 2018.
352915_18_ITEM15_P204_S0	The TCJA-17 contains two new anti-base erosion tax provisions, (1) the global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI ) provisions and (2) the base erosion and anti-abuse tax ( BEAT ) provisions:
352915_18_ITEM15_P205_S0	The GILTI provisions require the inclusion of the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in excess of an acceptable rate of return on certain assets of the respective subsidiaries in our U.S. tax return for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P205_S1	Due to complexities around the calculation we have not recorded any provisional deferred tax effects related to the GILTI tax and will not make an accounting policy election at this time with respect to GILTI for our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P206_S0	The BEAT provisions limit the deduction for U.S. tax base erosion related payments made by U.S. operations to related foreign affiliates.
352915_18_ITEM15_P206_S1	We do not expect any BEAT tax for our U.S. operations; therefore, we have not recorded any tax expense related to BEAT tax in our consolidated financial statements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P207_S0	The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $70 million in 2017, $58 million in 2016 and $41 million in 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P207_S1	Previously, in 2016 and 2015, we had provided no deferred taxes related to unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries.
352915_18_ITEM15_P207_S2	As a result of the mandatory repatriation tax provisions in the TCJA-17, we recorded an accrued tax provision of $11.3 million as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P207_S3	Going forward, we anticipate repatriating only previously taxed foreign income subject to the mandatory repatriation tax and any future earnings that would qualify for a full dividend received deduction permitted under the TCJA-17 for distributions after December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P207_S4	At this time, there are no material tax effects related to future cash repatriation of our previously taxed foreign income.
352915_18_ITEM15_P207_S5	As such, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability related to existing undistributed earnings.
352915_18_ITEM15_P208_S0	Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 included tax benefits of $22 million related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.
352915_18_ITEM15_P208_S1	Under ASU 2016-09, we no longer record excess tax benefits (when the deductible amount related to the settlement of employee equity awards for tax purposes exceeds the cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes) in equity.
352915_18_ITEM15_P208_S2	Instead, we recognize these tax benefits (and deficiencies, if applicable) as a component of our tax provision.
352915_18_ITEM15_P208_S3	This reporting change is applied prospectively and prior period amounts are not restated (the excess tax benefit for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, related to the settlement of employee equity awards, were $45 million and $47 million, respectively, and were recorded in equity).
352915_18_ITEM15_P208_S4	ASU 2016-09 requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows rather than as a financing activity, as previously required.
352915_18_ITEM15_P208_S5	We have elected to apply the change to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a modified retrospective basis resulting in a reclassification of the 2016 and 2015 excess income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation from financing activities to operating activities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P209_S0	A reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate is as follows:
352915_18_ITEM15_P210_S0	Our effective tax rates were 32.0%, 35.4% and 34.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P210_S1	The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016 and 2015, is due to the tax benefit resulting from our January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, the net favorable impact of the enactment of the TCJA-17 as discussed above, and the tax effects of our foreign operations in connection with our acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC's adult services division (acquired in late December, 2016).
352915_18_ITEM15_P210_S2	The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily impacted by the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests due to our purchase of the minority ownership interests held by a third-party in our six acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is not tax effected in the statement of income.
352915_18_ITEM15_P210_S3	Including the expense related to income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 32.6%, 36.8% and 36.7%, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P211_S0	Included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are prepaid federal and state income taxes amounting to approximately $5 million and $10 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P212_S0	As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 under the TCJA-17, we revalued our ending deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 and we have recorded a provisional decrease of $97 million and $127 million, respectively, with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred tax benefit of $30 million in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P213_S0	The components of deferred taxes are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM15_P214_S0	At December 31, 2017, state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2018 through 2037), and credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income approximated $1.09 billion representing approximately $70 million in deferred state tax benefit (net of the federal benefit).
352915_18_ITEM15_P214_S1	At December 31, 2017, there were foreign net operating losses and credit carryforwards of approximately $26 million, most of which are carried forward indefinitely, representing approximately $6 million in deferred foreign tax benefit.
352915_18_ITEM15_P215_S0	A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
352915_18_ITEM15_P215_S1	Based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized.
352915_18_ITEM15_P215_S2	Therefore, valuation allowances of approximately $66 million and $52 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P215_S3	During 2017, the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by $2 million due to additional net operating losses incurred and by $12 million due to the reduction of the federal benefit due to the change in U.S. corporate income tax rates.
352915_18_ITEM15_P215_S4	In addition, valuation allowances of approximately $4 million have been reflected as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 related to foreign net operating losses and credit carryforwards.
352915_18_ITEM15_P215_S5	During 2017 and 2016, the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions (including accrued interest and penalties) were increased less than $1 million due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years.
352915_18_ITEM15_P215_S6	The balance at each of December 31, 2017 and 2016, if subsequently recognized, that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately $1 million as of each date.
352915_18_ITEM15_P216_S0	We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision.
352915_18_ITEM15_P216_S1	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have accrued interest and penalties of less than $1 million as of each date.
352915_18_ITEM15_P216_S2	The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2014 and subsequent years.
352915_18_ITEM15_P217_S0	Foreign and U.S. state and local jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years.
352915_18_ITEM15_P217_S1	The statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months.
352915_18_ITEM15_P217_S2	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months, however, it is anticipated that any such change, if it were to occur, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P217_S3	The tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (amounts in thousands).
352915_18_ITEM15_P218_S0	7) LEASE COMMITMENTS Three of our hospital facilities are held under operating leases with Universal Health Realty Income Trust with terms expiring in 2021 (see Note 9 for additional disclosure).
352915_18_ITEM15_P218_S1	We also lease the real property of certain facilities (see Item 2.
352915_18_ITEM15_P218_S2	A summary of property under capital lease follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM15_P219_S0	Future minimum rental payments under lease commitments with a term of more than one year as of December 31, 2017, are as follows (amounts in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM15_P220_S0	We assumed no capital lease obligations in 2017 and assumed capital lease obligations of approximately $152,000 in 2016 and $7 million in 2015, in connection with the leases on certain real estate assets.
352915_18_ITEM15_P220_S1	In the ordinary course of business, our facilities routinely lease equipment pursuant to new lease arrangements that will likely result in future lease and rental expense in excess of amounts indicated above.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S0	8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Professional and General Liability, Workers Compensation Liability Effective January, 2017, the vast majority of our subsidiaries are self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $5 million and $3 million per occurrence, respectively, subject to certain aggregate limitations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S1	Prior to January, 2017, the vast majority of our subsidiaries were self-insured for professional and general liability exposure up to $10 million and $3 million per occurrence, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S2	These subsidiaries are provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self-insured retention or underlying policy limits up to $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred after 2013 a nd up to $200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred from 2011 through 2013.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S3	We remain liable for 10%, up to an annual aggregate limitation of $5 million, of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured excess coverage.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S4	In addition, from time to time based upon marketplace conditions, we may elect to purchase additional commercial coverage for certain of our facilities or businesses.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S5	Our behavioral health care facilities located in the U.K. have policies through a commercial insurance carrier located in the U.K. that provides for 10 million of professional liability coverage and 25 million of general liability coverage.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S6	The coverage for the facilities located in the U.K. acquired in late December, 2016 in connection with our acquisition of the Cambian Group, PLC s adult services division is similar to the above-mentioned U.K. insurance program.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S7	As of December 31, 2017, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $229 million, of which $54 million was included in current liabilities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S8	As of December 31, 2016, the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was $207 million, of which $48 million was included in current liabilities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S9	During 2017, based upon a reserve analysis of our estimated future claims payments, we recorded an increase to our professional and general liability self-insurance reserves (relating to prior years) of $15 million.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S10	Our consolidated results of operations during 2016 and 2015 were not materially impacted by adjustments to our prior year reserves for professional and general liability claims.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S11	As of December 31, 2017, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $70 million, of which $35 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S12	As of December 31, 2016, the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was $67 million, of which $33 million is included in current liabilities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S13	Our consolidated results of operations during 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not materially impacted by adjustments to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims.
352915_18_ITEM15_P221_S14	Below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and workers compensation reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2017 (amount in thousands):
352915_18_ITEM15_P222_S0	Our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.
352915_18_ITEM15_P222_S1	While we continuously monitor these factors, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate.
352915_18_ITEM15_P222_S2	Given our significant self-insured exposure for professional and general liability claims, there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and/or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P223_S0	unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves, as discussed above, it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves.
352915_18_ITEM15_P224_S0	We have commercial property insurance policies for our properties covering catastrophic losses, including windstorm damage, up to a $1 billion policy limit, subject to a deductible ranging from $50,000 to $250,000 per occurrence.
352915_18_ITEM15_P224_S1	Losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3% and 5% of the total insurable value of the property.
352915_18_ITEM15_P224_S2	In addition, we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage, each subject to aggregated loss limits (as opposed to per occurrence losses).
352915_18_ITEM15_P224_S3	Commercially insured earthquake coverage for our facilities is subject to various deductibles and limitations including: (i) $500 million limitation for our facilities located in Nevada; (ii) $130 million limitation for our facilities located in California; (iii) $100 million limitation for our facilities located in fault zones within the United States; (iv) $40 million limitation for our facility located in Puerto Rico, and; (v) $250 million limitation for many of our facilities located in other states.
352915_18_ITEM15_P224_S4	Deductibles for flood losses vary in amount, up to a maximum of $500,000, based upon location of the facility.
352915_18_ITEM15_P225_S0	Since certain of our facilities have been designated by our insurer as flood prone, we have elected to purchase policies from The National Flood Insurance Program.
352915_18_ITEM15_P225_S1	Property insurance for our behavioral health facilities located in the U.K. are provided on an all risk basis up to a 1.29 billion policy limit, with coverage caps per location, that includes coverage for real and personal property as well as business interruption losses.
352915_18_ITEM15_P225_S2	In addition to our long-term debt obligations as discussed in Note 4 - Long-Term Debt and our operating lease obligations as discussed in Note 7 - Lease Commitments , we have various other contractual commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2017 as follows: (i) other combined estimated future purchase obligations of $315 million related to a long-term contract with third-parties consisting primarily of certain revenue cycle data processing services for our acute care facilities ($73 million), expected future costs to be paid to a third-party vendor in connection with the ongoing operation of an electronic health records application and purchase implementation of a revenue cycle and other applications for our acute care facilities ($240 million) and estimated minimum liabilities for physician commitments expected to be paid in the future ($2 million); (ii) estimated construction commitment of $30 million representing our share of the construction costs of two new behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania and Washington that we are required to build pursuant to joint-venture agreements with third-parties; (iii) combined estimated future payments of $206 million related to our non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan ($188 million consisting of estimated payments through 2089) and other retirement plan liabilities ($18 million), and; (iv) accrued and unpaid estimated claims expense incurred in connection with our commercial health insurers and self-insured employee benefit plans ($86 million).
352915_18_ITEM15_P226_S0	Legal Proceedings We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry which subjects us to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P226_S1	These claims or suits include claims for damages for personal injuries, medical malpractice, commercial/contractual disputes, wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians staff privileges, and employment related claims.
352915_18_ITEM15_P226_S2	In addition, health care companies are subject to investigations and/or actions by various state and federal governmental agencies or those bringing claims on their behalf.
352915_18_ITEM15_P226_S3	Government action has increased with respect to investigations and/or allegations against healthcare providers concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes as well as compliance with clinical and operational regulations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P226_S4	Currently, and from time to time, we and some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries in the form of subpoenas, Civil Investigative Demands, audits and other document requests from various federal and state agencies.
352915_18_ITEM15_P226_S5	These inquiries can lead to notices and/or actions including repayment obligations from state and federal government agencies associated with potential non-compliance with laws and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P226_S6	Further, the federal False Claim Act allows private individuals to bring lawsuits (qui tam actions) against healthcare providers that submit claims for payments to the government.
352915_18_ITEM15_P227_S0	Various states have also adopted similar statutes.
352915_18_ITEM15_P227_S1	When such a claim is filed, the government will investigate the matter and decide if they are going to intervene in the pending case.
352915_18_ITEM15_P227_S2	These qui tam lawsuits are placed under seal by the court to comply with the False Claims Act s requirements.
352915_18_ITEM15_P227_S3	If the government chooses not to intervene, the private individual(s) can proceed independently on behalf of the government.
352915_18_ITEM15_P228_S0	Health care providers that are found to violate the False Claims Act may be subject to substantial monetary fines/penalties as well as face potential exclusion from participating in government health care programs or be required to comply with Corporate Integrity Agreements as a condition of a settlement of a False Claim Act matter.
352915_18_ITEM15_P229_S0	In September 2014, the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) announced that all qui tam cases will be shared with their Division to determine if a parallel criminal investigation should be opened.
352915_18_ITEM15_P229_S1	The DOJ has also announced an intention to pursue civil and criminal actions against individuals within a company as well as the corporate entity or entities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P229_S2	In addition, health care facilities are subject to monitoring by state and federal surveyors to ensure compliance with program Conditions of Participation.
352915_18_ITEM15_P229_S3	In the event a facility is found to be out of compliance with a Condition of Participation and unable to remedy the alleged deficiency(s), the facility faces termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or compliance with a System Improvement Agreement to remedy deficiencies and ensure compliance.
352915_18_ITEM15_P230_S0	The laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry are complex covering, among other things, government healthcare participation requirements, licensure, certification and accreditation, privacy of patient information, reimbursement for patient services as well as fraud and abuse compliance.
352915_18_ITEM15_P230_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and expanding.
352915_18_ITEM15_P230_S2	Further, the Affordable Care Act has added additional obligations on healthcare providers to report and refund overpayments by government healthcare programs and authorizes the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud.
352915_18_ITEM15_P230_S3	We monitor our business and have developed an ethics and compliance program with respect to these complex laws, rules and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P230_S4	Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with government regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be faced with the sanctions referenced above which include fines, penalties and/or substantial damages, repayment obligations, payment suspensions, licensure revocation, and expulsion from government healthcare programs.
352915_18_ITEM15_P230_S5	Even if we were to ultimately prevail in any action brought against us or our facilities or in responding to any inquiry, such action or inquiry could have a material adverse effect on us.
352915_18_ITEM15_P231_S0	In February, 2013, the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) served a subpoena requesting various documents from January, 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at Universal Health Services, Inc. ( UHS ) concerning it and UHS of Delaware, Inc., and certain UHS owned behavioral health facilities including: Keys of Carolina, Old Vineyard Behavioral Health, The Meadows Psychiatric Center, Streamwood Behavioral Health, Hartgrove Hospital, Rock River Academy and Residential Treatment Center, Roxbury Treatment Center, Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center, f/k/a The Pines Residential Treatment Center, including the Crawford, Brighton and Kempsville campuses, Wekiva Springs Center and River Point Behavioral Health.
352915_18_ITEM15_P231_S1	Prior to receipt of this subpoena, some of these facilities had received independent subpoenas from state or federal agencies.
352915_18_ITEM15_P231_S2	Subsequent to the February 2013 subpoenas, some of the facilities above have received additional, specific subpoenas or other document and information requests.
352915_18_ITEM15_P231_S3	In addition to the OIG, the DOJ and various U.S. Attorneys and state Attorneys General Offices are also involved in this matter.
352915_18_ITEM15_P231_S4	Since February 2013, additional facilities have also received subpoenas and/or document and information requests or we have been notified are included in the omnibus investigation.
352915_18_ITEM15_P231_S5	Those facilities include: National Deaf Academy, Arbour-HRI Hospital, Behavioral Hospital of Bellaire, St. Simons By the Sea, Turning Point Care Center, Salt Lake Behavioral Health, Central Florida Behavioral Hospital, University Behavioral Center, Arbour Hospital, Arbour-Fuller Hospital, Pembroke Hospital, Westwood Lodge, Coastal Harbor Health System, Shadow Mountain Behavioral Health, Cedar Hills Hospital, Mayhill Hospital, Southern Crescent Behavioral Health (Anchor Hospital and Crescent Pines campuses), Valley Hospital (AZ), Peachford Behavioral Health System of Atlanta, University Behavioral Health of Denton, and El Paso Behavioral Health System.
352915_18_ITEM15_P232_S0	In October, 2013, we were advised that the DOJ s Criminal Frauds Section had opened an investigation of River Point Behavioral Health and Wekiva Springs Center.
352915_18_ITEM15_P232_S1	Since that time, we have been notified that the Criminal Frauds section has opened investigations of National Deaf Academy, Hartgrove Hospital and UHS as a corporate entity.
352915_18_ITEM15_P232_S2	In April 2017, the DOJ s Criminal Division issued a subpoena requesting documentation from Shadow Mountain Behavioral Health.
352915_18_ITEM15_P232_S3	In August 2017, Kempsville Center of Behavioral Health (a part of Harbor Point Behavioral Health previously identified above) received a subpoena requesting documentation.
352915_18_ITEM15_P233_S0	In April, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) instituted a Medicare payment suspension at River Point Behavioral Health in accordance with federal regulations regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P233_S1	The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration ( AHCA ) subsequently issued a Medicaid payment suspension for the facility.
352915_18_ITEM15_P233_S2	River Point Behavioral Health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension.
352915_18_ITEM15_P233_S3	Notwithstanding, CMS continued the payment suspension.
352915_18_ITEM15_P233_S4	River Point Behavioral Health provided additional information to CMS in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the Medicare suspension remains in effect.
352915_18_ITEM15_P233_S5	In June 2017, AHCA advised that while they were maintaining the suspension for dual eligible and cross-over Medicare beneficiaries, the Medicaid payment suspension was lifted effective June 27, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P233_S6	We cannot predict if and/or when the facility s remaining suspended payments will resume in total.
352915_18_ITEM15_P233_S7	From inception through December 31, 2017, the aggregate funds withheld from us in connection with the River Point Behavioral Health payment suspension amounted to approximately $10 million.
352915_18_ITEM15_P233_S8	Although the operating results of River Point Behavioral Health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2017, 2016 or 2015, the payment suspension has had a material adverse effect on the facility s results of operations and financial condition.
352915_18_ITEM15_P234_S0	The DOJ has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation referenced above is a False Claims Act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P234_S1	Based upon our initial discussions with the DOJ, our financial statements as of December 31, 2017 include a $22 million reserve established in connection with the civil aspects of these matters.
352915_18_ITEM15_P234_S2	However, changes in the reserve may be required in future periods as discussions continue and additional information becomes available.
352915_18_ITEM15_P234_S3	We cannot predict the ultimate resolution of these matters and therefore can provide no assurance that final amounts paid in settlement or otherwise, if any, or associated costs, will not differ materially from our established reserve.
352915_18_ITEM15_P235_S0	Litigation: U.S. ex rel Escobar v. Universal Health Services, Inc. et.al.
352915_18_ITEM15_P235_S1	This is a False Claims Act case filed against Universal Health Services, Inc., UHS of Delaware, Inc. and HRI Clinics, Inc.
352915_18_ITEM15_P235_S2	d/b/a Arbour Counseling Services in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
352915_18_ITEM15_P235_S3	This qui tam action primarily alleges that Arbour Counseling Services failed to appropriately supervise certain clinical providers in contravention of regulatory requirements and the submission of claims to Medicaid were subsequently improper.
352915_18_ITEM15_P235_S4	Relators make other claims of improper billing to Medicaid associated with alleged failures of Arbour Counseling to comply with state regulations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P236_S0	The U.S. Attorney s Office and the Massachusetts Attorney General s Office initially declined to intervene.
352915_18_ITEM15_P236_S1	UHS filed a motion to dismiss and the trial court originally granted the motion dismissing the case.
352915_18_ITEM15_P236_S2	The First Circuit Court of Appeals ( First Circuit ) reversed the trial court s dismissal of the case.
352915_18_ITEM15_P236_S3	The United States Supreme Court subsequently vacated the First Circuit s opinion and remanded the case for further consideration under the new legal standards established by the Supreme Court for False Claims Act cases.
352915_18_ITEM15_P236_S4	During the 4 th quarter of 2016, the First Circuit issued a revised opinion upholding their reversal of the trial court s dismissal.
352915_18_ITEM15_P236_S5	The case was then remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.
352915_18_ITEM15_P236_S6	In January 2017, the U.S. Attorney s Office and Massachusetts Attorney General s Office advised of the potential for intervention in the case.
352915_18_ITEM15_P236_S7	The Massachusetts Attorney General s Office subsequently filed its motion to intervene which was granted and, in April 2017, filed their Complaint in Intervention.
352915_18_ITEM15_P236_S8	We are defending this case vigorously.
352915_18_ITEM15_P236_S9	At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_18_ITEM15_P237_S0	In December 2016 a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against UHS, and certain UHS officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws.
352915_18_ITEM15_P237_S1	Plaintiff alleges that defendants violated federal securities laws relating to the disclosures made in public filings associated with practices at our behavioral health facilities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P238_S0	The case was originally filed as Heed v. Universal Health Services, Inc. et. al.
352915_18_ITEM15_P238_S1	The court subsequently appointed Teamsters Local 456 Pension Fund and Teamsters Local 456 Annuity Fund to serve as lead plaintiffs.
352915_18_ITEM15_P238_S2	The case has been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the style of the case has been changed to Teamsters Local 456 Pension Fund, et.
352915_18_ITEM15_P238_S3	In September, 2017, Teamsters Local 456 Pension Fund filed an amended complaint.
352915_18_ITEM15_P238_S4	In December 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
352915_18_ITEM15_P238_S5	We deny liability and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.
352915_18_ITEM15_P238_S6	At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with this matter.
352915_18_ITEM15_P239_S0	In March 2017, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by plaintiff David Heed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.
352915_18_ITEM15_P239_S1	A notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was filed (Case No. 2:17-cv-01476-LS).
352915_18_ITEM15_P239_S2	Plaintiff filed a motion to remand.
352915_18_ITEM15_P239_S3	In December 2017, the Court denied plaintiff s motion to remand and has retained the case in federal court.
352915_18_ITEM15_P240_S0	The suit alleges breaches of fiduciary duties and other allegedly wrongful conduct by the members of the Board of Directors and certain officers of Universal Health Services, Inc. relating to practices at our behavioral health facilities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P240_S1	UHS has been named as a nominal defendant in the case.
352915_18_ITEM15_P240_S2	In May, June and July 2017, additional shareholder derivative suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
352915_18_ITEM15_P240_S3	The plaintiffs in those cases are: Central Laborers Pension Fund (Case No. 17-cv-02187-LS); Firemen s Retirement System of St. Louis (Case No. 17 cv-02317-LS); Waterford Township Police Fire Retirement System (Case No. 17-cv-02595-LS); and Amalgamated Bank Longview Funds (Case No. 17-cv-03404-LS).
352915_18_ITEM15_P240_S4	The Fireman s Retirement System case has since been voluntarily dismissed.
352915_18_ITEM15_P240_S5	In addition, a shareholder derivative case was filed in Chancery Court in Delaware by the Delaware County Employees Retirement Fund (Case No. 2017-0475-JTL).
352915_18_ITEM15_P240_S6	In December 2017, the Chancery Court stayed this case pending resolution of other contemporaneous matters.
352915_18_ITEM15_P241_S0	These additional cases make substantially similar allegations and claims based upon alleged violations of federal securities laws as well common law causes of action against the individual defendants.
352915_18_ITEM15_P241_S1	All of these additional cases have also named all members of the UHS Board of Directors as well as certain officers of the Company.
352915_18_ITEM15_P241_S2	The defendants deny liability and intend to defend these cases vigorously.
352915_18_ITEM15_P241_S3	At this time, we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure, if any, which may be associated with these matters.
352915_18_ITEM15_P242_S0	Chowdary v. Universal Health Services, Inc., et.
352915_18_ITEM15_P243_S0	This is a lawsuit filed in 1999 in state court in Hidalgo County, Texas by a physician and his professional associations alleging tortious interference with contractual relationships and retaliation against McAllen Medical Center in McAllen, Texas as well as Universal Health Services, Inc.
352915_18_ITEM15_P243_S1	The state court has entered a summary judgment order awarding plaintiff $3.85 million in damages.
352915_18_ITEM15_P243_S2	With prejudgment interest, the total amount of the order amounts to approximately $9 million, for which a reserve is included in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017.
352915_18_ITEM15_P243_S3	A trial on punitive damages, emotional distress and attorneys fees remains to be conducted if the summary judgment order is not vacated.
352915_18_ITEM15_P243_S4	The case has been removed to federal court.
352915_18_ITEM15_P243_S5	Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand.
352915_18_ITEM15_P243_S6	In February 2018, the federal court denied plaintiffs motion to remand and retained the case in federal court.
352915_18_ITEM15_P243_S7	Plaintiffs have filed a writ of mandamus with the 5 th Circuit Court of Appeals seeking to overturn the federal court s decision denying remand.
352915_18_ITEM15_P243_S8	We have filed a motion for reconsideration of state court s summary judgment order in the federal court proceeding.
352915_18_ITEM15_P244_S0	Disproportionate Share Hospital Payment Matter: In late September, 2015, many hospitals in Pennsylvania, including seven of our behavioral health care hospitals located in the state, received letters from the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (the Department ) demanding repayment of allegedly excess Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments ( DSH ) for the federal fiscal year 2011 ( FFY2011 ) amounting to approximately $4 million in the aggregate.
352915_18_ITEM15_P244_S1	Since that time, we have received similar requests for repayment for alleged DSH overpayments for FFYs 2012 and 2013 aggregating to approximately $11 million.
352915_18_ITEM15_P244_S2	We filed administrative appeals for all of our facilities contesting the recoupment efforts for FFYs 2011 through 2013 as we believe the Department s calculation methodology is inaccurate and conflicts with applicable federal and state laws and regulations.
352915_18_ITEM15_P244_S3	The Department has agreed to postpone the recoupment of the state s share of the DSH payments until all hospital appeals are resolved but started recoupment of the federal share.
352915_18_ITEM15_P244_S4	The Department will likely make similar repayment demand for FFY 2014.
352915_18_ITEM15_P245_S0	Due to a change in the Pennsylvania Medicaid State Plan and implementation of a CMS-approved Medicaid Section 1115 Waiver, we do not believe the methodology applied by the Department to FFYs 2011 through 2013 is applicable to reimbursements received for Medicaid services provided after January 1, 2015 by our behavioral health care facilities located in Pennsylvania.
352915_18_ITEM15_P245_S1	We can provide no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our legal and administrative appeals related to the Department s repayment demands.
352915_18_ITEM15_P245_S2	If our legal and administrative appeals are unsuccessful, our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by these repayments.
352915_18_ITEM15_P246_S0	Matters Relating to Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. ( PSI ): The following matters pertain to PSI or former PSI facilities (owned by subsidiaries of PSI) which were in existence prior to the acquisition of PSI and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in November, 2010: Department of Justice Investigation of Riveredge Hospital In 2008, Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, Illinois received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain information from the facility.
352915_18_ITEM15_P246_S1	Additional requests for documents were also received from the DOJ in 2009 and 2010.
352915_18_ITEM15_P246_S2	The requested documents have been provided to the DOJ.
352915_18_ITEM15_P246_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_18_ITEM15_P246_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_18_ITEM15_P247_S0	Department of Justice Investigation of Friends Hospital In October, 2010, Friends Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting certain documents from the facility.
352915_18_ITEM15_P247_S1	The requested documents were collected and provided to the DOJ for review and examination.
352915_18_ITEM15_P247_S2	Another subpoena was issued to the facility in July, 2011 requesting additional documents, which have also been delivered to the DOJ.
352915_18_ITEM15_P247_S3	All documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under PSI s ownership prior to our acquisition.
352915_18_ITEM15_P247_S4	At present, we are uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facility and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.
352915_18_ITEM15_P247_S5	Other Matters: Various other suits, claims and investigations, including government subpoenas, arising against, or issued to, us are pending and additional such matters may arise in the future.
352915_18_ITEM15_P247_S6	Management will consider additional disclosure from time to time to the extent it believes such matters may be or become material.
352915_18_ITEM15_P247_S7	The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities.
352915_18_ITEM15_P247_S8	We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
352915_18_ITEM15_P247_S9	No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters described above or that are otherwise pending because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the matter is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties, or; (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.
352915_18_ITEM15_P247_S10	It is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and, potentially, our reputation.
352915_18_ITEM15_P248_S0	9) RELATIONSHIP WITH UNIVERSAL HEALTH REALTY INCOME TRUST AND OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Relationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust: At December 31, 2017, we held approximately 5.7% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the Trust ).
352915_18_ITEM15_P249_S0	In December, 2017, the advisory agreement was renewed by the Trust for 2018 pursuant to the same terms in place during each of the last three years.
352915_18_ITEM15_P249_S1	During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the advisory fee was computed at 0.70% of the Trust s average invested real estate assets.
352915_18_ITEM15_P249_S2	In addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust.
352915_18_ITEM15_P249_S3	Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.

352915_18_ITEM15_P257_S0	The non-contributory plan is a defined benefit pension plan which covers employees of one of our subsidiaries.
352915_18_ITEM15_P257_S1	The benefits are based on years of service and the employee s highest compensation for any five years of employment.
352915_18_ITEM15_P258_S0	Our funding policy is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount that should be funded in accordance with the provisions of ERISA.
352915_18_ITEM15_P259_S0	For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation , the actuarial present value, as of December 31 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date.
352915_18_ITEM15_P259_S1	The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including estimates of the average life of employees/survivors and average years of service rendered.
352915_18_ITEM15_P259_S2	It is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future compensation levels.
352915_18_ITEM15_P259_S3	The following table shows the reconciliation of the defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:
352915_18_ITEM15_P260_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plan represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation as of a certain date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels.
352915_18_ITEM15_P260_S1	The accumulated benefit obligation for our plan was $115.9 million and $110.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P260_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of plan assets exceed the accumulated benefit obligation by $2.7 million.
352915_18_ITEM15_P260_S3	As of December 31, 2016, the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $0.9 million.
352915_18_ITEM15_P261_S0	We estimate that there will be no net loss or prior service cost amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income during 2018.
352915_18_ITEM15_P262_S0	In May, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, "Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent)," which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
352915_18_ITEM15_P263_S0	The standard removes the requirement to categorize investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value (NAV) per share practical expedient within the fair value hierarchy.
352915_18_ITEM15_P263_S1	We have adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016, and applied the guidance retrospectively.
352915_18_ITEM15_P263_S2	This standard impacts financial statement disclosure only.
352915_18_ITEM15_P263_S3	In previous reporting periods, we disclosed the full fair value hierarchy and disclosed our pension assets as level 2 within the hierarchy.
352915_18_ITEM15_P263_S4	Going forward, we will disclose our pension assets by asset category reported using NAV as a practical expedient for comparative years.
352915_18_ITEM15_P263_S5	The market values of our pension plan assets at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, reported using net asset value as a practical expedient, by asset category are as follows:
352915_18_ITEM15_P264_S0	To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio.
352915_18_ITEM15_P265_S0	The following table shows expected benefit payments for the years ended December 31, 2018 through 2027 for our defined pension plan.

352915_18_ITEM15_P266_S1	The investment policy is in keeping with the fiduciary requirements under existing federal laws and managed in accordance with the Prudent Investor Rule.
