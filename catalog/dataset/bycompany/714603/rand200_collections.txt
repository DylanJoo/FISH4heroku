714603_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	On March 31, 2009, DST purchased the remaining 50% equity interest of Argus Health Systems, Inc. ("Argus") for $57.0 million in cash.
714603_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	As a result, Argus is no longer an unconsolidated affiliate of DST, but rather is a wholly owned subsidiary resulting in DST consolidating the results of Argus after March 31, 2009.

714603_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	Argus is principally engaged in the business of providing pharmacy claims processing and other related services to help clients manage pharmacy benefit programs.
714603_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	The Company believes that the acquisition of Argus complements its existing DST Health Solutions business, expands the size of its healthcare processing capabilities and will enable the Company to provide broader product offerings to new and existing customers.
714603_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	BlueDoor, based in Melbourne, Australia, provides software solutions to retirement fund management companies that perform participant accounting and funds management services for the retirement savings ("superannuation") markets in Australia.

714603_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	marketing and personalization services, fulfillment, postal optimization, and electronic presentment, payment and distribution solutions.
714603_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	These capabilities enable the Output Solutions Segment to provide services to industries that place a premium on customer communications that require high quality, accurate and timely statement and billing output processing.
714603_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	As described in Part II, Item 7 "Significant Events" the following changes have occurred in the composition of the Output Solutions Segment during the three years ended December 31, 2010:
714603_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	On July 30, 2010, DST, through its wholly-owned U.K. subsidiary, Innovative Output Solutions Limited ("IOS"), acquired dsicmm Group Limited ("dsicmm"), a provider of print/mail services in the U.K., for cash and the issuance of IOS stock.
714603_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	After completion of the transaction, DST owns 70.5% of IOS and the remaining 29.5% is owned by a group of former stockholders of dsicmm.
714603_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	DST has consolidated the financial results of the combined IOS business from the closing date and has reflected the 29.5% owned by the former stockholders of dsicmm as a non-controlling interest.
714603_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	In the second quarter of 2010, an Output Solutions telecommunications client, representing approximately 6.6% of 2009 annual Output Solutions Segment operating revenues, terminated its contract and internalized its bill production.
714603_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	The termination occurred on April 30, 2010 and resulted in a contract termination payment to the Company of approximately $63.0 million.
714603_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Output Solutions Segment conducts its operations from four operating facilities located throughout North America and six operating facilities located throughout the U.K. DST Output is among the largest users of continuous, high-speed, full-color inkjet printing systems and among the largest First-class mailers in the U.S.

714603_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Output Solutions Segment's research and development efforts have resulted in two mail and postal processing initiatives, Smart Commingling and Intelligent Mail barcode, in compliance with United States Postal Services requirements.
714603_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	In addition, the Digital Press Technology ("DPT") high-speed color printing and inserting platform enables the Output Solutions Segment to produce high-speed transactional printing combined with dynamic color printing.
714603_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	DST Output believes DPT is a technologically-differentiated service offering that enables them to provide better and more efficient products and services to clients.
714603_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Output Solutions Segment in North America distributes its product directly to clients and through relationships in which its services are combined with or offered concurrently through providers of data processing services.
714603_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	The Output Solutions Segment's products are also distributed or bundled with product offerings to clients of the Financial Services Segment.
714603_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Investments and Other Segment is comprised of the Company's real estate subsidiaries and affiliates and joint ventures, investments in equity securities, private equity investments and other financial interests.

714603_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Company owns and operates real estate mostly in the U.S. and U.K., primarily for lease to the Company's other business segments.
714603_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Company is a partner in certain real estate joint ventures that lease office space to the Company, certain of its unconsolidated affiliates and unrelated third parties.

714603_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	(1) Includes operating revenues of Argus Health Systems, Inc. from the acquisition date of March 31, 2009.
714603_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	(2) Principally postage and telecommunication expenditures, which are reimbursed by the customer.
714603_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	(3) Processed by International Financial Data Services (U.K.) Limited, an unconsolidated affiliate of the Company.
714603_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	(4) Processed by International Financial Data Services L.P., an unconsolidated affiliate of the Company comprised of businesses in Canada, Ireland and Luxembourg.
714603_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	DST's U.S. Investment Recordkeeping Solutions is comprised the following four product offerings:
714603_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	The shareowner recordkeeping systems and services support open and closed-end mutual funds, Real Estate Investment Trusts ("REITs"), and various forms of tax advantaged savings vehicles.
714603_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	Included in tax-advantaged accounts are Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRAs"), and Educational Savings Plan Accounts, which encompass both Coverdell and Section 529 college savings plan accounts.
714603_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Most of the Company's clients who utilize the shareowner recordkeeping platform are "open-end" mutual fund companies, which obtain funds for investment by making a continuous offering of their shares.
714603_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	The proprietary system application for shareowner recordkeeping is TA2000.
714603_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	TA2000 handles virtually all shareowner related activities including purchases, redemptions, exchanges and transfers of shares; maintaining shareowner identification and share ownership records; reconciling cash and share activity; calculating and disbursing commissions to brokers and other distributors; processing dividends; reporting sales; and providing information for printing of shareowner trade confirmations, statements and year-end tax forms.
714603_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	The system processes multiple classes of equity, fixed income and money market funds.
714603_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Shareowner recordkeeping services are offered on a full, remote and shared service basis.
714603_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	Selection by a client of the type of service is influenced by a number of factors, including cost and level of desired control over interaction with fund shareowners or distributors.
714603_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	"Full" service processing or "BPO" (Business Process Outsourcing) includes all necessary administrative and clerical support to process and maintain shareowner records, reconciling cash and share activity, answering inquiries from shareowners, brokers and others, and handling the TA2000 processing functions described above.
714603_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	In addition, full service mutual fund transfer agency clients may elect to have their end of day available client bank balances invested overnight by and in the name of the Company into credit-quality money market funds or other similar overnight investment alternatives.
714603_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	"Remote" service processing, or "ASP" (Application Service Provider), is designed to enable mutual fund management companies acting as their own transfer agent, and third party transfer agents that have their own administrative and clerical staff access to TA2000 at the Company's data processing facilities, using the Company's data communications network.
714603_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	"Shared" service processing enables clients to select the administrative functions to be handled by both client personnel and the Company.
714603_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	This service is facilitated by the use of "AWD" (Automated Work Distributor), DST's own business process management and customer contact system.
714603_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	The Company derives revenues from its shareowner recordkeeping services through use of the Company's proprietary software systems to provide such services, clerical processing services and other related products.
714603_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	Fees are generally charged based on a per account and number of funds basis for system processing services and on a per account, number of funds and transaction basis for clerical services.
714603_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	In limited instances, the Company has asset based fee arrangements.
714603_11_ITEM1_P37_S3	The Company's policy is not to license TA2000.
714603_11_ITEM1_P37_S4	The Company also derives revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in the Company's full service, transfer agency bank accounts.
714603_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Investor attraction to a wide array of mutual fund investment products with increasingly specialized features has increased the number of mutual fund shareowner accounts, the volume of transactions and the complexity of recordkeeping.
714603_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	In addition, new technologies have changed the service requirements and distribution channels of the mutual fund market.
714603_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	The Company has made significant investments in computer capacities and systems functionality to handle the increasing marketplace demands in order to maintain its market position and to improve quality and productivity.
714603_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	A majority of the shareowner accounts serviced by the Company are at organizations that have been clients of the Company for more than five years.
714603_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	This distinguishes these accounts from broker subaccounts, which are serviced under contract with a broker/dealer.
714603_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	Registered accounts include both tax-advantaged and non tax-advantaged accounts on the books of the transfer agent.
714603_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company provided shareowner recordkeeping services for approximately 113.7 million shareowner accounts (registered and subaccounts), a decrease of 7.4 million accounts or 6.1% since December 31, 2009.
714603_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	Registered accounts (both tax advantaged and non-tax advantaged accounts) serviced were 99.4 million at December 31, 2010, a decrease of 10.5 million or 9.6% as compared to December 31, 2009.
714603_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	At December 31, 2010, 44.6 million of the registered accounts were tax advantaged.
714603_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	DST serviced 25.5 million IRAs invested in mutual funds and 9.7 million accounts in an assortment of retirement accounts (SAR-SEP, Keogh and SIMPLEs).
714603_11_ITEM1_P43_S2	In addition, DST supported 9.4 million educational savings accounts, of which 8.6 million are Section 529 plan accounts.
714603_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	The Company provides mutual fund shareowner recordkeeping services to brokerage firms who perform transfer agent functions in a subaccounting arrangement for mutual fund accounts that have been sold by the broker/dealer's financial advisors.
714603_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	The Company offers subaccounting services to broker/dealers on both a remote (ASP) and full service (BPO) basis.
714603_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	A broker/dealer providing subaccounting services may provide these services to multiple fund companies.
714603_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	In 2002, the Company enhanced TA2000 to meet the complex reconciliation and system interfaces required by broker/dealers.
714603_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	The Company believes using the same core processing functionality for both transfer agency shareowner recordkeeping (registered accounts) and subaccounting should further the clients' objectives of consistent accounting for shareowner positions, since the recordkeeping is done by one system TA2000.
714603_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	On July 31, 2007, DST acquired TASS.
714603_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	TASS provides subaccounting services on a full service basis to the broker/dealer industry.
714603_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	TASS uses the TA2000 subaccounting platform ("TA2000 Subaccounting") to perform these services for its customers.
714603_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	Revenues for subaccounting services are generally based on the number of subaccounts serviced, and, because of the level of services provided directly by the broker/dealer, fewer of TA2000's features are required.
714603_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	This results in per account revenue for subaccounts being less than what the Company derives from its mutual fund shareowner processing services for registered accounts.
714603_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	Subaccounts serviced by the Company were 14.3 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of 3.1 million from December 31, 2009.
714603_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Company offers TRAC on a full-service (BPO) and remote (ASP) basis.
714603_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	The Company believes the defined contribution market is a significant growth opportunity for its services and products because (i) that market continues to experience significant expansion as more employers shift away from defined benefit programs, (ii) the federal government has policies that encourage, and the retirement industry has a strong desire to expand, coverage to include the estimated 78 million Americans not participating in a retirement savings program today, and (iii) potential participation is likely to increase as retirement plan sponsors adopt auto enrollment and guaranteed income features for new employees.
714603_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	In 2008, DST formed DST Retirement Solutions LLC ("DSTRS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of DST, to help meet the needs of defined contribution service providers.
714603_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	The new entity combines the Company's TRAC technology solution with Boston Financial Data Services, Inc.'s ("BFDS") defined contribution full service plan administration and recordkeeping unit.
714603_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	From application service provider ("ASP") to business process outsourcing ("BPO"), DSTRS offers a variety of selective outsourcing options, including front- and back-office technology solutions for financial service organizations offering retirement plan recordkeeping for plans of any size.
714603_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	As of December 31, 2010, DSTRS serviced 4.5 million plan participants on the TRAC platform, an increase of 0.3 million from December 31, 2009.
714603_11_ITEM1_P52_S2	Revenues from these services are primarily based on the number of participants in the defined contribution plans.
714603_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	The Company offers products designed to assist clients in meeting the expanding needs associated with distributing U.S. investment products through financial intermediaries.
714603_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	The array of solutions supporting distribution of investment products is expanding to address regulatory, service, and information needs of the financial service industry.
714603_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	DST Vision is an aggregating Web site designed exclusively for financial advisors and broker/dealer back-office operations.
714603_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	The site enables mutual fund companies, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and variable annuity companies to reduce operational expense by replacing costly support phone calls from intermediaries with Web-based self-servicing.
714603_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	Providing over 120,000 financial advisors access to more than 300 participating investment product manufacturers, Vision is an industry leading source of customer information.
714603_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	Having access to consolidated account information across all of an investor's product relationships provides significant customer support efficiencies to the financial intermediaries' operations.
714603_11_ITEM1_P55_S2	Advisors can also utilize portfolio management tools, access electronic shareholder statements, and initiate transaction processing.
714603_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	All Vision charges are paid by the product companies through a combination of user access charges and activity related fees.
714603_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	Beginning in 2010, the Company began providing additional services to advisors affiliated with independent broker/dealers.
714603_11_ITEM1_P56_S2	Through a new offering called Vision Professional, advisors have access to presentation ready, automated and consolidated quarter-end shareholder reporting with supplemental product and holdings analytics.
714603_11_ITEM1_P56_S3	The fees are paid by the advisors under a subscription service.
714603_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	FAN Mail (Financial Advisor Network) is a centralized data delivery source for investor account detail from mutual fund, variable annuity, and Real Estate Investment Trusts companies.
714603_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	FAN Mail provides advisors and broker/dealer back-offices the transactional and position information necessary to populate proprietary data-bases and software applications.
714603_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	Daily automated downloads streamline back-office administrative tasks, reporting, and compliance oversight.
714603_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	FAN Mail is compatible with the industries' most popular portfolio management and compliance software applications.
714603_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	of investor account detail and transactional information.
714603_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	All FAN Mail charges are paid by the product companies based on the volume of account and transaction records delivered to the underlying intermediary.
714603_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	While Vision and FAN Mail largely service the same audience, there are distinct reasons an intermediary would use one or both products.
714603_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	Vision, as a web site, is designed to provide a real-time view of the underlying recordkeeping detail and is frequently used to resolve operations based servicing issues or to execute transactions or account maintenance.
714603_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	FAN Mail is used by intermediaries that need to take possession of the data to source proprietary software applications.
714603_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	Consequently, almost all FAN Mail users also use Vision.
714603_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	Omnibus Transparency offers a solution that provides mutual fund companies the ability to request and receive supplemental trade data from intermediaries for compliance with Rule 22c-2 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
714603_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	Clients use these tools to perform their oversight obligations relative to subaccounts not held on the Funds' recordkeeping platform.
714603_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	Features include data storage structure, and analytics/reporting for market timing, and best pricing of trades.
714603_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Revenues from Omnibus Transparency are based generally on the number of transactions or positions requested and analyzed.
714603_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	SalesConnect assists fund companies with identifying and servicing the financial intermediaries that distribute the client's investment products.
714603_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	SalesConnect combines sales reporting and client relationship management software with a trade resolution and data management service.

714603_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	Revenues from SalesConnect are based generally on the number of transactions, positions, and affiliated advisors.
714603_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	BFDS, a 50% owned joint venture with State Street, is an important distribution channel for the Company's services and products.
714603_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	BFDS combines use of the Company's proprietary applications and output solutions capabilities with the marketing capabilities and custodial services of State Street to provide full-service and shared-service shareowner recordkeeping to approximately 111 U.S. mutual fund companies.
714603_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	BFDS also offers settlement administration services, full service proxy solutions, teleservicing and full-service support for defined contribution plans using the Company's TRAC system, and provides REIT participant accounting services.

714603_11_ITEM1_P169_S4	In addition, some competitors own mail order facilities which enables them to earn spread revenue on the drug transaction and may result in conflicts in objectives of the servicer to drive members to mail order vs. objectives of the customer to offer more competitive rates for other alternatives, such as 90 day at retail.

714603_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Prior to closing the transaction, IOS held DST's debt-free U.K. print/mail operations.
714603_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	After completion of the transaction, DST owns approximately 70.5% of IOS and the remaining 29.5% is owned by a group of the former stockholders of dsicmm.
714603_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	DST has consolidated the financial results of the combined IOS business from the closing date and has reflected the 29.5% owned by former stockholders of dsicmm as a non-controlling interest.
714603_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	dsicmm provides integrated print and communication solutions in the U.K. DST believes that the acquisition of dsicmm complements its existing Output Solutions business in the U.K., increases the overall size of the business, broadens the service/product offerings and expands and diversifies the client base.
714603_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Company has not yet finalized its accounting for the acquired assets of dsicmm; when finalized, it is possible that net assets acquired will be adjusted.
714603_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	DST has preliminarily recognized identifiable intangible assets (comprised of customer relationships of $11.0 million and proprietary software of $4.7 million) and goodwill, resulting from the acquisition.
714603_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	DST estimates annual amortization for acquired dsicmm intangible assets will be approximately $2.4 million.
714603_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	An Output Solutions telecommunications client, representing approximately 6.6% of 2009 annual Output Solutions Segment operating revenues, terminated its contract and internalized its bill production processing on April 30, 2010.
714603_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	DST received a contract termination payment of approximately $63.0 million in connection with this termination.
714603_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	During 2010, the Company entered into a new $600 million revolving credit agreement in April and renewed and increased its revolving promissory note with BFDS from $100 million to $140 million in October.
714603_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Both of these revolving credit facilities mature on July 1, 2013.
714603_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	In August, the Company issued $370 million of Senior Notes with a weighted average interest rate and life of 5.06% and 8.25 years, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	After issuing the Senior Notes, the Company called and redeemed the Series A and Series B senior convertible debentures, fully retiring these series of debentures.
714603_11_ITEM7_P13_S4	During 2010, the Company paid $498.5 million to repurchase or redeem Series A, B and C senior convertible debentures.

714603_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Acquisition of Argus Health Systems, Inc.
714603_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Prior to March 31, 2009, DST owned a 50% equity interest in Argus, which provides pharmacy claims processing and other related services to help clients manage pharmacy benefit programs.
714603_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	On March 31, 2009, DST purchased the remaining 50% interest of Argus for $57.0 million in cash.
714603_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result, Argus is no longer an unconsolidated affiliate, but rather is a wholly owned subsidiary resulting in DST consolidating the results of Argus after March 31, 2009 rather than recording equity in earnings of Argus.
714603_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	The acquisition of the remaining 50% of Argus was treated as a step acquisition.
714603_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	Accordingly, DST remeasured its previously held equity interest in Argus to fair value, in the amount of $57.0 million, and recorded a gain of $41.7 million, which is included in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_11_ITEM7_P16_S5	DST has recognized identifiable assets (comprised of proprietary software of $26.0 million, customer relationships of $14.0 million and other intangible assets of $1.0 million) and goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the remaining 50% Argus interest and the remeasurement of its previously held equity interest.
714603_11_ITEM7_P16_S6	Based on the purchase price allocation, DST estimates that annual amortization expense from Argus acquired intangible assets will be approximately $4.2 million.
714603_11_ITEM7_P16_S7	The Company believes that the acquisition of Argus complements its existing DST Health Solutions business, increases the size of its healthcare processing capabilities and will enable the Company to provide broader product offerings to new and existing customers.
714603_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	On November 14, 2008, DST completed the acquisition of BlueDoor Technologies Pty Ltd ("BlueDoor"), which provides software solutions for participant accounting for the funds management and retirement savings ("superannuation") markets in Australia.
714603_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the consideration paid for BlueDoor on the acquisition date consisted of approximately $10.3 million of cash and 85,006 shares of DST common stock at an approximate value of $3.1 million.
714603_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	DST believes the expansion of its software solution offerings will provide broader product offerings to existing and new customers.
714603_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	On January 29, 2010, DST implemented a plan to reduce its workforce during 2010.
714603_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	This plan was necessitated by the extended economic downturn which negatively impacted the financial services industry.
714603_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	The plan resulted in a reduction of approximately 7% of the employee workforce, affecting all DST domestic and international business units.
714603_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	As a result of this workforce reduction, the Company incurred a pre-tax charge in 2010 of approximately $20.9 million in connection with its payment of related termination benefits.
714603_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	The plan was completed in December 2010.
714603_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.
714603_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company believes that its guarantee arrangements will not have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures, capital resources, liquidity or results of operations.
714603_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	These arrangements are described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
714603_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	In January 2009, the Company entered an interest rate swap with a bank to fix the interest rate on its syndicated real estate credit agreement at approximately 4.49% (includes 1.75% applicable margin rate) beginning January 2010.
714603_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	This interest rate swap qualifies as a derivative instrument.
714603_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company's interest rate swap is a cash flow hedge of future interest payments under the Company's real estate credit agreement and uses a pay-fixed, receive-variable, forward starting interest rate swap.
714603_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking this hedge is to eliminate the variability of interest cash flows related to the Company's floating-rate real estate credit agreement.
714603_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Changes in the cash flows of the interest rate swap are expected to offset the changes in cash flows attributable to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR benchmark interest rate.
714603_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	The derivative instrument is a receive floating, pay 2.74% fixed, forward starting interest rate swap with an effective date of January 4, 2010 and a maturity date of September 16, 2013.
714603_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Effectiveness of the hedge relationship is assessed on a quarterly basis both prospectively and retrospectively using the "cumulative dollar offset" method, in which the cumulative changes in the value of the hedging instrument are directly compared with the cumulative change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
714603_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	A dollar offset ratio of between 0.80 and 1.25 is required in order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
714603_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	At inception of the hedge, the cumulative dollar offset ratio is 1.00 since the terms of the perfect hypothetical swap match those of the actual swap.
714603_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	The derivative accounting guidance indicates that hedge effectiveness occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows of the hedged transaction.
714603_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of the Company's pay-fixed, receive-variable, forward starting interest rate swap was a liability of $5.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively, which is included in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company determined there was no ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, which resulted in the changes in fair value of this swap being recorded in other comprehensive income.
714603_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Accounting and reporting guidance for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value, and that the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
714603_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company may have obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	In the operations of its businesses, the Company's financial results can be affected by changes in equity pricing, interest rates and currency exchange rates.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Changes in interest rates and exchange rates have not materially impacted the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow of the Company.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Changes in equity values of the Company's investments have had a material effect on the Company's comprehensive income and financial position.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company's investments in available-for-sale equity securities are subject to price risk.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The fair value of the Company's available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2010 was approximately $905.8 million.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The impact of a 10% change in fair value of these investments would be approximately $55.5 million to comprehensive income.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	As discussed under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Comprehensive Income" above, net unrealized gains and losses on the Company's investments in available-for-sale securities have had a material effect on the Company's comprehensive income (loss) and financial position.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company and certain of its joint ventures derive a certain amount of their service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which the Company is the agent for clients.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The balances maintained in the bank accounts are subject to fluctuation.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company and BFDS had average daily cash balances of approximately $1.5 billion maintained in such accounts, of which approximately $1.0 billion were maintained at BFDS.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The Company estimates that a 50 basis point change in interest earnings rate would equal approximately $2.4 million of net income (loss).
714603_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company had $1.2 billion of debt, of which $598.9 million was subject to variable interest rates (Federal Funds rates, LIBOR rates, Prime rates).
714603_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	As discussed above in comprehensive income (loss), the amount recorded related to the Company's proportional share of unconsolidated affiliates' interest rate swap was a loss of $2.0 million.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The Company estimates that a 10% increase in interest rates would not be material to the Company's consolidated pretax earnings or to the fair value of its debt.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In addition to the financial instruments listed above, the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under the Company's accounts receivable securitization program are determined based on variable interest rates associated with LIBOR.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The operation of the Company's subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The principal currencies involved are the British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Thai baht and Indian rupee.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Currency exchange rate fluctuations have not historically materially affected the consolidated financial results of the Company.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company's international subsidiaries had approximately $290.6 million in total assets and for the year ended December 31, 2010, these international subsidiaries produced approximately $10.6 million in net income.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The Company estimates that a 10% change in exchange rates could change total consolidated assets by approximately $29.1 million.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Furthermore, a 10% change in exchange rates based upon historical earnings in international operations could change consolidated reported net income for 2010 by approximately $1.1 million.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The Company's international subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The Company translates its assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates except for those accounts where historical rates are acceptable, and translates income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
714603_11_ITEM7A_P9_S2	While it is generally not the Company's practice to enter into derivative contracts, from time to time the Company and its subsidiaries do utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of currency movements.

714603_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DST Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

714603_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

714603_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
714603_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

714603_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Under authoritative accounting guidance, a reporting entity must consolidate any entity in which it has a controlling financial interest.
714603_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	Under the voting interest model, generally the investor that has voting control (usually more than 50% of an entity's voting interests) consolidates the entity.
714603_11_ITEM8_P23_S2	Under the variable interest entity ("VIE") model, as amended, the party that has the power to direct the entity's most significant economic activities and the ability to participate in the entity's economics consolidates the entity.
714603_11_ITEM8_P23_S3	This party could be an equity investor, some other capital provider, or a party with contractual arrangements.
714603_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	To determine which accounting model applies, and which, if any, party must consolidate a particular entity, a reporting entity must first determine whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a VIE.
714603_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	The term VIE applies to entities that are subject to the risk and rewards model.
714603_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	An entity is considered a VIE if it possesses one of the following characteristics: 1) the entity is thinly capitalized; 2) residual equity holders do not control the entity; 3) equity holders are shielded from economic losses; 4) equity holders do not participate fully in an entity's residual economics; and 5) the entity was established with non-substantive voting interests.
714603_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is the primary beneficiary of that entity.
714603_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	A party consolidates a VIE when that party has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the party with a controlling financial interest.
714603_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	interest if it meets both of the following criteria: 1) power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and 2) obligation to absorb losses from or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
714603_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	With regard to real estate, the Company is the lessee in a series of operating leases covering a large portion of its Kansas City based leased office facilities.
714603_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	The lessors are generally joint ventures (in which the Company has a 50% ownership) that have been established specifically to purchase, finance and engage in leasing activities with the joint venture partners and unrelated third parties.
714603_11_ITEM8_P28_S2	A company is generally not the primary beneficiary of the joint ventures if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed price purchase options or similar features that disproportionately obligate a company to absorb decreases in value or entitle it to participate in increases in the value of the real estate.
714603_11_ITEM8_P28_S3	The Company's analyses of its real estate joint ventures at December 31, 2010 indicate that none qualifies as a VIE and, accordingly, have not been consolidated.
714603_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	With regard to operating joint ventures, the Company has formed or entered into operating joint ventures to enter into or expand its presence in target markets.
714603_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company has the following significant operating joint ventures: Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. ("BFDS"); International Financial Data Services, U.K. ("IFDS U.K."); and International Financial Data Services, L.P. ("IFDS L.P.").
714603_11_ITEM8_P29_S2	Each of these operating joint ventures was formed prior to February 1, 2003.
714603_11_ITEM8_P29_S3	The Company's analyses of these operating joint ventures indicate that none qualifies as a variable interest entity in accordance with the operating joint venture exception in the accounting guidance.
714603_11_ITEM8_P29_S4	Accordingly, the Company accounts for the operating results of these operating joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.
714603_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
714603_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.

714603_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	If there is a customer acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until the Company has evidence of customer acceptance.
714603_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis; 2) there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item(s); and 3) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control of the Company.
714603_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit based on the unit's proportion of the fair value of all the units in the arrangement.
714603_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	In cases where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item(s) in an arrangement but no such evidence for the delivered item(s), the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration.
714603_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	For units of accounting which include more than one deliverable, the Company generally defers all revenue for the unit of accounting until the period over which the last undelivered item is delivered.
714603_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	Deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company recognizes revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectability has been assured.
714603_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Authoritative accounting guidance related to the income statement characterization of reimbursements received for "out-of-pocket" ("OOP") expenses incurred, requires the Company to record reimbursements received for OOP expenses as revenue on an accrual basis.
714603_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	Because these additional revenues are offset by the reimbursable expenses incurred, it does not impact income from operations or net income.
714603_11_ITEM8_P38_S2	The Company's significant OOP expenses at the consolidated level include postage and telecommunication expenditures and at the segment level include print mail services between the Financial Services Segment and the Output Solutions Segment.
714603_11_ITEM8_P38_S3	For each segment, total revenues are reported in two categories, operating revenues and OOP reimbursements.

714603_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	These costs, which the Company believes to be immaterial, are also included in costs and expenses.
714603_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	Substantially all depreciation and amortization is directly associated with the production of revenues.
714603_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized over the estimated economic lives of three to five years.

714603_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	Basic earnings per share are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	Dilutive earnings per share are determined by including the dilutive effect of all potential common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_11_ITEM8_P71_S2	The Company issued convertible senior debentures (see Note 8) that if converted in the future would have a potentially dilutive effect on the Company's stock.
714603_11_ITEM8_P71_S3	The Company intends to settle any conversions with cash for the principal and accrued and unpaid interest and issue common stock for any conversion value amount over the principal and accrued and unpaid interest amounts.
714603_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	Under authoritative accounting guidance related to earnings per share, a company is required to include the effects of contingently convertible bonds in diluted earnings per share from the date of issuance, without considering the impact of the conversion price.
714603_11_ITEM8_P72_S1	Related to the Company's convertible debentures, the calculation of diluted earnings per share includes an incremental amount of shares assumed to be issued for the conversion spread when the Company's average daily stock price exceeds the average accreted bond price per share.
714603_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	Authoritative accounting guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities.
714603_11_ITEM8_P73_S1	It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value and that the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
714603_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	it is generally not the Company's practice to enter into derivative contracts, from time to time, the Company utilizes derivatives to manage certain risks.

714603_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	During 2009, the Company entered a forward starting interest rate swap related to its real estate credit agreement as further described in Note 8.
714603_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company's comprehensive income consists of net income and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, net of deferred income taxes, reclassifications for net gains included in net income, the Company's proportional share of an unconsolidated affiliate's interest rate swap (except the loss is limited by the carrying value of the investment), unrealized losses on the Company's interest rate swap and foreign currency translation adjustments and are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
714603_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	The Company has share-based compensation plans covering its employees and its non-employee directors and has outstanding share awards (primarily in the form of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units) under each of these plans.
714603_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.
714603_11_ITEM8_P76_S2	The Company estimates compensation costs related to awards that are not expected to vest.
714603_11_ITEM8_P76_S3	For share-based awards granted, the Company expenses the grant date fair value of these awards using the straight-line method over the service period.
714603_11_ITEM8_P76_S4	Amortization for the grant date fair value of share-based awards containing both service and performance features depends on the Company's estimated judgments on whether the performance conditions will be achieved.
714603_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance related to multiple element revenue arrangements.
714603_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	This update provides guidance on whether multiple elements (deliverables) exist, how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated.
714603_11_ITEM8_P77_S2	The new guidance established a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
714603_11_ITEM8_P77_S3	The guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
714603_11_ITEM8_P77_S4	The Company has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of this new accounting guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements.
714603_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance related to certain revenue arrangements that include software elements.
714603_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	This new guidance changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements and also provides guidance on how consideration should be allocated in an arrangement that includes both tangible products and software.
714603_11_ITEM8_P78_S2	The new authoritative accounting guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
714603_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of this new accounting guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements.
714603_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	In August 2008, the FASB issued a revised exposure draft, that would amend current earnings per share accounting guidance to clarify guidance for mandatorily convertible instruments, the treasury stock method, contingently issuable shares, and contracts that may be settled in cash or shares.
714603_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	The final authoritative accounting guidance has yet to be issued.
714603_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	In April 2009, the FASB decided to pause the earnings per share project.
714603_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	The proposed guidance, which is designed for convergence with international accounting standards, would require the use of the "if-converted" method from the date of issuance of the convertible debentures.
714603_11_ITEM8_P82_S1	The proposed guidance would remove the ability of a company to support the presumption that the convertible securities will be satisfied in cash and not converted into shares of common stock.
714603_11_ITEM8_P82_S2	Accordingly, the Company's stated intention to settle conversions of its convertible debentures with cash for the principal and accrued and unpaid interest and issue common stock for any conversion value amount over the principal and accrued and unpaid interest amounts would no longer be accepted under the current guidance, if amended as proposed.
714603_11_ITEM8_P82_S3	Retrospective application would be required for all changes, except that retrospective application would be prohibited for contracts that were either settled in cash prior to adoption or modified prior to adoption to require cash settlement.
714603_11_ITEM8_P82_S4	For DST, adoption of this accounting guidance, as proposed, will require retroactive restatement of the Company's diluted earnings per share calculations subsequent to the issuance of the convertible debentures.
714603_11_ITEM8_P82_S5	The revised exposure draft also contains other EPS computational changes (e.g., treasury stock method considerations) that may have an effect on the Company's diluted earnings per share calculation.
714603_11_ITEM8_P82_S6	DST is continuing to monitor the FASB's progress towards finalizing this proposed accounting guidance.
714603_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	The proposed change in accounting principle would affect the calculation of diluted earnings per share during the period the debentures are outstanding, but would not affect DST's ability to ultimately settle the convertible debentures in cash, shares or any combination thereof.
714603_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	On July 30, 2010, DST, through its wholly-owned U.K. subsidiary, Innovative Output Solutions Limited ("IOS"), acquired dsicmm Group Limited ("dsicmm") for cash and the issuance of IOS stock.
714603_11_ITEM8_P84_S1	Prior to closing the transaction, IOS held DST's debt-free U.K. print/mail operations.
714603_11_ITEM8_P84_S2	After completion of the transaction, DST owns approximately 70.5% of IOS and the remaining 29.5% is owned by a group of the former stockholders of dsicmm.
714603_11_ITEM8_P84_S3	DST has consolidated the financial results of the combined IOS business from the closing date and has reflected the 29.5% owned by former stockholders of dsicmm as a non-controlling interest.
714603_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	dsicmm provides integrated print and communication solutions in the U.K. dsicmm has approximately 1,200 employees and recorded operating revenues of approximately $44.1 million and a loss from operations of $5.1 million during the period August 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010.
714603_11_ITEM8_P85_S1	DST believes that the acquisition of dsicmm complements its existing Output Solutions business in the U.K., increases the overall size of the business, broadens the service/product offerings and expands and diversifies the client base.
714603_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company has not yet finalized its accounting for the acquired assets of dsicmm; when finalized, it is possible that amounts appearing in the table below of net assets acquired will be adjusted.

714603_11_ITEM8_P86_S2	DST estimates annual amortization for acquired dsicmm intangible assets will be approximately $2.4 million.
714603_11_ITEM8_P86_S3	Goodwill of $42.1 million from the acquisition is comprised of the assembled workforce of dsicmm and other assets and is included in the Output Solutions Segment.
714603_11_ITEM8_P86_S4	None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
714603_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	Assuming the acquisition of dsicmm Group Limited had occurred January 1, 2009, the Company's total revenues would have been approximately $2,418.3 million and $2,359.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P87_S1	Consolidated pro forma net income and diluted earnings per share would not have been materially different from the reported amounts for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
714603_11_ITEM8_P87_S2	The unaudited pro forma amounts are not indicative of what actual consolidated results of operations might have been if the acquisition had been effective at the beginning of 2009.
714603_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	The following table summarizes the consideration for dsicmm and the preliminary allocation of the fair value of dsicmm to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at July 30, 2010 (in millions).

714603_11_ITEM8_P90_S1	On March 31, 2009, DST purchased the remaining 50% interest of Argus for $57.0 million in cash.
714603_11_ITEM8_P90_S2	As a result, Argus is no longer an unconsolidated affiliate of DST, but rather is a wholly owned subsidiary resulting in DST consolidating the results of Argus after March 31, 2009 rather than recording equity in earnings of Argus.
714603_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	On January 1, 2009 and as required by generally accepted accounting principles, the Company adopted new authoritative accounting guidance for business combinations.
714603_11_ITEM8_P91_S1	In accordance with the guidance, the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Argus was treated as a step acquisition.
714603_11_ITEM8_P91_S2	Accordingly, DST remeasured its previously held equity interest in Argus to fair value, in the amount of $57.0 million, and recorded a gain of $41.7 million on March 31, 2009, which is included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_11_ITEM8_P91_S3	DST has recognized identifiable assets (comprised of proprietary software of $26.0 million, customer relationships of $14.0 million and other intangible assets of $1.0 million) and goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the remaining 50% Argus interest and the remeasurement of DST's previously held equity interest.
714603_11_ITEM8_P91_S4	Based on the purchase price allocation, DST estimates that annual amortization expense from acquired Argus intangible assets will be approximately $4.2 million.

714603_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	Argus recorded revenues of approximately $127.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008.
714603_11_ITEM8_P93_S1	Assuming the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Argus had occurred on January 1, 2008, the Company's total revenues would have been $2,236.7 million and $2,387.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P93_S2	Consolidated pro forma net income and diluted earnings per share would not have been materially different from the reported amounts for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
714603_11_ITEM8_P93_S3	The unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what actual consolidated results of operations might have been if the acquisition had been effective as of January 1, 2008.

714603_11_ITEM8_P95_S2	The acquisition of BlueDoor did not have a material impact on the Financial Services Segment or consolidated financial results of DST during the year ended December 31, 2008.
714603_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	DST believes the expansion of its software solution offerings will provide broader product offerings to existing and new customers.
714603_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	There are provisions in the BlueDoor acquisition agreement that allow for additional consideration to be paid if license and service fee revenue targets are achieved and upon the completion of future service by the former owners of BlueDoor.

714603_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	DST has allocated the total purchase price for BlueDoor to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition.
714603_11_ITEM8_P99_S1	The initial $13.4 million purchase price allocation resulted in approximately $10.3 million of proprietary software, $0.7 million of customer relationship intangible assets, $7.2 million of goodwill, and $4.8 million of net liabilities assumed.

714603_11_ITEM8_P126_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company held certain investment assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
714603_11_ITEM8_P126_S1	These investments include the Company's available-for-sale equity securities and trading securities whereby fair value is determined using quoted prices in active markets.
714603_11_ITEM8_P126_S2	Accordingly, the fair value measurements of these investments have been classified as Level 1 in the table below.
714603_11_ITEM8_P127_S0	Included in funds held on behalf of clients at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are approximately $20.2 million and $11.1 million, respectively, of available-for-sale fixed income securities held to satisfy client funds obligations.
714603_11_ITEM8_P127_S1	The Company also owns $35.2 million and $4.4 million of other available-for-sale fixed income securities at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P127_S2	In addition, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap in January 2009 that is required to be reported at fair value.
714603_11_ITEM8_P127_S3	Fair value for the available-for-sale fixed income securities and for the interest rate swap was determined using inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other observable inputs directly or indirectly.
714603_11_ITEM8_P127_S4	Accordingly, these investments have been classified as Level 2 in the table below.
714603_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	The following tables present assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):
714603_11_ITEM8_P129_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, one of DST's unconsolidated affiliates had an interest rate swap with a fair market value liability of $47.7 million and $35.6 million, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P129_S1	The unconsolidated affiliate used inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other observable inputs directly or indirectly related to the measurement of the interest rate swap.
714603_11_ITEM8_P129_S2	The fair value measurement of the interest rate swap has been classified as Level 2 by the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_11_ITEM8_P129_S3	The above table presents only assets and liabilities measured at fair value for which the Company controls, and accordingly excludes items held by unconsolidated affiliates.
714603_11_ITEM8_P130_S0	Properties and related accumulated depreciation are as follows (in millions):
714603_11_ITEM8_P131_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were approximately $8.1 million and $8.9 million of net properties, respectively, which are included in the above table, under lease with a municipality.
714603_11_ITEM8_P131_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there was approximately $5.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively, of assets (primarily buildings) under capital lease, net of accumulated depreciation, included in the above table.
714603_11_ITEM8_P132_S0	Included in data processing software is $26.0 million of proprietary software acquired in the March 2009 acquisition of Argus and $4.7 million acquired in the July 2010 acquisition of dsicmm Group Limited.
714603_11_ITEM8_P132_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the net book value of this acquired software was $24.4 million and $23.6 million, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P133_S0	Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, was $127.5 million, $123.7 million and $119.7 million, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P134_S0	The following tables summarize the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, by Segment (in millions):
714603_11_ITEM8_P135_S0	The following table summarizes intangible assets (in millions):
714603_11_ITEM8_P136_S0	As described in Note 3, the acquisition of dsicmm Group Limited on July 30, 2010 resulted in $42.1 million in goodwill, $11.0 million in customer relationship intangible assets and $4.7 million in proprietary software (which has been included in properties).
714603_11_ITEM8_P136_S1	Also described in Note 3 is the purchase of the remaining 50% equity interest in Argus on March 31, 2009 which resulted in $62.9 million of goodwill, $14.0 million of customer relationship intangible assets, $1.0 million of other intangible assets and $26.0 million of proprietary software (which has been included in properties).
714603_11_ITEM8_P136_S2	During 2008, DST acquired BlueDoor which resulted in $0.7 million of customer relationships intangible assets.
714603_11_ITEM8_P137_S0	Intangible assets at December 31, 2010 primarily represent customer relationships with estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 17 years.
714603_11_ITEM8_P137_S1	The weighted average amortization period for customer relationships and other intangibles assets is 14.2 years and 6.2 years, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P137_S2	Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $5.8 million, $4.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P137_S3	Annual amortization for intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2010 is estimated to be $5.1 million for 2011, $5.1 million for 2012, $4.7 million for 2013, $4.6 million for 2014 and $30.0 million thereafter.
714603_11_ITEM8_P138_S0	The Company is obligated under notes and other indebtedness as follows (in millions):
714603_11_ITEM8_P139_S0	DST securitizes certain of its domestic accounts receivable through an accounts receivable securitization program with a third-party, multi-seller, asset-backed commercial paper conduit administered by a bank.
714603_11_ITEM8_P139_S1	The maximum amount that can be outstanding under this program is $150 million.
714603_11_ITEM8_P139_S2	The facility will expire by its terms on May 19, 2011, unless renewed.
714603_11_ITEM8_P140_S0	Under the terms of the accounts receivable securitization program, (a) DST periodically acquires accounts receivable originated by certain of its domestic subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, DST Output, DST Health Solutions, DST Technologies and Argus Health Systems (the "Subsidiary Originators"), (b) DST transfers receivables originated by DST and receivables acquired from the Subsidiary Originators, on a periodic basis, to a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of DST (the "SPE"), and (c) the SPE then sells undivided interests in the receivables to the commercial paper conduit.
714603_11_ITEM8_P140_S1	DST retains servicing responsibility over the receivables.
714603_11_ITEM8_P141_S0	On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted new authoritative accounting guidance related to transfers of financial assets.
714603_11_ITEM8_P141_S1	This guidance changed the accounting for securitizations of mortgages and other financial instruments and the consolidation requirements for qualifying special-purpose entities ("QSPE").
714603_11_ITEM8_P142_S0	sale; and d) enhanced disclosures to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a transferor's continuing involvement with transferred financial assets.
714603_11_ITEM8_P143_S0	Prior to the adoption of this new authoritative accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, the periodic transfers by the SPE of undivided interests in accounts receivable to the third-party, multi-seller, asset-backed commercial paper conduit met the requirements for sale accounting treatment and were considered an off-balance sheet arrangement.
714603_11_ITEM8_P143_S1	After January 1, 2010, the periodic transfers of undivided interests in accounts receivable no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment in accordance with the new accounting guidance and are accounted for as secured borrowings.
714603_11_ITEM8_P143_S2	DST has continuing involvement with the transferred assets because it maintains servicing responsibilities for the accounts receivable assets included in the accounts receivable securitization program.
714603_11_ITEM8_P144_S0	Accounts receivable assets transferred from DST and certain of its domestic subsidiaries to its wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary contain restrictions because they are not available to satisfy the creditors of any other person, including DST or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.
714603_11_ITEM8_P144_S1	Further, neither DST nor the SPE guarantees collectability of the receivables or the creditworthiness of obligors.
714603_11_ITEM8_P144_S2	The SPE retains an interest in the receivables in excess of the amount transferred to the conduit, and such receivables will continue to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_11_ITEM8_P144_S3	The carrying value of the retained interest approximates its estimated fair value at the balance sheet date.
714603_11_ITEM8_P144_S4	The Company believes increases in the level of assumed interest rates and/or credit losses compared to assumptions in effect at the balance sheet date by 10% or 20% would not materially affect the fair value of the retained interest at the reporting date.
714603_11_ITEM8_P145_S0	At December 31, 2010, the outstanding amount of undivided interests in the receivables held by the conduit was $125.0 million, unchanged from December 31, 2009.
714603_11_ITEM8_P145_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company's accounts receivable increased by $125.0 million resulting in a cash outflow being reported in the operating section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the current portion of debt associated with the accounts receivable securitization program increased by $125.0 million resulting in a cash inflow being reported in the financing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_11_ITEM8_P146_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows presents the net cash flows under the Company's accounts receivable securitization programs in the operating section.
714603_11_ITEM8_P147_S0	Aggregate transfers of undivided interests in the receivables from the SPE to the conduit were $1,769.5 million and $1,738.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P147_S1	The impact on net income stemming from these transfers was not material.
714603_11_ITEM8_P148_S0	Costs associated with the accounts receivable securitization program were included in other income during 2009 and 2008, but are included in interest expense effective January 1, 2010.
714603_11_ITEM8_P148_S1	The program costs applicable to the outstanding amount of undivided interests in the receivables are generally based on the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin.
714603_11_ITEM8_P149_S0	The secured promissory notes represent loans for real estate and equipment purchases.
714603_11_ITEM8_P149_S1	The outstanding amount at December 31, 2010 under the real estate notes and equipment notes was $3.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P150_S0	The real estate borrowings are due in installments with the balance due at the end of the term.
714603_11_ITEM8_P150_S1	Interest rates on the real estate borrowings are generally fixed.
714603_11_ITEM8_P151_S0	Fixed rates range from 6.0% to 8.39%.
714603_11_ITEM8_P151_S1	The real estate loans are secured by real property owned by the Company.
714603_11_ITEM8_P152_S0	The Company has a $50.0 million unsecured credit facility with a vendor.
714603_11_ITEM8_P152_S1	Proceeds from loans made under the credit facility can be used to make purchases of the vendor's eligible equipment, software or services.
714603_11_ITEM8_P152_S2	The draw period under the Company's existing $50 million equipment credit facility expired on June 30, 2010.
714603_11_ITEM8_P152_S3	The maturity date for each loan drawn under that facility is the earlier of approximately three years from the initial draw or August 1, 2013.
714603_11_ITEM8_P152_S4	The outstanding amounts under the old credit facility at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $6.3 million.

714603_11_ITEM8_P153_S3	The maturity date for each loan under this credit facility is the earlier of i) the last day of the thirty first (31 st ) calendar month following the loan date or ii) June 30, 2015.
714603_11_ITEM8_P153_S4	Interest rates applicable to the loans under this credit facility are generally based on the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.5% to 2.5%.
714603_11_ITEM8_P153_S5	The applicable margin is based on a grid schedule that adjusts borrowing costs up or down based upon the Company's consolidated leverage ratio.
714603_11_ITEM8_P153_S6	The outstanding amount at December 31, 2010 under the new credit facility was $1.2 million.
714603_11_ITEM8_P154_S0	Certain subsidiaries of DST entered into a real estate credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders.
714603_11_ITEM8_P154_S1	The credit agreement provides for a five-year, non-revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $120.0 million.
714603_11_ITEM8_P154_S2	Upon closing of the facility in September 2008, $115.0 million was advanced to DST.
714603_11_ITEM8_P154_S3	The credit facility is secured by, among other things, the real estate and properties owned by these DST subsidiaries as well as an assignment of the related leases, rents and other benefits of these assets.
714603_11_ITEM8_P155_S0	The interest rate applicable to the credit agreement is a floating rate tied to either offshore LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin rate of 1.75% or the prime rate (as defined in the credit agreement), as elected by DST.
714603_11_ITEM8_P155_S1	Principal and interest payments are due on the first of each month beginning in November 2008, and are based on a 20 year amortization schedule.
714603_11_ITEM8_P155_S2	Subject to provisions in the credit agreement, DST may voluntarily prepay the loan in whole or in part without premium or penalty, though amounts repaid may not be reborrowed.
714603_11_ITEM8_P155_S3	Concurrent with the lease, sale or other transfer of any of the collateralized properties, DST must prepay an amount equal to 125% of the allocated amount of such property as set forth in the credit agreement.
714603_11_ITEM8_P156_S0	The credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants, as well as certain customary events of default.
714603_11_ITEM8_P156_S1	Among other provisions, the credit agreement requires certain interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_11_ITEM8_P157_S0	If any event of default occurs and is continuing, all amounts payable under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable.
714603_11_ITEM8_P157_S1	The balance of the loan is due on September 16, 2013, the maturity date for the credit facility.
714603_11_ITEM8_P158_S0	In January 2009, the Company entered an interest rate swap with a bank to fix the interest rate on its syndicated real estate credit agreement at approximately 4.49% (includes 1.75% applicable margin rate) beginning January 2010.
714603_11_ITEM8_P158_S1	This interest rate swap qualifies as a derivative instrument.
714603_11_ITEM8_P159_S0	Accounting and reporting guidance for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value, and that the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
714603_11_ITEM8_P160_S0	The Company's interest rate swap is a cash flow hedge of future interest payments under the Company's real estate credit agreement and uses a pay-fixed, receive-variable, forward starting interest rate swap.
714603_11_ITEM8_P160_S1	The Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking this hedge is to eliminate the variability of interest cash flows related to the Company's floating-rate real estate credit agreement.
714603_11_ITEM8_P160_S2	Changes in the cash flows of the interest rate swap are expected to offset the changes in cash flows attributable to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR benchmark interest rate.
714603_11_ITEM8_P161_S0	The derivative instrument is a receive floating, pay 2.74% fixed, forward starting interest rate swap with an effective date of January 4, 2010 and a maturity date of September 16, 2013.
714603_11_ITEM8_P162_S0	Effectiveness of the hedge relationship is assessed on a quarterly basis both prospectively and retrospectively using the "cumulative dollar offset" method, in which the cumulative changes in the value of the hedging instrument are directly compared with the cumulative change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
714603_11_ITEM8_P162_S1	A dollar offset ratio of between 0.80 and 1.25 is required in order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
714603_11_ITEM8_P162_S2	At inception of the hedge, the cumulative dollar offset ratio is 1.00 since the terms of the perfect hypothetical swap match those of the actual swap.
714603_11_ITEM8_P162_S3	The derivative accounting guidance indicates that hedge effectiveness occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows of the hedged transaction.
714603_11_ITEM8_P163_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of the Company's pay-fixed, receive-variable, forward starting interest rate swap was a liability of $5.0 and $1.9 million, respectively, which is included in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_11_ITEM8_P163_S1	The Company determined there was no ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, which resulted in the changes in fair value of this swap being recorded in other comprehensive income.
714603_11_ITEM8_P164_S0	In August 2003, the Company issued $840 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures, consisting of $540 million of 4.125% Series A convertible senior debentures due 2023 and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Series B convertible senior debentures due 2023.
714603_11_ITEM8_P164_S1	The Series A debentures and Series B debentures bear interest at a rate of 4.125% and 3.625% per annum, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P165_S0	During fourth quarter 2009, DST entered into separate privately negotiated exchange agreements under which it exchanged $257.0 million in aggregate principal of the Company's outstanding 4.125% Series A convertible senior debentures due 2023 for $257.0 million in aggregate principal of new 4.125% Series C convertible senior debentures due 2023.
714603_11_ITEM8_P165_S1	At December 31, 2009, the amount outstanding under the Series A, B, and C convertible senior debentures was $151.8 million, $171.3 million and $257.0 million respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P166_S0	During 2010, the Company repurchased $67.7 million of the original Series A debentures, $8.8 million of the Series B debentures and $162.9 million of the Series C debentures and recorded a net loss of $6.4 million on these transactions.

714603_11_ITEM8_P167_S0	of accreted interest) senior convertible debentures were redeemed, which fully retired these series of debentures.
714603_11_ITEM8_P167_S1	At December 31, 2010, the Company had $94.1 million Series C senior convertible debentures outstanding.
714603_11_ITEM8_P168_S0	The Series C debentures bear regular cash interest on the original principal amount of each debenture at a rate of 4.125% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 until August 15, 2010.
714603_11_ITEM8_P168_S1	Beginning August 15, 2010, the Company will not pay regular cash interest on the Series C debentures prior to maturity.
714603_11_ITEM8_P168_S2	Instead, the original principal amount of the Series C debentures will increase daily at a rate of 4.125% per year to $1,700.28, which is the full accreted principal amount payable at maturity for each $1,000 original principal amount of the debentures.
714603_11_ITEM8_P168_S3	The Company will pay contingent interest during any six-month interest period commencing with the period from August 20, 2010 to February 14, 2011, and thereafter from February 15 to August 14 or August 15 to February 14, for which the average trading price of the Series C debentures for the applicable five trading-day reference period equals or exceeds 120% of the accreted principal amount of the Series C debentures.
714603_11_ITEM8_P169_S0	Beginning August 15, 2013, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Series C debentures at any time (upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice before the redemption date) at a redemption price equal to the accreted principal amount of the Series C debentures to be redeemed or purchased plus any accrued and unpaid cash interest, including contingent interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the redemption date.
714603_11_ITEM8_P169_S1	Debenture holders may require the Company to purchase the Series C debentures on August 15, 2014, 2015 and 2020 at a purchase price equal to the accreted principal amount of the Series C debentures to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid cash interest, including contingent interest and liquidated damages, if any, to such purchase date.
714603_11_ITEM8_P169_S2	For purchases of Series C debentures on August 15, 2014, the Company will pay the purchase price in cash.
714603_11_ITEM8_P169_S3	For purchases of Series C debentures on August 15, 2015 and 2020 and upon any fundamental change, the Company can pay the purchase price at its option in cash, common stock or any combination of cash and common stock.
714603_11_ITEM8_P170_S0	The Series C debentures are convertible under specified circumstances into shares of the Company's common stock at an initial conversion rate of 20.3732 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures (which is equal to an initial conversion price of $49.08), subject to adjustment in certain events.
714603_11_ITEM8_P170_S1	The Series C debentures include a make-whole interest provision which may increase the conversion rate upon certain fundamental changes, as described in the Series C indenture, prior to August 15, 2013.
714603_11_ITEM8_P170_S2	The conversion rights for the Series C debentures include: 1) during any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of DST's common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last day of the previous calendar quarter, is greater than or equal to 120% of the applicable conversion price; 2) subject to certain exceptions, during the five day business period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 original principal amount for each day of that period was less than 95% of the product of the last reported sales price of DST's common stock and the conversion rate on each such day; 3) if the debentures have been called for redemption; and 4) upon the occurrence of a specified corporate transaction as described in the indenture agreement.
714603_11_ITEM8_P170_S3	Upon conversion, the Company will have the right to deliver, in lieu of shares of its common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock.
714603_11_ITEM8_P170_S4	The Series C debentures if converted into common stock upon the occurrence of certain events would lead to the issuance of common stock and have a potentially dilutive effect on the Company's stock.
714603_11_ITEM8_P171_S0	amount over the principal and accrued and unpaid interest amounts.
714603_11_ITEM8_P171_S1	Holders of the Series C debentures did not have the right to convert these debentures at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
714603_11_ITEM8_P172_S0	On January 1, 2009, DST adopted new authoritative accounting guidance related to convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion.
714603_11_ITEM8_P172_S1	The guidance clarifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods.
714603_11_ITEM8_P172_S2	DST retrospectively applied this guidance to all periods prior to January 1, 2009 beginning with August 2003 when the senior convertible debentures were issued.
714603_11_ITEM8_P172_S3	DST used non-convertible debenture interest rates of 6.35% for the original $540 million 4.125% Series A senior convertible debentures and 5.68% for the original $300 million 3.625% Series B senior convertible debentures.
714603_11_ITEM8_P172_S4	The retrospective adoption of this guidance increased the amount of interest expense recorded by DST for historical income statements periods prior to April 1, 2006 (as the debenture discount would have been fully amortized by that date), but did not impact the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.

714603_11_ITEM8_P202_S1	These net operating losses expire in years 2022 through 2025 and are available to reduce future income taxes.
714603_11_ITEM8_P202_S2	Since these net operating losses were generated prior to the acquisition of ASI, their utilization is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
714603_11_ITEM8_P202_S3	The Company does not anticipate that such limitations will prohibit the utilization of the federal net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration.
714603_11_ITEM8_P202_S4	The Company has approximately $24.6 million of state net operating losses as of December 31, 2010 as a result of the Amisys Synertech acquisition in 2006.
714603_11_ITEM8_P202_S5	The Company believed it was not more likely than not that certain state deferred tax assets would be realized, and, accordingly, recorded a valuation allowance.
714603_11_ITEM8_P202_S6	During the Company's 2009 reassessment of this valuation allowance requirement, it was determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required.
714603_11_ITEM8_P202_S7	As a result, it was released during 2009.
714603_11_ITEM8_P203_S0	The Company has approximately $42.8 million of net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2010 in international jurisdictions.
714603_11_ITEM8_P203_S1	These carryforwards do not expire but may be limited in their ability to offset only certain income.
714603_11_ITEM8_P203_S2	A net benefit of approximately $7.4 million of these net operating losses will be recorded in additional paid in capital upon realization.
714603_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	Authoritative accounting guidance requires a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
714603_11_ITEM8_P204_S1	In evaluating the realizability of certain international net deferred tax assets, the Company also anticipates that limitations may result in the benefit of these amounts not being realized and has established corresponding valuation allowances as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $10.9 million and $11.1 million, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P204_S2	A $2.3 million valuation allowance previously established on deferred income tax assets of DST Output Limited (U.K.) was released during 2010.
714603_11_ITEM8_P204_S3	The release resulted from the acquisition of dsicmm Group.
714603_11_ITEM8_P204_S4	Innovative Output Solutions Limited ("IOS") was the beneficiary of this income tax benefit, and accordingly DST's share of the benefit was 70.5% or $1.6 million.
714603_11_ITEM8_P204_S5	The remaining portion of the income tax benefit (29.5% or $700,000) was attributed to the non-controlling interest.
714603_11_ITEM8_P205_S0	Prior to 1993, the Company generally did not provide deferred income taxes for unremitted earnings of certain investees accounted for under the equity method because those earnings have been and will continue to be reinvested indefinitely.
714603_11_ITEM8_P205_S1	Beginning in 1993, pursuant to the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance related to income taxes, the Company began providing deferred taxes for unremitted earnings of U.S. unconsolidated affiliates net of the 80% dividends received deduction provided for under current tax law.
714603_11_ITEM8_P205_S2	Through December 31, 2010, the cumulative amount of such unremitted earnings was $190.1 million.
714603_11_ITEM8_P205_S3	These amounts would become taxable to the Company if distributed by the affiliates as dividends, in which case the Company would be entitled to the dividends received deduction for 80% of the dividends; alternatively, these earnings could be realized by the sale of the affiliates' stock, which would give rise to tax at federal capital gains rates and state ordinary income tax rates, to the extent the stock sale proceeds exceeded the Company's tax basis.
714603_11_ITEM8_P205_S4	Deferred taxes provided on unremitted earnings through December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $12.9 million and $11.7 million, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P205_S5	As a result of the purchase of the remaining 50% interest of Argus on March 31, 2009, $0.9 million of deferred taxes provided on unremitted earnings of Argus was reversed during first quarter 2009.
714603_11_ITEM8_P206_S0	As of December 31, 2010, accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were $111.3 million.
714603_11_ITEM8_P206_S1	The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in the businesses of its foreign subsidiaries.
714603_11_ITEM8_P206_S2	As a consequence, no federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided for amounts which would become payable, if any, on the distribution of such earnings.
714603_11_ITEM8_P206_S3	In the event of such a distribution, the Company may be able to offset, at least in part, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such a distribution with foreign income tax credits which would become creditable as a result of such a distribution.
714603_11_ITEM8_P206_S4	It is not practicable for the Company to determine the income tax it would incur, if any, if such earnings were distributed.
714603_11_ITEM8_P207_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

714603_11_ITEM8_P208_S1	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes, which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods.
714603_11_ITEM8_P208_S2	As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $8.9 million of interest and penalties accrued associated with unrecognized tax benefits.
714603_11_ITEM8_P208_S3	The liability for interest and penalties increased $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 to $9.6 million.
714603_11_ITEM8_P208_S4	The liability for interest and penalties decreased $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2009.
714603_11_ITEM8_P209_S0	It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next year; however, the Company does not expect the change to have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position.
714603_11_ITEM8_P210_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
714603_11_ITEM8_P210_S1	The IRS examination for the tax years ended December 31, 2002 through 2005 was completed in February 2009.

714603_11_ITEM8_P210_S3	In the course of finalizing the examination, favorable adjustments of approximately $5.0 million were identified and recognized in first quarter 2009 that were not recorded at December 31, 2008, including foreign tax credit carryforward utilization.
714603_11_ITEM8_P211_S0	An IRS examination for the tax years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 began during 2009.
714603_11_ITEM8_P211_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the IRS has not proposed any significant adjustments which would be material to the Company's financial statements.
714603_11_ITEM8_P211_S2	Various state, local, and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities.
714603_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	Company does not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on its financial statements.
714603_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	In connection with the examination of the Company's 2000 tax return, the IRS accepted the manner in which the Company reported a transaction in its return.
714603_11_ITEM8_P213_S1	As a result, the Company reversed the income tax liability of $14.8 million previously provided for this matter, as well as $12.4 million of accrued interest and penalty, as a reduction of income tax expense during 2008.
714603_11_ITEM8_P214_S0	The Health Solutions exchange transaction (exchange of CSC shares for DST Health Solutions which was acquired April 2005) has been structured to meet the requirements for treatment as a tax-free exchange in accordance with Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code.

714603_11_ITEM8_P214_S2	The Company continued to accrue interest, through the Company's tax provision, related to this matter.
714603_11_ITEM8_P214_S3	During 2008, the Company changed its assessment of the probability of prevailing on this matter and released approximately $24.9 million or all of the previously recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions, which is consistent with the final IRS examination report for periods prior to and including 2005.
714603_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	The Company filed federal income tax refund claims for research and experimentation credits for the tax years 1996 through 2001.
714603_11_ITEM8_P215_S1	A settlement was reached with respect to the Company's refund claims for research and experimentation credits for the years 1996 through 2001.
714603_11_ITEM8_P215_S2	Despite the settlement, the IRS has challenged the amount and availability of research and experimentation credits attributable to the Company's operations after 2001.
714603_11_ITEM8_P215_S3	During 2010, the Company filed federal income tax refund claims for approximately $10 million of research and experimentation credits for the tax years 2002 through 2005.
714603_11_ITEM8_P215_S4	The IRS has recently initiated a full examination of these claims.
714603_11_ITEM8_P215_S5	Refund claims for tax years 2006 through 2010 are expected to be filed during 2011 and will be subject to examination by the IRS.
714603_11_ITEM8_P215_S6	In light of the continuing uncertainty related to the realization of any tax benefit associated with these claims, the Company has not yet recorded any significant income tax benefit in the accompanying financial statements related to these refund claims.
714603_11_ITEM8_P215_S7	To the extent refunds are received, the Company will reduce income tax expense when realized.

714603_11_ITEM8_P216_S1	These claims are estimated to exceed $10 million, and the IRS is expected to conduct a full examination of these claims.
714603_11_ITEM8_P216_S2	Due to uncertainty related to the realization of any tax benefit associated with these refund claims, the Company has not yet recorded any significant income tax benefit in the accompanying financial statements related to these refund claims and plans to fully reserve the benefit upon filing the claims.

714603_11_ITEM8_P217_S1	However, 0.1 million shares of preferred stock have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the Company's rights agreement, the terms of which entitle the holders of the Company's common stock to which the rights are attached to purchase 1/1000ths of a share of Series A Preferred Stock (or in some cases, shares of the Company's common stock, other securities, cash or other assets) at a purchase price of $225 per share.
714603_11_ITEM8_P218_S0	The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):
714603_11_ITEM8_P219_S0	The Company had approximately 46.3 million and 49.2 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
714603_11_ITEM8_P219_S1	Shares from options to purchase common stock that were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive totaled 3.4 million and 3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

714603_12_ITEM1_P40_S3	(4) DST acquired ALPS Holdings, Inc. on October 31, 2011.
714603_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	The Financial Services Segment provides the following products and services:
714603_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	The shareowner recordkeeping systems and services support open and closed-end mutual funds, Real Estate Investment Trusts ("REITs"), and various forms of tax advantaged savings vehicles.
714603_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	Included in tax-advantaged accounts are Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRAs"), and Educational Savings Plan Accounts, which encompass both Coverdell and Section 529 college savings plan accounts.
714603_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Most of the Company's clients who utilize the shareowner recordkeeping platform are "open-end" mutual fund companies, which obtain funds for investment by making a continuous offering of their shares.
714603_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	The proprietary system application for shareowner recordkeeping is TA2000.
714603_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	TA2000 handles virtually all shareowner related activities including purchases, redemptions, exchanges and transfers of shares; maintaining shareowner identification and share ownership records; reconciling cash and share activity; calculating and disbursing commissions to brokers and other distributors; processing dividends; reporting sales; and providing information for printing of shareowner trade confirmations, statements and year-end tax forms.
714603_12_ITEM1_P43_S3	The system processes multiple classes of equity, fixed income and money market funds.
714603_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	Shareowner recordkeeping services are offered on a full, remote and shared service basis.
714603_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	Selection by a client of the type of service is influenced by a number of factors, including cost and level of desired control over interaction with fund shareowners or distributors.
714603_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	"Full" service processing or "BPO" (Business Process Outsourcing) includes all necessary administrative and clerical support to process and maintain shareowner records, reconciling cash and share activity, answering inquiries from shareowners, brokers and others, and handling the TA2000 processing functions described above.
714603_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	In addition, full service mutual fund transfer agency clients may elect to have their end of day available client bank balances invested overnight by and in the name of the Company into credit-quality money market funds or other similar overnight investment alternatives.
714603_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	"Remote" service processing, or "ASP" (Application Service Provider), is designed to enable mutual fund management companies acting as their own transfer agent, and third party transfer agents that have their own administrative and clerical staff access to TA2000 at the Company's data processing facilities, using the Company's data communications network.
714603_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	"Shared" service processing enables clients to select the administrative functions to be handled by both client personnel and the Company.
714603_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	This service is facilitated by the use of "AWD" (Automated Work Distributor), DST's own business process management and customer contact system.
714603_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	The Company derives revenues from its shareowner recordkeeping services through use of the Company's proprietary software systems to provide such services, clerical processing services and other related products.
714603_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	Fees are generally charged based on a per account and number of funds basis for system processing services and on a per account, number of funds and transaction basis for clerical services.
714603_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	In limited instances, the Company has asset based fee arrangements.
714603_12_ITEM1_P47_S3	The Company's policy is not to license TA2000.
714603_12_ITEM1_P47_S4	The Company also derives revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in the Company's full service, transfer agency bank accounts.
714603_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	Investor attraction to a wide array of mutual fund investment products with increasingly specialized features has increased the number of mutual fund shareowner accounts, the volume of transactions and the complexity of recordkeeping.
714603_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	In addition, new technologies have changed the service requirements and distribution channels of the mutual fund market.
714603_12_ITEM1_P48_S2	The Company has made significant investments in computer capacities and systems functionality to handle the increasing marketplace demands in order to maintain its market position and to improve quality and productivity.
714603_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	A majority of the shareowner accounts serviced by the Company are at organizations that have been clients of the Company for more than five years.
714603_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	This distinguishes these accounts from broker subaccounts, which are serviced under contract with a broker/dealer.
714603_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	Registered accounts include both tax-advantaged and non tax-advantaged accounts on the books of the transfer agent.
714603_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company provided shareowner recordkeeping services for approximately 99.7 million shareowner accounts (registered and subaccounts).
714603_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	Registered accounts (both tax advantaged and non-tax advantaged accounts) serviced were 85.1 million at December 31, 2011.
714603_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	At December 31, 2011, 42.7 million of the registered accounts were tax advantaged.
714603_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	DST serviced 24.3 million IRAs invested in mutual funds and 8.9 million accounts in an assortment of retirement accounts (SAR-SEP, Keogh and SIMPLEs).
714603_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	In addition, DST supported 9.5 million educational savings accounts, of which 8.7 million are Section 529 plan accounts.
714603_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	DST Brokerage Solutions provides mutual fund shareowner recordkeeping services to brokerage firms who perform transfer agent functions in a subaccounting arrangement for mutual fund accounts that have been sold by the broker/dealer's financial advisors.
714603_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	The Company offers subaccounting services to broker/dealers on both a remote (ASP) and full service (BPO) basis.
714603_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	A broker/dealer providing subaccounting services may provide these services to multiple fund companies.
714603_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	In 2002, the Company enhanced TA2000 to meet the complex reconciliation and system interfaces required by broker/dealers.
714603_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	The Company believes using the same core processing functionality for both transfer agency shareowner recordkeeping (registered accounts) and subaccounting should further the clients' objectives of consistent accounting for shareowner positions, since the recordkeeping is done by one system TA2000.
714603_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Finix, Converge and Subserveo acquisitions in 2011 position DST Brokerage Solutions to sell more services and solutions to the broker/dealer industry.
714603_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Revenues for subaccounting services are generally based on the number of subaccounts serviced, and, because of the level of services provided directly by the broker/dealer, fewer of TA2000's features are required.
714603_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	This results in per account revenue for subaccounts being less than what the Company derives from its mutual fund shareowner processing services for registered accounts.
714603_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Subaccounts serviced by the Company were 14.6 million at December 31, 2011.
714603_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Company's TRAC system provides participant recordkeeping and administration for defined contribution plans, including 401(k), 403(b), 457, money purchase and profit sharing plans that invest in mutual funds, company stock, guaranteed investment contracts, annuities and other investment products.
714603_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	The Company offers TRAC on a full-service (BPO) and remote (ASP) basis.
714603_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	The Company believes the defined contribution market is a significant growth opportunity for its services and products because (i) that market continues to experience significant expansion as more employers shift away from defined benefit programs, (ii) the federal government has policies that encourage, and the retirement industry has a strong desire to expand, coverage to include the estimated 78 million Americans not participating in a retirement savings program today, and (iii) potential participation is likely to increase as retirement plan sponsors adopt auto enrollment and guaranteed income features for new employees.
714603_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	DST Retirement Solutions LLC ("DSTRS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of DST was formed to meet the needs of defined contribution service providers.
714603_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	The entity combines the Company's TRAC technology solution with Boston Financial Data Services, Inc.'s ("BFDS") defined contribution full service plan administration and recordkeeping unit.
714603_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	, DSTRS offers a variety of selective outsourcing options, including front- and back-office technology solutions for financial service organizations offering retirement plan recordkeeping for plans of any size.
714603_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	As of December 31, 2011, DSTRS serviced 4.6 million plan participants on the TRAC platform.
714603_12_ITEM1_P62_S2	Revenues from these services are primarily based on the number of participants in the defined contribution plans.
714603_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Company offers products designed to assist clients in meeting the expanding needs associated with distributing U.S. investment products through financial intermediaries.
714603_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	The array of solutions supporting distribution of investment products is expanding to address regulatory, service, and information needs of the financial service industry.
714603_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	Certain products are paid by investment managers and certain products are paid by the distributor.
714603_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	DST Vision is an aggregating Web site designed exclusively for financial advisors and broker/dealer back-office operations.
714603_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	The site enables mutual fund companies, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and variable annuity companies to reduce operational expense by replacing costly support phone calls from intermediaries with Web-based self-servicing.
714603_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	Providing over 140,000 financial advisors access to approximately 400 participating investment product manufacturers, Vision is an industry leading source of customer information.
714603_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	Having access to consolidated account information across all of an investor's product relationships provides significant customer support efficiencies to the financial intermediaries' operations.

714603_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	Vision charges are paid by the product companies through a combination of user access charges and activity related fees.
714603_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	Beginning in 2010, the Company began providing additional services to advisors affiliated with independent broker/dealers.
714603_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	Through a new offering called Vision Professional, advisors have access to presentation ready, automated and consolidated quarter-end shareholder reporting with supplemental product and holdings analytics.
714603_12_ITEM1_P66_S3	The fees for Vision Professional are paid by the advisors under a subscription service.
714603_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	FAN Mail (Financial Advisor Network) is a centralized data delivery source for investor account detail from mutual fund, variable annuity, and Real Estate Investment Trusts companies.
714603_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	FAN Mail provides advisors and broker/dealer back-offices the transactional and position information necessary to populate proprietary data-bases and software applications.
714603_12_ITEM1_P67_S2	Daily automated downloads streamline back-office administrative tasks, reporting, and compliance oversight.
714603_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	FAN Mail is compatible with the industries' most popular portfolio management and compliance software applications.
714603_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	With participation from more than 240 product manufacturers, FAN Mail is one of the industries' most comprehensive sources of investor account detail and transactional information.
714603_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	All FAN Mail charges are paid by the product companies based on the volume of account and transaction records delivered to the underlying intermediary.
714603_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	While Vision and FAN Mail largely service the same audience, there are distinct reasons an intermediary would use one or both products.
714603_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	Vision, as a web site, is designed to provide a real-time view of the underlying recordkeeping detail and is frequently used to resolve operations based servicing issues or to execute transactions or account maintenance.
714603_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	FAN Mail is used by intermediaries that need to take possession of the data to source proprietary software applications.
714603_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	Consequently, almost all FAN Mail users also use Vision.
714603_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	Omnibus Transparency offers a solution that provides mutual fund companies the ability to request and receive supplemental trade data from intermediaries for compliance with Rule 22c-2 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

714603_12_ITEM1_P254_S2	The duration of each patent term is generally 20 years from its earliest application filing date.
714603_12_ITEM1_P255_S0	A patent term is not renewable.
714603_12_ITEM1_P256_S0	The durations of the copyrights depend on a number of factors, such as who created the work and whether he or she was employed by the Company at the time.

714603_12_ITEM1_P257_S1	The Company believes that although the patents, trademarks and copyrights related to the Output Solutions Segment are valuable, the success of the Output Solutions Segment primarily depends upon its product and service quality, marketing and service skills.
714603_12_ITEM1_P258_S0	Despite patent, trademark and copyright protection, the Company may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate the Company's systems or processes.

714603_12_ITEM1_P259_S2	They typically obligate the Company's subsidiary to indemnify the client for damages arising from the subsidiary's breach, limit the subsidiary's liability for performing the services and allow either party to avoid automatic renewal by notice to the other.
714603_12_ITEM1_P260_S0	Other than terms and conditions that evolve as a result of technology capabilities, new laws, regulations, industry practices and contract administration procedures, the terms and conditions contained in typical Output Solutions Segment client agreements have not changed materially over the last three years.

714603_12_ITEM1_P264_S0	The information in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data), in Note 16 (Segment and Geographic Information) is incorporated by reference in partial response to this Item 1.

714603_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are many risks and uncertainties that can affect our future business, financial performance or share price.

714603_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	A description follows of some of the important factors that could have a material negative impact on our future business, operating results, financial condition or share price.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	This discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	You should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, reference in this section to "we," "ours," "us" or similar terms means the Company, together with its subsidiaries.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The level of importance of each of the following trends and risks may vary from time to time and the trends and risks are not listed in any specific order of importance.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	These risks, however, are not the only risks facing our Company.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Trends or events affecting our clients or their industries could decrease the demand for our products and services.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We derive our consolidated revenues from the delivery of products and services to clients in the mutual fund, brokerage, investment management, healthcare, telecommunications and utilities, cable TV, other financial service (i.e. insurance, banking, financial planning and mortgage) and other industries.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	A decline or lack of growth in demand for our products and services in any of the industries we serve could adversely affect our business and earnings.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Demand for our products and services among companies in those industries could decline for many reasons.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Consolidation or limited growth in an industry could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Events that adversely affect our clients' businesses, rates of growth or numbers of customers they serve, including decreased demand for our customers' products and services, adverse conditions in our customers' markets or adverse economic conditions generally could decrease demand for our products and services and the number of transactions we process.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We may be unsuccessful in predicting the needs of changing industries and whether potential customers will accept our products or services.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If trends or events do not occur as we expect, we could be negatively impacted.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission may issue regulations impacting third-party distributors of mutual funds, which could adversely affect our business.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The SEC may issue regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 or other legislative authority that would require brokers and financial intermediaries that distribute mutual funds to make more detailed fee disclosures at the point-of-sale.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Additionally, brokers and financial intermediaries may be subject to new fiduciary standards-of-care that could cause them to alter their methods of distribution.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We cannot predict the requirements the SEC may propose and finally adopt.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Regulations that would cause current distribution channels or interest in mutual fund investing to change could impact the number of accounts on our systems and could adversely affect our revenues.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	An increase in subaccounting services performed by brokerage firms could adversely impact our revenues.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our mutual fund clients may decide to allow a broker/dealer who has assisted with the purchase or sale of mutual fund shares to perform subaccounting services.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	A brokerage firm typically maintains an "omnibus" account with the fund's transfer agent that represents the aggregate number of shares of a mutual fund owned by the brokerage firm's customers.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The omnibus account structure results in fewer mutual fund shareowner accounts on our systems, which adversely affects our revenues.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We offer subaccounting services to brokerage firms that perform mutual fund shareowner subaccounting.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	As the recordkeeping functions in connection with subaccounting are more limited than traditional shareowner accounting, the fees charged are generally lower on a per unit basis.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Brokerage firms that obtain agreements from our mutual fund clients to use an omnibus accounting structure could cause accounts currently on our traditional recordkeeping system to convert to our subaccounting system, or to the subaccounting systems of other service providers, which could result in lower revenues.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The demand for our products and services could decrease if we do not continually address our clients' technology and capacity requirements.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our clients use computer technology based products and services in the complex and rapidly changing markets in which they operate.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We must substantially invest in technology and systems to meet customer requirements for technology and capacity.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we do not meet clients' technology and capacity requirements in advance of our competitors or if the investments we make are not cost-effective or do not result in successful products or services, our businesses could be adversely affected.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The quality or availability of postal system services could decrease, reducing the volume of printed customer communications and negatively impacting our business.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company is dependent on postal delivery systems for final delivery of printed customer communications.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Postal delivery systems are facing economic pressures from the reduction in first class mail and certain postal delivery systems have experienced work stoppages and other interruptions.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Accuracy and speed of delivery are important factors for clients using printed communications in their businesses.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Changes in the timeliness and quality of postal delivery could negatively impact the level of printed communications delivered by our customers to their clients.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	A decrease in such communications could lower our revenues.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Decreased demand for traditional printed and mailed communications may adversely affect our business, depending on the extent to which our customers' and their clients' acceptance of electronic alternatives continues to grow.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	To the extent clients' customers select electronic presentment and delivery of communications, the demand for our services for production and distribution of printed documents will decrease.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We provide electronic presentment and delivery solutions, but they are priced differently and require different capabilities than print-mail solutions.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Customers may choose to perform electronic hosting and distribution of communications to customers internally or select electronic solution providers other than the Company.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	These events could result in lower revenues.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Damage to our facilities or declining real estate values could impact our operations or financial condition.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We own, lease and manage real estate as part of our business.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The performance of our services also depends upon facilities that house central computer operations or operating centers or in which we process information, images, bills or statements.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Declining property values in the markets in which we own investment properties may adversely affect our financial condition.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Significant damage to any of our operating facilities could interrupt the operations at those facilities and interfere with our ability to serve customers.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may be unable to attract and retain capable technical personnel for our processing businesses or quality executives to manage the complex structure of our business.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our success depends on recruiting and retaining adept management and personnel with expertise in software and systems development and the types of computer hardware and software we utilize.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	An inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Companies in our industry compete fiercely for qualified management and technical personnel.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately compete for or keep qualified personnel.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Lack of qualified management could increase the risk of unfavorable business strategies, especially in a complex business like ours with multiple segments and operating entities.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Lack of qualified technical personnel could also affect our ability to develop the systems and services our clients demand.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our businesses are subject to substantial competition.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are subject to intense competition from other established service providers in all industries we serve.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Some of our competitors are able to bundle service offerings and offer more appealing pricing structures.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Some of our clients, or the clients they serve, may develop, have developed or are developing the in-house capacity to perform the transaction processing, recordkeeping and output services they have paid us to perform.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Some of our competitors and clients have greater financial and human resources and access to capital than we do.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our failure to successfully compete in any of our material operating businesses could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Competition could also affect the revenue mix of services we provide, resulting in decreased revenues in lines of business with higher profit margins.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We and companies in which we own a significant interest are subject to government regulation.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Any regulatory violations, changes or uncertainties could adversely affect our business.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	A number of our businesses are subject to U.S. or foreign regulation, including privacy, licensing, processing, recordkeeping, investment adviser, broker/dealer, reporting and related regulations.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Any violation of applicable regulations could expose us or those businesses to significant fines or sanctions or damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business or financial performance.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Governmental changes and uncertainties surrounding services we provide could increase our costs of business or diminish business, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial results.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our clients are subject to government regulation that could affect our business.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our clients are subject to extensive government regulation, including investment adviser, broker/dealer and privacy regulations applicable to services we provide to the financial industry and insurance, privacy and other regulations applicable to services we provide to the healthcare industry.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Changes in, and any violation by our clients of, applicable laws and regulations (whether related to the services we provide or otherwise) could diminish their business or financial condition and thus their demand for our products and services.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Demand could also decrease if we do not continue to offer products and services that help our clients comply with regulations.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We operate internationally and are thus exposed to foreign political, economic and other conditions that could adversely affect our revenues from or support by foreign operations.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Consolidated revenues from our subsidiaries in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and elsewhere outside the U.S. are an important element of our revenues.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Inherent risks in our international business activities could decrease our international sales and have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	These risks include potentially unfavorable foreign economic conditions, political conditions or national priorities, foreign government regulation, potential expropriation of assets by foreign governments, the failure to bridge cultural differences, and limited or prohibited access to our foreign operations and the support they provide.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We may also have difficulty repatriating profits or be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations in our international business.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Various events may cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter or year to year.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The nature of these events might inhibit our ability to anticipate and act in advance to counter them.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may be unsuccessful in determining or controlling when and whether events occur, that could cause varying financial results.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Unfavorable results may occur that we did not anticipate or take advance action to address.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our results may also vary as a result of pricing pressures, increased cost of supplies, timing of license fees, the evolving and unpredictable markets in which our products and services are sold, changes in accounting principles, and competitors' new products or services.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Investment decisions with respect to cash balances, market returns or losses on those investments, and limits on insurance applicable to cash balances held in bank and brokerage accounts, including as agent on behalf of our clients, could expose us to losses of such cash balances and adversely affect revenues attributable to cash balance deposit investments.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	As part of our transaction processing and other services, we maintain and manage large bank and investment accounts containing client funds, which we hold as agent, as well as operational funds.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our revenues include investment earnings related to client fund cash balances.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Our choices in selecting investments, or market conditions that affect the rate of return on or the availability of investments, could have an adverse effect on the level of such revenues.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	The amounts held in our operational and client deposit accounts could exceed the limits of government insurance programs of organizations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation, exposing us to the risk of loss.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our revenues and profit margins could decrease if clients cancel contracts, fail to renew contracts, renegotiate contracts or use our services at less than anticipated rates.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Client contract terminations, non-renewals, renegotiations or under-utilization of our services could decrease our revenues and profit margins.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We derive most of our revenue by selling products and services under long-term contracts.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We cannot unilaterally extend the terms of these contracts when they expire.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Some of these contracts contain "termination for convenience" clauses, which enable clients to cancel the agreements by providing written notice to us.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Any failure to extend these contracts under their current terms, or any early termination of these contracts by customers, could adversely affect our business.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Claims against us, including claims for the lost market value of securities and class action claims, could cause significant liability and damage our reputation and business prospects.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our proprietary applications and related consulting and other services include the processing of financial and healthcare transactions for our clients and their customers and the design of benefit plans and compliance programs.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The dollar amount of transactions processed is vastly higher than the revenues derived from providing these services.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Transaction processing or operational errors, or process mismanagement, could cause, among other potential issues, processing delays, disclosure of protected information, miscalculations, failure to follow a client's instructions or meet specifications, failure of third parties (including regulatory authorities) to recognize the limitations of our role as our clients' agent or consultant, mishandling of pass-through disbursements or other processes, or fraud committed by third parties.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We may be subject to claims, including class actions, for reimbursements, losses or damages arising from any transaction processing or operational error, or from process mismanagement.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Because of the sensitive nature of the financial and healthcare transactions we process, our liability and any alleged damages may significantly exceed the fees we receive for performing the service at issue.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Litigation could include class action claims based, among other theories, upon various regulatory requirements and consumer protection and privacy laws that class action plaintiffs may attempt to use to assert private rights of action.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Any of these claims and related settlements or judgments could affect our profitability, damage our reputation, decrease demand for our services, or cause us to make costly operating changes.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We are substantially dependent on our intellectual property rights, and a claim for infringement or a requirement to indemnify a client for infringement could adversely affect us.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We have made substantial investments in software and other intellectual property on which our business is highly dependent.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Any loss of our intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights of others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	We rely on patent, trade secret and copyright laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and security measures to protect our proprietary technology.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We cannot guarantee these measures will be effective.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Our products and services rely on technology developed by others, including open source software, and we have no control over possible infringement of someone else's intellectual property rights by the provider of this technology.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P49_S5	The owner of the rights could seek damages from us rather than or in addition to the persons who provide the technology to us.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P49_S6	We could be subject at any time to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to evaluate and defend.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Our clients may also face infringement claims, allege that such claims relate to our products and services, and seek indemnification from us.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Failure to protect our confidential information and that of our clients, their customers, and our employees could hurt our business.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We electronically maintain trade secrets and proprietary or sensitive information, including financial, personal health and other information of our clients, their customers and our employees.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In certain circumstances, vendors have access to such information in order to assist us with responsibilities such as, producing benefit plan identification cards, maintaining software we license on our own behalf or resell to others, or helping clients comply with anti-money laundering regulations.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	A breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could cause us to receive significant claims for liability or to incur significant costs for notices required by law to be sent to affected individuals.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P51_S3	It could also cause our customers to reconsider using our services and products, damage our reputation, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P51_S4	We maintain systems and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to electronic information and cybersecurity attacks, and we generally impose security requirements on our vendors, but we cannot guarantee these systems, procedures or requirements will always protect us.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Rapid advances in technology may prevent us from anticipating all potential security threats or promptly identifying all security breaches, and the limits and costs of technology, skills and manpower could prevent us from adequately addressing these threats.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We do not control certain businesses in which we have significant ownership.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We invest in joint ventures and other unconsolidated affiliates as part of our business strategy, and part of our net income is derived from our pro rata share of the earnings of those businesses.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Despite owning significant equity interests in those companies and having directors on their boards, we do not control their operations, strategies or financial decisions.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P53_S2	The other owners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the businesses we co-own.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Our pro rata share of any losses due to unfavorable performance of those companies could negatively impact our financial statements.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Some of our joint venture investments are subject to buy-sell agreements, which may, among other things, restrict us from selling our interests even when we believe it is prudent to do so.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We own interests in unconsolidated entities including Boston Financial Data Services, International Financial Data Services Limited Partnership, International Financial Data Services Limited, and various real estate joint ventures, and in consolidated entities owned less than 100% by the Company.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our interests in such unconsolidated and in certain consolidated entities are subject to buy/sell arrangements, which may restrict our ability to sell our interests when we believe it is prudent to do so.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	These arrangements may also allow us to purchase the other owners' interests to prevent someone else from acquiring them and we cannot control the timing of occasions to do so.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	The businesses or other owners may encourage us to increase our investment in or make contributions to the businesses at an inopportune time.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The financial results of our reinsurance subsidiary could be adversely affected if actual loss experience exceeds estimated loss experience.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our subsidiary, Vermont Western Assurance, Inc., which we refer to as Vermont Western, reinsures a portion of the risk in connection with replacing lost stock certificates for registered shareholders of unrelated companies.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Vermont Western utilizes underwriting procedures and actuarial advisors to assess risk and establish reserves against loss.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Vermont Western does not control clients' loss experience.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Vermont Western could inaccurately assess risk at any time and actual loss experience could exceed estimates.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Vermont Western's results, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results or cash flow.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We hold equity investments in companies that operate in various industries, and the value of those investments could decrease.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We hold significant investments in available-for-sale equity securities of other companies or other financial interests that are subject to fluctuations in market prices.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	A significant decline in the value of our equity investments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	We may not always be able to sell those investments at higher prices than we paid for them or than the value of the consideration used to acquire them.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We hold significant investments in illiquid private equity funds.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We are a limited partner in various private equity funds and have significant future capital commitments related to certain private equity fund investments.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Generally, private equity fund securities are non-transferable or are subject to long holding periods, and withdrawals from the private equity firm partnerships are typically not permitted.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Even when transfer restrictions do not apply, there is generally no public market for the securities.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Therefore, we may not be able to sell the securities at a time when we desire to do so.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Various plans, agreements, laws and organizational documents may have anti-takeover effects.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, certain plans and agreements, and applicable laws could make it more difficult for a party to make a tender offer for our shares or complete a takeover, which is not approved by our Board of Directors.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Because of contractual commitments, a change in control could affect our operating results and weaken our management retention and incentive tools.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	A change in control of the Company would trigger various rights and obligations in service agreements with our customers and in agreements governing our joint ventures.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	A change in control could also allow some clients to terminate their agreements with us or to obtain rights to use our processing software.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We are parties to joint venture agreements that allow other co-owners to buy our equity interests if we undergo a change in control.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Under certain executive equity-based and other incentive compensation awards, benefit programs and employment agreements with our management, a change in control by itself, or an individual's termination of employment without "cause" or resignation for "good reason" (each as defined in applicable agreements) after a change in control could accelerate funding, payment or vesting, as applicable, under such agreements and programs.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P68_S2	This accelerated funding, vesting or payment may decrease an employee's incentive to continue employment with us.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Certain executive officers have agreements with us that require us to continue to employ them for three years after a change in control or to pay certain amounts if we terminate their employment without cause or they resign for good reason following a change in control.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P68_S4	The executives might not be incented to achieve desired results for the new owners of our business, and the cost of keeping the executives on the payroll might deter potential new owners from acquiring us or hinder new owners from hiring replacement management.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our equity incentive and stockholders' rights plans could have a dilutive effect on our common stock.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our directors, officers and certain managers have received restricted stock units and options to purchase our common stock as part of their compensation.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P70_S1	These equity grants could have a dilutive effect on our common stock.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P70_S2	The rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock (as determined pursuant to the rights plan) without the approval of our Board of Directors.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P70_S3	A triggering of the rights plan could in some circumstances be dilutive in value to common stockholders who do not exercise their rights.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Conversion or settlement of our debentures could have a dilutive effect on our common stock or affect our liquidity.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The Company has issued convertible senior debentures.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Issuing common stock to settle conversions could be dilutive to the price of our common stock, and settlement of debentures for cash could affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flow.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The debentures are convertible into shares of common stock under specified circumstances, which we refer to as Conversion Triggers.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We cannot accurately predict when certain Conversion Triggers outside of our control may occur.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	To satisfy a conversion notice subsequent to a Conversion Trigger, we must deliver our common stock unless we properly notify the holder that we will settle with cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P74_S1	A conversion notice settled with shares will cause additional dilution to existing common shareholders, while a conversion notice settled in cash may require the Company to access credit markets or sell its investments.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future .
714603_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	In 2010, we began paying cash dividends on our common stock.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Future cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Payment of dividends is subject to applicable laws and to restrictions in applicable debt agreements.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	If we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited and our financial condition adversely affected.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our business strategy anticipates that we will supplement internal growth by pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P79_S1	We may be unable to identify suitable businesses to acquire.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P79_S2	We compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other complementary businesses.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P79_S3	If we cannot complete acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P79_S4	Information we obtain about an acquisition target may be limited and there can be no assurance that an acquisition will perform as expected or positively impact our financial performance.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P79_S5	Potential acquisitions involve risk, including the risk we would be unable to effectively integrate the acquired technologies, operations and personnel into our business, and the risk that management's attention and our capital would be diverted from other areas of our business.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	If our new investments and business initiatives are not successful, our financial condition could be adversely affected.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We are investing heavily in our products for the insurance, brokerage and retirement industries.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Our investments may not lead to successful deployment of our new products and increases in the level of volumes of certain businesses.
714603_12_ITEM1A_P81_S2	If we are not successful in creating value from our investments, the lack of new product sales could have a negative impact on the Company's financial condition and prospects.
714603_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following table provides certain summary information with respect to the principal properties owned or leased by the Company.
714603_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company believes the facilities, office space and other properties owned or leased are adequate for its current operations.
714603_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	(1) Property specified as being used for production includes space used for manufacturing operations and warehouse space.
714603_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	(2) In addition, but not included in the above table, the Company: 1) owns a number of surface parking facilities, a 120 unit apartment building, various developed and undeveloped properties, and an underground facility with 536,000 square feet leased to third parties, all located in Kansas City, Missouri; 2) owns approximately 200 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to its buildings in El Dorado Hills, California; 3) leases space in Whistler, Canada, Singapore, Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai, China, Zurich, Switzerland, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates; and 4) leases approximately 71,000 square feet of office and production space in the U.K., for which 24,000 square feet is subleased to third parties and the Company plans to sublease or exit the remainder.
714603_12_ITEM2_P2_S2	(3) Includes approximately 2.2 million square feet of property owned or leased by the Company's real estate subsidiaries, which are part of the Investments and Other Segment.
714603_12_ITEM2_P2_S3	These properties are primarily leased to other segments of the Company, including approximately 0.9 million square feet in the Financial Services Segment and 1.3 million square feet in the Output Solutions Segment.
714603_12_ITEM2_P2_S4	The Financial Services Segment has subleased 97,000 square feet of office space to third parties.
714603_12_ITEM2_P2_S5	The Output Solutions Segment has sub-leased 73,000 sq.

714603_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	On March 31, 2009, DST purchased the remaining 50% interest of Argus for $57.0 million in cash.
714603_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	As a result, Argus is no longer an unconsolidated affiliate, but rather is a wholly owned subsidiary resulting in DST consolidating the results of Argus after March 31, 2009 rather than recording equity in earnings of Argus.

714603_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	The plan resulted in a reduction of approximately 7% of the employee workforce, affecting all DST domestic and international business units.
714603_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	As a result of this workforce reduction, the Company incurred a pre-tax charge in 2010 of approximately $20.9 million in connection with its payment of related employee termination expenses.
714603_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	The plan was completed in December 2010.
714603_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.
714603_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company believes that its guarantee arrangements will not have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures, capital resources, liquidity or results of operations.
714603_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	These arrangements are described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
714603_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	In January 2009, the Company entered an interest rate swap with a bank to fix the interest rate on its syndicated real estate credit agreement at approximately 4.49% (includes 1.75% applicable margin rate) beginning January 2010.
714603_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	This interest rate swap qualifies as a derivative instrument.
714603_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company's interest rate swap is a cash flow hedge of future interest payments under the Company's real estate credit agreement and uses a pay-fixed, receive-variable, forward starting interest rate swap.
714603_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	The Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking this hedge is to eliminate the variability of interest cash flows related to the Company's floating-rate real estate credit agreement.
714603_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	Changes in the cash flows of the interest rate swap are expected to offset the changes in cash flows attributable to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR benchmark interest rate.
714603_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The derivative instrument is a receive floating, pay 2.74% fixed, forward starting interest rate swap with an effective date of January 4, 2010 and a maturity date of September 16, 2013.
714603_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Effectiveness of the hedge relationship is assessed on a quarterly basis both prospectively and retrospectively using the "cumulative dollar offset" method, in which the cumulative changes in the value of the hedging instrument are directly compared with the cumulative change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
714603_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	A dollar offset ratio of between 0.80 and 1.25 is required in order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
714603_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	At inception of the hedge, the cumulative dollar offset ratio is 1.00 since the terms of the perfect hypothetical swap match those of the actual swap.
714603_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	The derivative accounting guidance indicates that hedge effectiveness occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows of the hedged transaction.
714603_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	At December 31, 2011, the fair value of the Company's pay-fixed, receive-variable, forward starting interest rate swap was a liability of $4.3 million, which is included in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Company determined there was no ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, which resulted in the changes in fair value of this swap being recorded in other comprehensive income.
714603_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value, and that the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
714603_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Company may have obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	In the operations of its businesses, the Company's financial results can be affected by changes in equity pricing, interest rates and currency exchange rates.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Changes in interest rates and exchange rates have not materially impacted the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow of the Company.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Changes in equity values of the Company's investments have had a material effect on the Company's comprehensive income and financial position.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company's investments in available-for-sale equity securities are subject to price risk.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The fair value of the Company's available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2011 was approximately $773.0 million.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The impact of a 10% change in fair value of these investments would be approximately $47.2 million to comprehensive income.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	As discussed under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Comprehensive Income" above, net unrealized gains and losses on the Company's investments in available-for-sale securities have had a material effect on the Company's comprehensive income (loss) and financial position.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company and certain of its joint ventures derive a certain amount of their service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which the Company is the agent for clients.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The balances maintained in the bank accounts are subject to fluctuation.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company and BFDS had average daily cash balances of approximately $1.7 billion maintained in such accounts, of which approximately $1.1 billion were maintained at BFDS.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The Company estimates that a 50 basis point change in interest earnings rate would equal approximately $2.8 million of net income (loss).
714603_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company had $1.4 billion of debt, of which $777.6 million was subject to variable interest rates (Federal Funds rates, LIBOR rates, Prime rates).
714603_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	As discussed above in comprehensive income (loss), the amount recorded related to the Company's proportional share of unconsolidated affiliates' interest rate swap was a loss of $36.5 million.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In addition to the financial instruments listed above, the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under the Company's accounts receivable securitization program are determined based on variable interest rates associated with LIBOR.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The operation of the Company's subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The principal currencies involved are the British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Thai baht and Indian rupee.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Currency exchange rate fluctuations have not historically materially affected the consolidated financial results of the Company.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	At December 31, 2011, the Company's international subsidiaries had approximately $322.9 million in total assets and for the year ended December 31, 2011, these international subsidiaries produced approximately $12.4 million of a net loss.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The Company estimates that a 10% change in exchange rates could change total consolidated assets by approximately $32.3 million.
714603_12_ITEM7A_P7_S3	Furthermore, a 10% change in exchange rates based upon historical earnings in international operations could change consolidated reported net income for 2011 by approximately $1.2 million.

714603_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Generally, mutual fund products are promoted and distributed in fund groups, which provide investors with a variety of mutual fund investments and the ability to transfer investments from one fund to another within the group.
714603_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Investor attraction to a wide array of mutual fund investment products (to address different investment objectives) with increasingly specialized features has increased the number of shareowner accounts.
714603_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	Mutual fund product proliferation, combined with growing state and federal regulations, has increased the volume of transactions and the complexity of recordkeeping.

714603_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	The proprietary system application for shareowner recordkeeping is TA2000.
714603_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	TA2000 handles virtually all shareowner related activities including purchases, redemptions, exchanges and transfers of shares; maintaining shareowner identification and share ownership records; reconciling cash and share activity; calculating and disbursing commissions to brokers and other distributors; processing dividends; reporting sales; and providing information for printing of shareowner trade confirmations, statements and year-end tax forms.
714603_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	The system processes multiple classes of equity, fixed income and money market funds.
714603_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Shareowner recordkeeping services are offered on a full, remote and shared service basis.
714603_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	Selection by a client of the type of service is influenced by a number of factors, including cost and level of desired control over interaction with fund shareowners or distributors.
714603_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	"Full" service processing or "BPO" (Business Process Outsourcing) includes all necessary administrative and clerical support to process and maintain shareowner records, reconciling cash and share activity, answering inquiries from shareowners, brokers and others, and handling the TA2000 processing functions described above.

714603_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	"Remote" service processing, or "ASP" (Application Service Provider), is designed to enable mutual fund management companies acting as their own transfer agent, and third party transfer agents that have their own administrative and clerical staff access to TA2000 at the Company's data processing facilities, to use the Company's data communications network.
714603_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	This service is facilitated by the use of AWD (Automated Work Distributor), DST's own business process management and customer contact system.
714603_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Company's shareowner recordkeeping business derives revenues from fees which are generally charged based on a per account and number of funds basis for system processing services and on a per account, number of funds and transaction basis for clerical services.

714603_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Company believes that competition in the markets which shareowner recordkeeping operates is based largely on price, quality of service, features offered, the ability to handle rapidly changing volume, product innovation and responsiveness.
714603_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Company believes there is significant competition in its markets.
714603_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	The Company's ability to compete effectively is dependent in part on its access to capital.
714603_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	The Company's shareowner accounting business competes not only with third party providers but also with in-house systems.
714603_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	Financial institutions competing with the Company may have an advantage because they can take into consideration the value of their clients' funds on deposit or under management in pricing their services.
714603_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	This distinguishes these accounts from broker subaccounts, which are serviced under contract with a broker/dealer.
714603_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Registered accounts include both tax-advantaged and non tax-advantaged accounts on the books of the transfer agent.

714603_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Company offers products designed to assist clients in meeting the expanding needs associated with distributing U.S. investment products through financial intermediaries.
714603_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	The array of solutions supporting distribution of investment products is expanding to address regulatory, service and information needs of the financial services industry.
714603_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Certain products are paid by investment managers and certain products are paid by the distributor.
714603_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	The two primary distribution support solutions offered are DST Vision and FAN Mail.
714603_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	DST Vision is an aggregating Web site designed exclusively for financial advisors and broker/dealer back-office operations.
714603_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	The site enables mutual fund companies, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and variable annuity companies to reduce operational expense by replacing costly support phone calls from intermediaries with Web-based self-servicing.

714603_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	Having access to consolidated account information across all of an investor's product relationships provides significant customer support efficiencies to the financial intermediaries' operations.
714603_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	Advisors can also utilize portfolio management tools, access electronic shareholder statements, and initiate transaction processing.
714603_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Vision charges are paid by the product companies through a combination of user access charges and activity- related fees.
714603_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	The Company also provides additional services to advisors affiliated with independent broker/dealers.
714603_13_ITEM1_P39_S2	Through the Vision Professional product, advisors have access to presentation-ready, automated and consolidated quarter-end shareholder reporting with supplemental product and holdings analytics.

714603_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	FAN Mail (Financial Advisor Network) is a centralized data delivery source for investor account detail from mutual fund, variable annuity, and Real Estate Investment Trusts companies.
714603_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	FAN Mail provides advisors and broker/dealer back-offices the transactional and position information necessary to populate proprietary database and software applications.
714603_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	Daily automated downloads streamline back-office administrative tasks, reporting, and compliance oversight.
714603_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	FAN Mail is compatible with the industries' most popular portfolio management and compliance software applications.

714603_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	FAN Mail charges are paid by the product companies based on the volume of account and transaction records delivered to the underlying intermediary.
714603_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	While Vision and FAN Mail largely service the same audience, there are distinct reasons an intermediary would use one or both products.
714603_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Vision, as a web site, is designed to provide a real-time view of the underlying recordkeeping detail and is frequently used to resolve operations-based servicing issues or to execute transactions or perform account maintenance.
714603_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	FAN Mail is used by intermediaries that need to take possession of the data to source proprietary software applications.
714603_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	Consequently, almost all FAN Mail users also use Vision.
714603_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	The Company also offers a variety of other solutions to mutual fund companies, including Omnibus Transparency and SalesConnect.
714603_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Omnibus Transparency offers a solution that provides mutual fund companies the ability to request and receive supplemental trade data from intermediaries for compliance with Rule 22c-2 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

714603_13_ITEM1_P73_S4	The Company believes using the same core processing functionality for both transfer agency shareowner recordkeeping (registered accounts) and subaccounting should further the clients' objectives of consistent accounting for shareowner positions, since the recordkeeping is done by one system TA2000.
714603_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	The Finix, Converge and Subserveo acquisitions in 2011 position DST Brokerage Solutions to sell more services and solutions to the broker/dealer industry.

714603_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	This results in per account revenue for subaccounts being less than what the Company derives from its mutual fund shareowner processing services for registered accounts.
714603_13_ITEM1_P75_S2	Subaccounts serviced by the Company were 12.4 million at December 31, 2012.
714603_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	The Company's subaccounting business competes not only with third party providers but also with in-house systems.
714603_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	Financial institutions competing with the Company may have an advantage because they can take into consideration the value of their clients' funds on deposit or under management in pricing their services.

714603_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	DST Health Solutions' competitors vary by the healthcare market segment.
714603_13_ITEM1_P93_S1	These competitors' solutions are primarily based on complete replacement of a payer's core system.
714603_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	DSTHS believes that a component application approach shifts the focus away from core application replacement to one in which clients have more alternatives for modernization of the business operation.
714603_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	With a component approach, health payer clients can still choose core application replacement if warranted, or adopt component applications that address only those areas of the business that are in the highest need of improvement, resulting in protection of the client's current IT investment and less overall disruption to its business operation.
714603_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	DSTHS believes there is a competitive advantage in providing physician practice management services that have been enhanced with AWD in outsourcing models.

714603_13_ITEM1_P105_S2	Another competitive difference is that Argus' business model provides a transparent drug pricing transaction between Argus customer and the pharmacy with no markup between the price paid by its customer and the negotiated charge from the pharmacy.
714603_13_ITEM1_P105_S3	Some competitors derive revenue through "spread" pricing whereby the drug cost charged to customers is higher than the negotiated rate with pharmacies.
714603_13_ITEM1_P105_S4	In addition, some competitors own mail order facilities which enable them to earn spread revenue on the drug transaction and may result in conflicts in objectives of the servicer to drive members to mail order vs. objectives of the customer to offer more competitive rates for other alternatives, such as 90 days at retail.

714603_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our mutual fund clients may decide to allow a broker/dealer who has assisted with the purchase or sale of mutual fund shares to perform subaccounting services.

714603_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Changes in, and any violation by our clients of, applicable laws and regulations (whether related to the services we provide or otherwise) could diminish their business or financial condition and thus their demand for our products and services.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Demand could also decrease if we do not continue to offer products and services that help our clients comply with regulations.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We operate internationally and are thus exposed to foreign political, economic and other conditions that could adversely affect our revenues from or support by foreign operations.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Consolidated revenues from our subsidiaries in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and elsewhere outside the U.S. are an important element of our revenues.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Inherent risks in our international business activities could decrease our international sales and have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	These risks include potentially unfavorable foreign economic conditions, political conditions or national priorities, foreign government regulation, potential expropriation of assets by foreign governments, the failure to bridge cultural differences, and limited or prohibited access to our foreign operations and the support they provide.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We may also have difficulty repatriating profits or be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations in our international business.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Various events may cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter or year to year.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The nature of these events might inhibit our ability to anticipate and act in advance to counter them.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may be unsuccessful in determining or controlling when and whether events occur that could cause varying financial results.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Unfavorable results may occur that we did not anticipate or take advance action to address.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The various reasons our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate include unanticipated economic conditions, and costs for starting up significant client operations, for hiring staff, and for developing products.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our results may also vary as a result of pricing pressures, increased cost of supplies, timing of license fees, the evolving and unpredictable markets in which our products and services are sold, changes in accounting principles, and competitors' new products or services.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Investment decisions with respect to cash balances, market returns or losses on those investments, and limits on insurance applicable to cash balances held in bank and brokerage accounts, including as agent on behalf of our clients, could expose us to losses of such cash balances and adversely affect revenues attributable to cash balance deposit investments.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	As part of our transaction processing and other services, we maintain and manage large bank and investment accounts containing client funds, which we hold as agent, as well as operational funds.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Our revenues include investment earnings related to client fund cash balances.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Our choices in selecting investments, or market conditions that affect the rate of return on or the availability of investments, could have an adverse effect on the level of such revenues.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P42_S3	The amounts held in our operational and client deposit accounts could exceed the limits of government insurance programs of organizations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation, exposing us to the risk of loss.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our revenues and profit margins could decrease if client contracts are terminated or fail to renew or if clients renegotiate contracts or utilize our services at lower than anticipated levels.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We derive most of our revenue by selling products and services under long-term contracts, many of which contain terms and conditions based on anticipated levels of utilization of our services.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We cannot unilaterally extend the terms of our client contracts when they expire.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Contracts can terminate during the term of agreement for various reasons, including through "termination for convenience" clauses in some contracts that enable clients to cancel by written notice.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Our revenues and profit could decrease as a result of terminations or non-renewals of client contracts; extensions of client contracts under, or contract re-negotiations resulting in, less favorable terms; or utilization of services at less than anticipated levels.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Claims against us, including claims for the lost market value of securities and class action claims, could cause significant liability and damage our reputation and business prospects.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our proprietary applications and related consulting and other services include the processing of financial and healthcare transactions for our clients and their customers and the design of benefit plans and compliance programs.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The dollar amount of transactions processed is vastly higher than the revenues derived from providing these services.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Transaction processing or operational errors, or process mismanagement, could cause, among other potential issues, processing delays, disclosure of protected information, miscalculations, failure to follow a client's instructions or meet specifications, failure of third parties (including regulatory authorities) to recognize the limitations of our role as our clients' agent or consultant, mishandling of pass-through disbursements or other processes, or fraud committed by third parties.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We may be subject to claims, including class actions, for reimbursements, losses or damages arising from any transaction processing or operational error, or from process mismanagement.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Because of the sensitive nature of the financial and healthcare transactions we process, our liability and any alleged damages may significantly exceed the fees we receive for performing the service at issue.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	requirements and consumer protection and privacy laws that class action plaintiffs may attempt to use to assert private rights of action.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Any of these claims and related settlements or judgments could affect our profitability, damage our reputation, decrease demand for our services, or cause us to make costly operating changes.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We are substantially dependent on our intellectual property rights, and a claim for infringement or a requirement to indemnify a client for infringement could adversely affect us.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We have made substantial investments in software and other intellectual property on which our business is highly dependent.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Any loss of our intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights of others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	We rely on patent, trade secret and copyright laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and security measures to protect our proprietary technology.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	We cannot guarantee these measures will be effective.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Our products and services rely on technology developed by others, including open source software, and we have no control over possible infringement of someone else's intellectual property rights by the provider of this technology.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P50_S5	The owner of the rights could seek damages from us rather than or in addition to the persons who provide the technology to us.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P50_S6	We could be subject at any time to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to evaluate and defend.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P50_S7	Our clients may also face infringement claims, allege that such claims relate to our products and services, and seek indemnification from us.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Failure to protect our confidential information and that of our clients, their customers, and our employees could hurt our business.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We electronically maintain trade secrets and proprietary or sensitive information, including financial, personal health and other information of our clients, their customers and our employees.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In certain circumstances, vendors have access to such information in order to assist us with responsibilities such as, producing benefit plan identification cards, maintaining software we license on our own behalf or resell to others, or helping clients comply with anti-money laundering regulations.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	A breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could cause us to receive significant claims for liability or to incur significant costs for notices required by law to be sent to affected individuals.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P52_S3	It could also cause our customers to reconsider using our services and products, damage our reputation, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P52_S4	We maintain systems and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to electronic information and cybersecurity attacks, and we generally impose security requirements on our vendors, but we cannot guarantee these systems, procedures or requirements will always protect us.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Rapid advances in technology may prevent us from anticipating all potential security threats or promptly identifying all security breaches, and the limits and costs of technology, skills and manpower could prevent us from adequately addressing these threats.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We do not control certain businesses in which we have significant ownership.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We invest in joint ventures and other unconsolidated affiliates as part of our business strategy, and part of our net income is derived from our pro rata share of the earnings of those businesses.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Despite owning significant equity interests in those companies and having directors on their boards, we do not control their operations, strategies or financial decisions.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	The other owners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the businesses we co-own.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Our pro rata share of any losses due to unfavorable performance of those companies could negatively impact our financial statements.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Some of our joint venture investments are subject to buy-sell agreements, which may, among other things, restrict us from selling our interests even if we were to determine it is prudent to do so.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We own interests in unconsolidated entities including Boston Financial Data Services, International Financial Data Services Limited Partnership, International Financial Data Services Limited, and various real estate joint ventures.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Our interests in such unconsolidated entities are subject to buy/sell arrangements, which may restrict our ability to sell our interests even if we were to determine it is prudent to do so.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	These arrangements may also allow us to purchase the other owners' interests to prevent someone else from acquiring them and we cannot control the timing of occasions to do so.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P56_S3	The businesses or other owners may encourage us to increase our investment in or make contributions to the businesses at an inopportune time.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The financial results of our reinsurance subsidiary could be adversely affected if actual loss experience exceeds estimated loss experience.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our subsidiary, Vermont Western Assurance, Inc., which we refer to as Vermont Western, reinsures a portion of the risk in connection with replacing lost stock certificates for registered shareholders of unrelated companies.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Vermont Western utilizes underwriting procedures and actuarial advisors to assess risk and establish reserves against loss.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Vermont Western does not control clients' loss experience.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Vermont Western could inaccurately assess risk at any time and actual loss experience could exceed estimates.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Vermont Western's results, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results or cash flow.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We hold equity investments in companies that operate in various industries, and the value of those investments could decrease.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We hold significant investments in available-for-sale equity securities of other companies or other financial interests that are subject to fluctuations in market prices.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	A significant decline in the value of our equity investments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P61_S2	We may not always be able to sell those investments at higher prices than we paid for them or than the value of the consideration used to acquire them.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We hold significant investments in illiquid private equity funds.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We are a limited partner in various private equity funds and have future capital commitments related to certain private equity fund investments.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Generally, private equity fund securities are non-transferable or are subject to long holding periods, and withdrawals from the private equity firm partnerships are typically not permitted.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Even when transfer restrictions do not apply, there is generally no public market for the securities.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Therefore, we may not be able to sell the securities at a time when we desire to do so.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Various plans, agreements, laws and organizational documents may have anti-takeover effects.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, certain plans and agreements, and applicable laws could make it more difficult for a party to make a tender offer for our shares or complete a takeover, which is not approved by our Board of Directors.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Because of contractual commitments, a change in control could affect our operating results and weaken our management retention and incentive tools.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	A change in control of the Company would trigger various rights and obligations in service agreements with our customers and in agreements governing our joint ventures.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	A change in control could also allow some clients to terminate their agreements with us or to obtain rights to use our processing software.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We are parties to joint venture agreements that allow other co-owners to buy our equity interests if we undergo a change in control.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Under certain executive equity-based and other incentive compensation awards, benefit programs and employment agreements with our management, a change in control by itself, or an individual's termination of employment without "cause" or resignation for "good reason" (each as defined in applicable agreements) after a change in control could accelerate funding, payment or vesting, as applicable, under such agreements and programs.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P68_S2	This accelerated funding, vesting or payment may decrease an employee's incentive to continue employment with us.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Certain executive officers have agreements with us that require us to continue to employ them for three years after a change in control or to pay certain amounts if we terminate their employment without cause or they resign for good reason following a change in control.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P68_S4	The executives might not be incented to achieve desired results for the new owners of our business, and the cost of keeping the executives on the payroll might deter potential new owners from acquiring us or hinder new owners from hiring replacement management.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Certain changes in ownership of the Company could potentially affect the continuation of investment advisory and distribution services provided by ALPS subsidiaries, which could potentially limit the Company's share repurchases and negatively impact the Company's financial results.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, ALPS Holdings, Inc., has subsidiaries that serve as investment advisors or distributors for certain registered investment companies ("Funds").
714603_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	If more than 25% of the Company's outstanding voting securities were to become held by a single owner, a change of control of the ALPS subsidiaries constituting an assignment of their investment advisory contracts and distribution contracts could be deemed to have occurred.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Any deemed assignment would automatically terminate the ALPS subsidiaries' investment advisory and distribution contracts with the Funds, and the Funds would be required to seek shareowner approval of new investment advisory contracts in order to continue an advisory relationship with the ALPS subsidiaries.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P70_S3	There can be no assurance that any Fund with a distribution contract would retain the ALPS subsidiary as its distributor or that any Fund with an investment advisory contract would obtain the required shareowner vote to retain, or that it would retain, the ALPS subsidiary as its investment advisor.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P70_S4	The potential impact of a deemed assignment may limit the Company's ability to repurchase its shares.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P70_S5	The loss by ALPS subsidiaries of investment advisory and/or distribution contracts could negatively impact the financial condition and earnings of the Company.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our equity incentive and stockholders' rights plans could have a dilutive effect on our common stock.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our directors, officers and certain managers have received restricted stock units and options to purchase our common stock as part of their compensation.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P72_S1	These equity grants could have a dilutive effect on our common stock.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock (as determined pursuant to the rights plan) without the approval of our Board of Directors.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P72_S3	A triggering of the rights plan could in some circumstances be dilutive in value to common stockholders who do not exercise their rights.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Conversion or settlement of our debentures could have a dilutive effect on our common stock or affect our liquidity.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The Company has issued convertible senior debentures.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Issuing common stock to settle conversions could be dilutive to the price of our common stock, and settlement of debentures for cash could affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flow.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P74_S2	The debentures are convertible into shares of common stock under specified circumstances, which we refer to as Conversion Triggers.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We cannot accurately predict when certain Conversion Triggers outside of our control may occur.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	To satisfy a conversion notice subsequent to a Conversion Trigger, we must deliver our common stock unless we properly notify the holder that we will settle with cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P76_S1	A conversion notice settled with shares will cause additional dilution to existing common shareholders, while a conversion notice settled in cash may require the Company to access credit markets or sell its investments.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future .
714603_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In 2010, we began paying cash dividends on our common stock.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Future cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Payment of dividends is subject to applicable laws and to restrictions in applicable debt agreements.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	If we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited and our financial condition adversely affected.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our business strategy anticipates that we will supplement internal growth by pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We may be unable to identify suitable businesses to acquire.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P81_S2	We compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other complementary businesses.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P81_S3	If we cannot complete acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P81_S4	Information we obtain about an acquisition target may be limited and there can be no assurance that an acquisition will perform as expected or positively impact our financial performance.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P81_S5	Potential acquisitions involve risk, including the risk we would be unable to effectively integrate the acquired technologies, operations and personnel into our business, and the risk that management's attention and our capital would be diverted from other areas of our business.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	If our new investments and business initiatives are not successful, our financial condition could be adversely affected.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We are investing heavily in our products for the brokerage and retirement industries.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Our investments may not lead to successful deployment of our new products and increases in the level of volumes of certain businesses.
714603_13_ITEM1A_P83_S2	If we are not successful in creating value from our investments, the lack of new product sales could have a negative impact on the Company's financial condition and prospects.
714603_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following table provides certain summary information with respect to the principal properties owned or leased by the Company.
714603_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company believes the facilities, office space and other properties owned or leased are adequate for its current operations.

714603_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of their businesses.
714603_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	While the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes, after consultation with legal counsel, that the final outcome in such proceedings, in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
714603_13_ITEM4_P0_S0	Pursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K and instruction 3 to paragraph (b) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K, the following list is included as an unnumbered Item in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in lieu of being included in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement in connection with its annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for May 14, 2013.

714603_13_ITEM4_P1_S3	None of the executive officers are related to one another or to any of the members of the Board of Directors.

714603_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.
714603_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company believes that its guarantee arrangements will not have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures, capital resources, liquidity or results of operations.
714603_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	These arrangements are described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
714603_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	In January 2009, the Company entered an interest rate swap with a bank to fix the interest rate on its syndicated real estate credit agreement at approximately 4.49% (includes 1.75% applicable margin rate) beginning January 2010.
714603_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	This interest rate swap qualifies as a derivative instrument.
714603_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company's interest rate swap is a cash flow hedge of future interest payments under the Company's real estate credit agreement and uses a pay-fixed, receive-variable, forward starting interest rate swap.
714603_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	The Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking this hedge is to eliminate the variability of interest cash flows related to the Company's floating-rate real estate credit agreement.
714603_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	Changes in the cash flows of the interest rate swap are expected to offset the changes in cash flows attributable to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR benchmark interest rate.
714603_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	The derivative instrument is a receive-variable, pay 2.74% fixed, forward starting interest rate swap with an effective date of January 4, 2010 and a maturity date of September 16, 2013.
714603_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Effectiveness of the hedge relationship is assessed on a quarterly basis both prospectively and retrospectively using the "cumulative dollar offset" method, in which the cumulative changes in the value of the hedging instrument are directly compared with the cumulative change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
714603_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	A dollar offset ratio of between 0.80 and 1.25 is required in order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
714603_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	At inception of the hedge, the cumulative dollar offset ratio is 1.00 since the terms of the perfect hypothetical swap match those of the actual swap.
714603_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	The derivative accounting guidance indicates that hedge effectiveness occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows of the hedged transaction.
714603_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	rate swap was a liability of $2.3 million, which is included in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	The Company determined there was no ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, which resulted in the changes in fair value of this swap being recorded in other comprehensive income.
714603_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Accounting and reporting guidance for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value, and that the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
714603_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	In addition, the Company has $90.1 million of convertible senior debentures outstanding at December 31, 2012.
714603_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	The debentures are convertible under specified circumstances into shares of the Company's common stock.
714603_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	On January 1, 2012, DST adopted an accounting standard that modifies the presentation of comprehensive income in the financial statements.
714603_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The standard requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
714603_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	The Company elected the latter presentation option upon adopting this accounting standard.
714603_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	This standard eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity.
714603_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.
714603_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	On January 1, 2012, DST adopted an accounting standard related to testing for goodwill impairment.
714603_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	The guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.
714603_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent.
714603_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.
714603_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	On January 1, 2012, DST adopted an accounting standard related to fair value measurements and disclosure requirements.
714603_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	The guidance is intended to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
714603_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.
714603_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
714603_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
714603_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
714603_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
714603_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; software capitalization and amortization; depreciation of fixed assets; valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill; accounting for investments; and accounting for income taxes.
714603_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

714603_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	If there is a customer acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until the Company has evidence of customer acceptance.
714603_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis; 2) there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item(s); and 3) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control of the Company.
714603_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration should be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
714603_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE"), which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence ("TPE") such as how competitors have priced similar items.
714603_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	If such evidence is unavailable, the Company uses its best estimate of the selling price ("BESP"), which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.
714603_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	It is not common for the Company to use TPE and BESP as VSOE can be established for the majority of DST's client arrangements.

714603_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	In the event a portion of the Company's revenues are due 12 months or more from the invoice date, the Company accounts for the revenue as not being fixed and determinable.

714603_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Company's standard business practice is to bill monthly for development, consulting and training services on a time and materials basis.

714603_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	When it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, the Company assesses actual impairment based on gross cash flows.
714603_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Company's assessment of goodwill for impairment includes comparing the fair value to the net book value of our reporting units.
714603_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Company estimates fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches.
714603_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is necessary.
714603_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company performs a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
714603_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Specifically, the Company allocates the fair value of the affected reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill.
714603_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet, we record an impairment charge for the difference.
714603_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company's impairment tests indicated during 2012 that there were no impairments, except for the goodwill held at the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit.
714603_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The Company's evaluation includes multiple assumptions that may change over time.
714603_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	If future undiscounted cash flows at the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit become less than those projected, further impairment charges may become necessary.
714603_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company had $1,113.1 million of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	After the $60.8 million goodwill impairment of the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit, remaining goodwill and net intangible assets in the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit at December 31, 2012 are $7.6 million and $27.6 million, respectively.
714603_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Company has three significant types of investments that require accounting judgment: 1) investments in available-for-sale securities, the largest of which is its investment in State Street; 2) investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which is comprised principally of BFDS, IFDS U.K., IFDS L.P. and certain real estate joint ventures; and 3) investments in private equity funds and other investments accounted for under the cost method.
714603_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	The Company accounts for investments in corporations, for which it owns less than 20% and does not have significant influence, in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, which requires the Company to designate its investments as trading or available-for-sale.
714603_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	At December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately $611.5 million of available-for-sale securities.
714603_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income.
714603_13_ITEM7_P77_S3	At December 31, 2012, the Company's available-for-sale securities had gross unrealized holding gains of $412.4 million, gross unrealized holding losses of $1.9 million and unrealized gains from foreign currency exchange rates of $0.1 million.
714603_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	The impact of a 10% change in fair value of the Company's available-for-sale investments would be approximately $37.9 million to comprehensive income.
714603_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company records an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary.
714603_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment's current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on the Company's financial position.
714603_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	The equity method of accounting is used for investments in corporations in which the Company or its subsidiaries have at least a 20% voting interest and significant influence but does not control, and for all investments in partnerships and similar interests which the Company has at least 5% ownership and does not control.
714603_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	The Company classifies these investments as unconsolidated affiliates.
714603_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	Under the equity method, the Company recognizes income or losses from its pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates' net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of the Company's investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Partnership and similar investment interests (including investments in private equity funds where the Company is a limited partner) in which the Company has at least a 5% ownership are accounted for on an equity method basis based on the Company's pro-rata ownership; the cost method of accounting is used for these investments when the Company has a de-minimus ownership percentage and no ability to exercise significant influence.
714603_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	The Company's cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.
714603_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance.
714603_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns.
714603_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).
714603_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
714603_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact the consolidated financial statements.
714603_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
714603_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be required.
714603_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	If the Company ultimately determines that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, then it reverses the liability and recognizes a tax benefit during the period in which it determines that the liability is no longer necessary.
714603_13_ITEM7_P84_S3	The Company also recognizes tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that its positions will be sustained if challenged by the taxing authorities.
714603_13_ITEM7_P84_S4	To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which liabilities have been established, or is required to pay amounts in excess of its liabilities, the Company's effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected.
714603_13_ITEM7_P84_S5	An unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and may result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_13_ITEM7_P84_S6	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in its effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	The Company reports interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes.
714603_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's operating results (millions, except per share amounts):
714603_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	increased $60.2 million or 2.6% during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to December 31, 2010.
714603_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	Consolidated operating revenues increased $148.4 million or 8.5% in 2012 as compared to 2011 and increased $30.4 million or 1.8% in 2011 as compared to 2010.
714603_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	Financial Services Segment operating revenue increased $105.6 million during 2012, of which, $81.8 million is attributable to the inclusion of a full year of ALPS operations in 2012 versus two months in 2011.
714603_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	The remaining increase in Financial Services revenue from 2011 to 2012 is primarily from increased DST Healthcare revenues as a result of higher pharmacy claims processed and a full year of operations from businesses acquired during 2011.
714603_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	These operating revenue increases were partially offset by lower operating revenues for mutual fund processing resulting from lower registered accounts serviced.
714603_13_ITEM7_P88_S3	The $40.2 million increase in Customer Communications Segment operating revenue in 2012 is the result of a full year of operations from the 2011 acquisitions of Lateral in the U.K. (acquired on August 2, 2011) and Newkirk (acquired on May 2, 2011) in North America, as well as new client volumes in North America, offset by decreased demand and lower revenues per package in the U.K.
714603_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Consolidated operating revenues increased during 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of an increase in Customer Communications Segment revenues of $45.7 million, which was partially offset by an $18.3 million decrease in Financial Services Segment revenues.
714603_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	In 2011, the Company received a $3.5 million contract termination payment from a subaccounting client.
714603_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	In 2010, the Company received a contract termination payment of $10.4 million from a subaccounting broker/dealer client ($9.1 million in the Financial Services Segment and $1.3 million in Customer Communications Segment).
714603_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	In addition, a Customer Communications telecommunications client, representing approximately 6.6% of 2009 annual Customer Communications operating revenues, terminated its contract and internalized bill production processing in April 2010, which resulted in a contract termination payment to the Company of approximately $63.0 million.
714603_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Excluding the contract termination payments mentioned above from 2011 and 2010, consolidated operating revenues for 2011 increased $100.3 million or 6.1% as compared to 2010.
714603_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	On this basis, Customer Communications operating revenues increased $110.0 million or 22.0% and Financial Services operating revenues decreased $12.7 million or 1.1% during 2011 as compared to 2010.
714603_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	The increase in Customer Communications is attributable to operating revenues from the acquisitions of Lateral on August 5, 2011, Newkirk on May 2, 2011 and a full year of operating revenues from dsicmm Group, which was acquired on July 30, 2010, partially offset by the loss of revenues from the telecommunications and subaccounting clients that terminated their processing contracts in mid-2010.
714603_13_ITEM7_P91_S3	The decrease in Financial Services results is from lower mutual fund shareowner processing revenues and lower DST Health Solutions processing revenues, partially offset by operating revenues from the acquisitions of ALPS on October 31, 2011, which contributed $14.6 million of revenues, revenues from other 2011 Financial Services business acquisitions (Intellisource, Subserveo, Finix and Converge) and higher DST Global Solutions operating revenues.
714603_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Consolidated OOP reimbursements increased $39.5 million or 6.1% in 2012 as compared to 2011 and increased $29.8 million or 4.8% in 2011 as compared to 2010.
714603_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	The net increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2012 in the Customer Communications Segment of $29.7 million is attributable to higher volumes from new clients and a full year of volumes from Lateral and Newkirk.
714603_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	The net increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2012 in the Financial Services Segment of $12.7 million is from the inclusion of a full year of ALPS operations.
714603_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	The net increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2011 was primarily from a $31.2 million increase in the Customer Communications Segment associated with the acquisitions of dsicmm, Lateral and Newkirk.
714603_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Consolidated income from operations decreased $102.8 million or 39.5% to $157.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011 and decreased $84.5 million or 24.5% to $260.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010.
714603_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	The $102.8 million decrease in consolidated income from operations in 2012 is the result of declines of $28.8 million in the Financial Services Segment, $56.8 million in the Customer Communications Segment and $17.2 million in the Investments and Other Segment.
714603_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	The $84.5 million decrease in consolidated income from operations in 2011 is primarily attributable to declines of $35.7 million in Financial Services and $57.6 million in Customer Communications, both as compared to 2010.
714603_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	U.S. income from operations decreased $44.1 million or 16.1% as compared to 2011 and decreased $69.7 million or 20.3% in 2011 as compared to 2010.
714603_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	International income from operations decreased $58.7 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 and increased $14.8 million in 2011 as compared to 2010.
714603_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	The following items negatively affected consolidated income from operations in 2012: non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $60.8 million in the Customer Communications Segment, $11.0 million of leased facility abandonment costs (of which $9.2 million were in the Customer Communications Segment and the remainder in the Investments and Other Segment) and net losses of $7.1 million on real estate assets (mostly from impairments recorded in the Investments and Other Segments), $11.0 million of costs associated with a charitable donation of appreciated marketable securities by the Investments and Other Segment, increased employee termination costs of $10.9 million (mostly in the Financial Services Segment) and $9.1 million of costs associated with the discontinuation of the insurance processing solution for the insurance market.
714603_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	Additionally, $7.3 million of restructuring costs were incurred in 2011 to amend a sales / marketing agreement from an acquired business, which did not recur in 2012.
714603_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	DST tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 and at other times if a significant change in circumstances indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced.
714603_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	The valuation of goodwill requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows, market multiples and discount rates.
714603_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	The decreased demand resulting from current economic conditions in the U.K. economy has negatively impacted production volumes and operating revenues in the U.K. Previously anticipated new clients and U.K. economic events resulted in expected improvements in long-term U.K. revenue projections through the third quarter of 2012.
714603_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	The anticipated revenue from these events did not ultimately materialize.
714603_13_ITEM7_P98_S2	Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2012, the expectations for the U.K. economic recovery were delayed beyond previous estimates.
714603_13_ITEM7_P98_S3	As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2012, DST adjusted its future outlook and related strategy with respect to the Customer Communications U.K. operations which resulted in a reduction in future expected cash flows.
714603_13_ITEM7_P98_S4	Based upon these revised future cash flow projections, the goodwill impairment test indicated that the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value.
714603_13_ITEM7_P98_S5	Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $60.8 million in the Customer Communications Segment during 2012.
714603_13_ITEM7_P98_S6	No tax benefit was recognized for this impairment charge.
714603_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	Remaining goodwill and net intangible assets in the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit at December 31, 2012 are $7.6 million and $27.6 million, respectively.
714603_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	The fair value of the Company's reporting unit, from a market participant's perspective, was estimated utilizing a cash flow projection derived from the Company's long-range strategic plan.
714603_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	The assumptions, inputs and judgments used in performing the valuation analysis are inherently subjective and reflect estimates based on known facts and circumstances at the time the valuation is performed.
714603_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	The estimates and assumptions utilized for the impairment analysis of the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate of 15% derived from the weighted average cost of capital, long-term estimated growth rate in cash flows of 2% which was based on the long-term projected rate of inflation, and capital expenditures forecasts.
714603_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	results of the income approach described above, the fair value of the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit was also estimated using the guideline company method, a variation of the market approach.
714603_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	Additionally, in connection with the calculation of the goodwill impairment charge, the fair value of all the assets and liabilities on the reporting unit's balance sheet was determined.
714603_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	In order to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit's intangible assets, the Company utilized a combination of the excess earnings model for existing customer relationships and the relief from royalty method for trade names and technology.
714603_13_ITEM7_P102_S3	The more significant estimates in determining the value of customer relationships included customer retention rates, growth of existing customers and gross margin.
714603_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	The use of different assumptions, inputs and judgments, or changes in circumstances, could materially affect the results of the valuation.
714603_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	As described in the consolidated revenues section above, the Company received client contract termination payments in both 2011 and 2010 resulting from clients early terminating their processing agreements.
714603_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	The favorable increase to income from operations, net of operating costs incurred in connection with the contract termination, was $2.0 million in 2011 (Financial Services Segment) and $67.2 million in 2010 ($7.5 million in Financial Services and $59.7 million in Customer Communications).
714603_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	In addition, the Company incurred employee termination expenses during 2011 and 2010 to restructure and reduce its workforce, which reduced income from operations.
714603_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	Costs associated with these employee termination actions in 2011 were $6.4 million ($1.3 million in Financial Services and $5.1 million in Customer Communications) and $20.9 million in 2010 ($14.3 million in Financial Services and $6.6 million in Customer Communications).
714603_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	In 2011, the Financial Services Segment incurred $7.3 million of costs to amend and restructure a sales / marketing agreement of an acquired business, which decreased income from operations.
714603_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	In 2011, the Company incurred business development expenses such as legal, accounting, investment banking and other professional fees to complete the 2011 business acquisitions of $3.3 million ($3.1 million in Financial Services and $0.2 million in Customer Communications), which reduced income from operations.
714603_13_ITEM7_P105_S2	The Financial Services Segment incurred $1.8 million of business advisory expenses in 2011, which decreased income from operations, associated with the DST Board of Directors retaining advisors to assist the Board with its ongoing review of DST's business plan, assets and investment portfolio.
714603_13_ITEM7_P105_S3	In 2011, the Company recorded a $3.5 million loss accrual associated with a regulatory inquiry regarding the processing of certain pharmacy claims during 2006 to 2009, which decreased income from operations.
714603_13_ITEM7_P105_S4	In 2010, the Investments and Other Segment incurred $10.2 million of costs associated with a charitable donation of appreciated marketable securities, which decreased income from operations.
714603_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	Interest expense was $43.5 million, $46.5 million and $46.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
714603_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	Interest expense decreased during 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily from lower weighted average debt balances outstanding, partially offset by a full year of interest expense on debt related to 2011 acquisitions.
714603_13_ITEM7_P106_S2	Interest expense increased during 2011 as compared to 2010 from a full year of interest expense on debt assumed in the acquisition of dsicmm on July 30, 2010, a new $125.0 million term loan facility used to complete the ALPS acquisition on October 31, 2011, higher weighted average interest rates from the Company's privately placed senior notes issued in August 2010 that were used to repurchase senior convertible debentures and higher debt amounts outstanding at Output U.K. associated with the issuance of new debt in 2011 and debt assumed in the Lateral acquisition, partially offset by lower weighted average amounts outstanding in the U.S. and lower interest rates on the Company's revolving credit agreements and accounts receivable securitization program, which were amended in April 2011 and May 2011, respectively.
714603_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	The components of other income (expense) are as follows (in millions):
714603_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	Included in the $148.1 million of net realized gains from the disposition of available for sale securities during 2012 are gains of $53.6 million from the sale of approximately 15.0 million shares of Computershare Ltd., $38.0 million from the sale of 0.8 million shares and disposition of 0.2 million shares through a charitable contribution of State Street Corporation and $31.3 million from the sale of 1.9 million shares of Euronet Worldwide.
714603_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	Included in the $67.0 million of net realized gains during 2010 is a $42.5 million gain from the disposition of approximately 7.3 million shares of Computershare Ltd and $24.5 million of net realized gains from the disposition of other securities.
714603_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	The Company recorded investment impairment charges for available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized holding losses resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary of $2.4 million, $3.8 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
714603_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	The Company recorded a net gain on private equity funds and other investments of $9.3 million and $5.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2010, respectively, and recorded a net loss of $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011.

714603_13_ITEM7_P110_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment's current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on the Company's financial position.
714603_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	The Company recorded $1.2 million and $6.4 million in net losses on the repurchase and extinguishment of senior convertible debentures during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
714603_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	The Company recorded a gain of $138.7 million on the sale of a portion of its shares in a privately-held company investment during the year ended December 31, 2012.
714603_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	The Company also received cash dividends of $48.4 million and $54.7 million from a private company investment during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2010, respectively.
714603_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	The gross amount of the cash dividends for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $57.7 million, but approximately $3.0 million of the dividend was applied to the Company's cost basis investment.
714603_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	The Company receives dividend income from certain investments held.
714603_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	Dividends from State Street common stock were $9.6 million, $7.4 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
714603_13_ITEM7_P113_S2	State Street Corporation quarterly dividend per common share was $0.01 per share in 2010, and then increased to $0.18 per share in 2011, and had a further increase to $0.24 in 2012.

714603_13_ITEM7_P154_S3	On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses is attributable to foreign currency exchange effects between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies which increased costs by approximately $9.8 million, start-up costs from DST Insurance Solutions, increased investments in DST Retirement Solutions and DST Brokerage Solutions (including Subserveo, Finix and Converge) and operating costs related to 2011 business acquisitions and new service offerings, partially offset by lower deferred compensation costs of $3.8 million (the effect of which is offset in other non-operating income) and lower employee healthcare and retirement benefit costs.

714603_13_ITEM7_P155_S1	Depending on the arrangement, ALPS may earn distribution fees for marketing and selling the underlying fund shares.
714603_13_ITEM7_P155_S2	Conversely, ALPS may incur distribution expenses, including structuring fees, finders' fees and referral fees paid to unaffiliated broker-dealers or introducing parties for marketing and selling underlying fund shares of a closed-end fund sponsored by ALPS.
714603_13_ITEM7_P155_S3	While distribution revenues and expenses are not significant percentages of DST's operating revenues or costs and expenses, they can significantly impact operations and earnings in the period in which they are recognized.

714603_13_ITEM7_P156_S1	The increase in 2012 is primarily the result of $8.0 million of higher amortization expense from intangible assets resulting from a full year of amortization during 2012 from the businesses acquired in 2011 and $5.8 million of asset impairment charges associated with ceasing the development of an insurance processing solution, partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization from DST Health Solutions as certain assets became fully amortized during 2011.

714603_13_ITEM7_P157_S1	The decrease in depreciation and amortization is attributable to lower intangible amortization from certain assets becoming fully depreciated/amortized, partially offset by depreciation from new asset additions and intangible asset amortization expense associated with ALPS and other 2011 Financial Services Segment acquisitions of $2.8 million.
714603_13_ITEM7_P158_S0	Financial Services Segment income from operations for 2012 was $209.1 million, a decrease of $28.8 million or 12.1% as compared to 2011.
714603_13_ITEM7_P158_S1	The decrease in Financial Services income from operations is from lower contributions from mutual fund shareowner account processing, higher costs associated with new business initiatives (retirement and brokerage), higher employee termination costs, increased intangible asset amortization expense from 2011 acquisitions, higher employee compensation plan costs associated with higher earnings in 2012, partially offset by contributions from the inclusion of ALPS and increased earnings from DST Healthcare.

714603_13_ITEM7_P159_S2	On this basis, the decrease in Financial Services income from operations is attributable to lower mutual fund servicing revenues and higher costs associated with new business initiatives, partially offset by lower deferred compensation costs of $3.8 million (the effect of which is offset as unrealized appreciation on trading securities in other income, net).

714603_13_ITEM7_P190_S0	In addition to reporting operating income, pretax income, net income, net income attributable to DST Systems, Inc. ("DST Earnings") and earnings per share on a GAAP basis, DST has also made certain non-GAAP adjustments which are described below in the section titled "Description of Non-GAAP Adjustments" and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the attached financial schedules titled "Reconciliation of Reported Results to Income Adjusted for Certain Non-GAAP Items" below.
714603_13_ITEM7_P190_S1	In making these non-GAAP adjustments, the Company takes into account the impact of items that are not necessarily ongoing in nature, that do not have a high level of predictability associated with them or that are non-operational in nature.
714603_13_ITEM7_P190_S2	Generally, these items include net gains on dispositions of business units, net gains (losses) associated with securities and other investments, restructuring and impairment costs and other similar items.
714603_13_ITEM7_P190_S3	Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a useful basis for evaluating underlying business unit performance, but should not be considered in isolation and is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, evaluating business unit performance utilizing GAAP financial information.
714603_13_ITEM7_P190_S4	Management uses non-GAAP measures in its budgeting and forecasting processes and to further analyze its financial trends and "operational run-rate," as well as making financial comparisons to prior periods presented on a similar basis.

714603_13_ITEM7_P191_S0	DST's management uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures in its own evaluation of the Company's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods.
714603_13_ITEM7_P191_S1	DST's non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.
714603_13_ITEM7_P191_S2	Although DST's management believes non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, DST acknowledges that items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on the Company's income from operations, pretax income, net income, net income attributable to DST Systems, Inc. and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.
714603_13_ITEM7_P191_S3	Therefore, management typically uses Non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP results.

714603_13_ITEM7_P225_S6	These working capital decreases were partially offset by increases in income taxes payable during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the 2011, attributable to the timing of tax payments on 2012 investment sales.
714603_13_ITEM7_P226_S0	Operating cash flows during 2012 resulted principally from net income of $324.0 million, changes in working capital described above and adjustments for non-cash items included in the determination of net income including depreciation and amortization expense (including goodwill impairment) of $216.4 million, amortization of share-based compensation of $25.5 million and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $32.2 million.

714603_13_ITEM7_P227_S4	Cash flows after January 1, 2010 associated with the accounts receivable securitization program are presented as financing activities.
714603_13_ITEM7_P228_S0	On this basis, the decrease in operating cash flows during 2011 is attributable to lower earnings in 2011, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $38.3 million, mostly attributable to the receipt of $40.0 million from BFDS in 2011 as a partial prepayment of processing services to be provided by DST in 2012.
714603_13_ITEM7_P228_S1	Contributing to the decrease in net income for 2011 were the absence of significant contract termination payments received in 2010 of approximately $73.4 million ($64.3 million in Customer Communications and $9.1 million in Financial Services) and $57.7 million of cash dividends received in 2010 from a private equity investment.

714603_13_ITEM7_P229_S3	On this basis, the increase in operating cash flows during 2010 is attributable to higher earnings in 2010 and decreases in working capital.
714603_13_ITEM7_P229_S4	Contributing to the increase in net income for 2010 were contract termination payments and the private equity investment dividend mentioned above.

714603_13_ITEM7_P232_S0	The $53.0 million increase in investing activities during 2011 as compared to 2010 is attributable to higher cash outflows for acquisitions of businesses in 2011 of $365.4 million as compared to $7.8 million in 2010, an increase of $357.6 million, and higher cash outflows for net investment securities activities as investment purchases exceeded proceeds received from investment sales by $49.4 million during 2011 as compared to $8.7 million in 2010.

714603_13_ITEM7_P272_S1	A dollar offset ratio of between 0.80 and 1.25 is required in order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
714603_13_ITEM7_P272_S2	At inception of the hedge, the cumulative dollar offset ratio is 1.00 since the terms of the perfect hypothetical swap match those of the actual swap.
714603_13_ITEM7_P272_S3	The derivative accounting guidance indicates that hedge effectiveness occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows of the hedged transaction.
714603_13_ITEM7_P273_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of the Company's pay-fixed, receive-variable, forward starting interest rate swap was a liability of $2.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_13_ITEM7_P273_S1	The Company determined there was no ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, which resulted in the changes in fair value of this swap being recorded in other comprehensive income.

714603_13_ITEM8_P146_S0	DST tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 and at other times if a significant change in circumstances indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced.
714603_13_ITEM8_P147_S0	The valuation of goodwill requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows, market multiples and discount rates.
714603_13_ITEM8_P148_S0	The decreased demand resulting from current economic conditions in the U.K. economy has negatively impacted production volumes and operating revenues in the U.K. Previously anticipated new clients and U.K. economic events resulted in expected improvements in long-term U.K. revenue projections through the third quarter of 2012.
714603_13_ITEM8_P148_S1	The anticipated revenue from these events did not ultimately materialize.
714603_13_ITEM8_P148_S2	Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2012, the expectations for the U.K. economic recovery were delayed beyond previous estimates.
714603_13_ITEM8_P148_S3	As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2012, DST adjusted its future outlook and related strategy with respect to the Customer Communications U.K. operations which resulted in a reduction in future expected cash flows.
714603_13_ITEM8_P148_S4	Based upon these revised future cash flow projections, the goodwill impairment test indicated that the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value.
714603_13_ITEM8_P148_S5	Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $60.8 million in the Customer Communications Segment during 2012.
714603_13_ITEM8_P148_S6	No tax benefit was recognized for this impairment charge.
714603_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	Remaining goodwill and net intangible assets in the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit at December 31, 2012 are $7.6 million and $27.6 million, respectively.
714603_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	The fair value of the Company's reporting unit, from a market participant's perspective, was estimated utilizing a cash flow projection derived from the Company's long-range strategic plan.
714603_13_ITEM8_P151_S0	The assumptions, inputs and judgments used in performing the valuation analysis are inherently subjective and reflect estimates based on known facts and circumstances at the time the valuation is performed.
714603_13_ITEM8_P151_S1	The estimates and assumptions utilized for the impairment analysis of the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate of 15% derived from the weighted average cost of capital, long-term estimated growth rate in cash flows of 2% which was based on the long-term projected rate of inflation, and capital expenditures forecasts.
714603_13_ITEM8_P152_S0	To corroborate the results of the income approach described above, the fair value of the Customer Communications U.K.
714603_13_ITEM8_P153_S0	reporting unit was also estimated using the guideline company method, a variation of the market approach.
714603_13_ITEM8_P153_S1	Additionally, in connection with the calculation of the goodwill impairment charge, the fair value of all the assets and liabilities on the reporting unit's balance sheet was determined.
714603_13_ITEM8_P153_S2	In order to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit's intangible assets, the Company utilized a combination of the excess earnings model for existing customer relationships and the relief from royalty method for trade names and technology.
714603_13_ITEM8_P153_S3	The more significant estimates in determining the value of customer relationships included customer retention rates, growth of existing customers and gross margin.
714603_13_ITEM8_P154_S0	The use of different assumptions, inputs and judgments, or changes in circumstances, could materially affect the results of the valuation.
714603_13_ITEM8_P155_S0	The Company is obligated under notes and other indebtedness as follows (in millions):
714603_13_ITEM8_P156_S0	DST securitizes certain of its domestic accounts receivable through an accounts receivable securitization program with a third-party bank.

714603_13_ITEM8_P157_S1	DST retains servicing responsibility over the receivables.
714603_13_ITEM8_P158_S0	The program contains customary restrictive covenants as well as customary events of default.
714603_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	DST has continuing involvement with the transferred assets because it maintains servicing responsibilities for the accounts receivable assets included in the accounts receivable securitization program.
714603_13_ITEM8_P160_S0	Accounts receivable assets transferred from DST and certain of its domestic subsidiaries to its wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary contain restrictions because they are not available to satisfy the creditors of any other person, including DST or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.
714603_13_ITEM8_P160_S1	Further, neither DST nor the SPE guarantees collectability of the receivables or the creditworthiness of obligors.
714603_13_ITEM8_P160_S2	The SPE retains an interest in the receivables in excess of the amount transferred to the conduit, and such receivables will continue to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_13_ITEM8_P160_S3	The carrying value of the retained interest approximates its estimated fair value at the balance sheet date.
714603_13_ITEM8_P160_S4	The Company believes increases in the level of assumed interest rates and/or credit losses compared to assumptions in effect at the balance sheet date by 10% or 20% would not materially affect the fair value of the retained interest at the reporting date.

714603_13_ITEM8_P161_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company's accounts receivable increased by $125.0 million (resulting in a cash outflow being reported in the operating section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows), and the current portion of debt associated with the accounts receivable securitization program increased by $125.0 million (resulting in a cash inflow being reported in the financing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows).
714603_13_ITEM8_P161_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 total proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program were approximately $917.4 million, $924.1 million and $915.4 million and total repayments were approximately $917.4 million, $914.1 million and $915.4 million, respectively, which comprise the net cash flow in the financing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_13_ITEM8_P162_S0	Aggregate transfers of undivided interests in the receivables from the SPE to the bank were $1,665.7 million and $1,720.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
714603_13_ITEM8_P162_S1	The impact on net income stemming from these transfers was not material.
714603_13_ITEM8_P163_S0	Costs associated with the accounts receivable securitization program are included in interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

714603_13_ITEM8_P215_S2	Since these net operating losses were generated by an entity prior to its acquisition by DST, their utilization is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
714603_13_ITEM8_P215_S3	The Company does not anticipate that such limitations will prohibit the utilization of the federal net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration.

714603_13_ITEM8_P218_S2	Through December 31, 2012, the cumulative amount of such unremitted earnings was $210.2 million.
714603_13_ITEM8_P218_S3	These amounts would become taxable to the Company if distributed by the affiliates as dividends, in which case the Company would be entitled to the dividends received deduction for 80% of the dividends; alternatively, these earnings could be realized by the sale of the affiliates' stock, which would give rise to tax at federal capital gains rates and state ordinary income tax rates, to the extent the stock sale proceeds exceeded the Company's tax basis.

714603_13_ITEM8_P219_S4	As a consequence, no federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided for amounts which would become payable, if any, on the distribution of such earnings.
714603_13_ITEM8_P220_S0	may be able to offset, at least in part, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such a distribution with foreign income tax credits which would become creditable as a result of such a distribution.

714603_13_ITEM8_P261_S2	Future amortization is not projected on approximately $7.8 million of unrecognized compensation expense as the related awards are not currently expected to achieve their required performance features and therefore are not expected to vest.
714603_13_ITEM8_P262_S0	Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") provides the right to subscribe to 2.0 million shares of common stock to substantially all employees of the Company and participating subsidiaries, except those whose customary employment is less than 20 hours per week or is five months or less per calendar year, or those who are 5% or greater stockholders of DST.
714603_13_ITEM8_P262_S1	The purchase price for shares under any stock offering is to be 85% of the average market price on either the exercise date or the offering date, whichever is lower.

714603_13_ITEM8_P265_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Rights Plan, each share of the Company's outstanding common stock has received one Right (as defined in the Rights Plan).
714603_13_ITEM8_P265_S1	Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company 1/1000ths of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, or in some circumstances, shares of the Company's Common Stock, other securities, cash or other assets, at a purchase price of $225 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
714603_13_ITEM8_P265_S2	In the event a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Plan), the Rights will entitle each holder of a Right to purchase, for the purchase price, that number of common shares equivalent to the number of common shares which at the time of the transaction would have a market value of twice the purchase price.
714603_13_ITEM8_P265_S3	Any Rights that are at any time beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Plan) will be null and void and nontransferable and any holder of any such Right will be unable to exercise or transfer any such Right.
714603_13_ITEM8_P265_S4	At any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, but before a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the common shares, the Board of Directors may elect to exchange each Right for consideration per Right consisting of one-half of the number of common shares that would be issuable at such time on the exercise of one Right and without payment of the purchase price.
714603_13_ITEM8_P265_S5	Under certain circumstances, the Company may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price of $0.0025 per Right.
714603_13_ITEM8_P266_S0	The Rights, which are automatically attached to common stock, are not exercisable or transferable separately from shares of common stock until upon the earlier of (i) ten (10) business days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons, together with any person acting in concert therewith, has acquired beneficial ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock (as defined in greater detail in the Rights Plan); or (ii) ten (10) business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Plan), unless the Board of Directors sets a later date in either event.
714603_13_ITEM8_P267_S0	The Rights Plan is intended to encourage a potential acquiring person to negotiate directly with the Board of Directors, but may have certain anti-takeover effects.
714603_13_ITEM8_P267_S1	The Rights Plan could significantly dilute the interests in the Company of an Acquiring Person.
714603_13_ITEM8_P267_S2	The Rights Plan may therefore have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of the Company.

714603_13_ITEM8_P271_S2	Deferred amounts earn interest at a rate determined by the Board of Directors or are credited with deemed gains or losses of the underlying hypothetical investments.
714603_13_ITEM8_P271_S3	Amounts deferred under these plans were approximately $46.4 million and $35.2 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

714603_13_ITEM8_P280_S0	The regulator has broad statutory authority in determining the resolution of the inquiry.
714603_13_ITEM8_P280_S1	There can be no assurance that the loss accrual will be sufficient to resolve the matter.
714603_13_ITEM8_P280_S2	Although the ultimate resolution and impact of this inquiry is not presently determinable, the Company's management believes the eventual outcome of such inquiry will not have a material adverse effect on the overall financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

714603_13_ITEM8_P281_S1	Although the software was never completed, the counterparty to the agreement has asserted that DST's failure to accept the software has resulted in damages ranging up to approximately $10 million.
714603_13_ITEM8_P281_S2	A District Court and a Court of Appeals each concluded in 2004 and 2006, respectively, that the conditions for acceptance were not met.
714603_13_ITEM8_P281_S3	In October 2011, a Court of Appeals ruled that the parties need to engage an expert to decide whether the software met the acceptance criteria.

714603_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Mutual fund product proliferation, combined with growing state and federal regulations, has increased the volume of transactions and the complexity of recordkeeping.
714603_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	In addition, new technologies have changed the service requirements and distribution channels of the mutual fund market.
714603_14_ITEM1_P16_S4	The Company has made significant investments in computer capacities and systems functionality to handle the increasing marketplace demands in order to maintain its market position and to improve quality and productivity.
714603_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Most of the Company's clients who utilize the shareowner recordkeeping platform are open-end mutual fund companies, which obtain funds for investment by making a continuous offering of their shares.
714603_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	The proprietary system application for shareowner recordkeeping is TA2000.

714603_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Full service processing, or Business Process Outsourcing ( BPO ), includes all necessary administrative and clerical support to process and maintain shareowner records, reconciling cash and share activity, answering inquiries from shareowners, brokers and others, and handling the TA2000 processing functions described above.
714603_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	In addition, full service mutual fund transfer agency clients may elect to have their end of day available client bank balances invested overnight by and in the name of the Company into money market funds or other similar overnight investment alternatives.

714603_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Shared service processing enables clients to select the administrative functions to be handled by both client personnel and the Company.
714603_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	This service is facilitated by the use of Automated Work Distributor ( AWD ), DST's proprietary business process management and customer contact system.
714603_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Company's shareowner recordkeeping business derives revenues from fees which are generally charged based on a per account and number of funds basis for system processing services and on a per account, number of funds and transaction basis for clerical services.

714603_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	The Company's policy is not to license TA2000.
714603_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	The Company also derives revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in the Company's full service transfer agency bank accounts.
714603_14_ITEM1_P21_S4	Accounts serviced under shareowner recordkeeping arrangements with the mutual fund and alternative investment sponsors are referred to as registered accounts.
714603_14_ITEM1_P21_S5	This distinguishes these accounts from broker subaccounts, which are serviced under contract with a broker/dealer.
714603_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Registered accounts include both tax-advantaged and non tax-advantaged accounts on the books of the transfer agent.
714603_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	At December 31, 2013 , the Company provided shareowner recordkeeping services for approximately 71.2 million registered accounts (both tax-advantaged and non-tax advantaged accounts).

714603_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Distribution Support Solutions The Company offers products designed to assist clients in meeting the expanding needs associated with distributing U.S. investment products through financial intermediaries.
714603_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	The array of solutions supporting distribution of investment products is expanding to address regulatory, service and information needs of the financial services industry.
714603_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Certain products are paid by investment managers and certain products are paid by the distributor.
714603_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	The two primary distribution support solutions offered are DST Vision and Financial Advisor Network Mail ( FAN Mail ).
714603_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	DST Vision is an aggregating website designed exclusively for financial advisors and broker/dealer back-office operations.
714603_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	The site enables mutual fund companies, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and variable annuity companies to reduce operational expense by replacing costly support phone calls from intermediaries with web-based self-servicing.
714603_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	financial advisors access to approximately 475 participating investment product manufacturers, DST Vision is an industry leading source of customer information.
714603_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Having access to consolidated account information across all of an investor's product relationships provides significant customer support efficiencies to the financial intermediaries' operations.
714603_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Advisors can also utilize portfolio management tools, access electronic shareholder statements, and initiate transaction processing.
714603_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	DST Vision charges are paid by the product companies through a combination of user access charges and activity-related fees.
714603_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	The Company also provides additional services to advisors affiliated with independent broker/dealers.

714603_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	With participation from more than 260 product manufacturers, FAN Mail is one of the industries' most comprehensive sources of investor account detail and transactional information.
714603_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	FAN Mail charges are paid by the product companies based on the volume of account and transaction records delivered to the underlying intermediary.
714603_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	While Vision and FAN Mail largely service the same audience, there are distinct reasons an intermediary would use one or both products.
714603_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Vision, as a website, is designed to provide a real-time view of the underlying recordkeeping detail and is frequently used to resolve operations-based servicing issues or to execute transactions or perform account maintenance.
714603_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	FAN Mail is used by intermediaries that need to take possession of the data to source proprietary software applications.
714603_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	Consequently, almost all FAN Mail users also use Vision.
714603_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	The Company also offers a variety of other solutions to mutual fund companies, including Omnibus Transparency and SalesConnect.
714603_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Omnibus Transparency offers a solution that provides mutual fund companies the ability to request and receive supplemental trade data from intermediaries for compliance with Rule 22c-2 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

714603_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	The Company believes the defined contribution market is a significant growth opportunity for its services and products because (i) that market continues to experience significant expansion as more employers shift away from defined benefit programs, (ii) the federal government has policies that encourage, and the retirement plan industry has a strong desire to expand, coverage to include the estimated 95.0 million Americans not participating in a retirement savings program today, and (iii) potential participation is likely to increase as retirement plan sponsors adopt auto enrollment and guaranteed income features for new employees, and a relatively small percentage of plan providers utilize processing service arrangements and instead process on licensed software which the Company believes is less flexible and more expensive.

714603_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

714603_14_ITEM1A_P3_S5	If demand for our products decreases or any of the industries we serve decline or fail or consolidate, reducing the number of potential clients, our business and our operating results could be adversely affected.

714603_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our mutual fund clients may decide to allow a broker/dealer who has assisted with the purchase or sale of mutual fund shares to perform subaccounting services.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A brokerage firm typically maintains an omnibus account with the fund's transfer agent that represents the aggregate number of shares of a mutual fund owned by the brokerage firm's customers.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The omnibus account structure results in fewer mutual fund shareowner accounts on our systems, which adversely affects our revenues.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We offer subaccounting services to brokerage firms that perform mutual fund shareowner subaccounting.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As the recordkeeping functions in connection with subaccounting are more limited than traditional shareowner accounting, the fees charged are generally lower on a per unit basis.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Brokerage firms that obtain agreements from our mutual fund clients to use an omnibus accounting structure cause accounts currently on our traditional recordkeeping system to convert to our subaccounting system, or to the subaccounting systems of other service providers, which generally results in lower revenues.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The demand for our products and services could decrease if we do not continually address our clients' technology and capacity requirements.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our clients use technology-based products and services in the complex and rapidly changing markets in which they operate.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We must substantially invest in technology and systems to meet customer requirements for technology and capacity.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we do not meet clients' technology and capacity requirements in advance of our competitors or if the investments we make are not cost-effective or do not result in successful products or services, our business could be adversely affected.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The quality or availability of postal system services could decrease, reducing the volume of printed customer communications and negatively impacting our business.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company is dependent on postal delivery systems for final delivery of printed customer communications.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Postal delivery systems are facing economic pressures from the reduction in first class mail and certain postal delivery systems have experienced work stoppages and other interruptions.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Accuracy and speed of delivery are important factors for clients using printed communications in their businesses.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Changes in the timeliness and quality of postal delivery could negatively impact the level of printed communications delivered by our customers to their clients.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	A decrease in such communications could adversely affect our business and our operating results.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Decreased demand for traditional printed and mailed communications may adversely affect our business, depending on the extent to which our customers' and their clients' acceptance of electronic alternatives continues to grow.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	To the extent clients' customers select electronic presentment and delivery of communications, the demand for our services for production and distribution of printed documents could decrease.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We provide electronic presentment and delivery solutions, but they are priced differently and require different capabilities than print-mail solutions.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Customers may choose to perform electronic hosting and distribution of communications to customers internally or select electronic solution providers other than the Company, which could adversely affect our business and our operating results.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Damage to our facilities or declining real estate values could impact our operations or financial condition.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We own, lease and manage real estate as part of our business.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The performance of our services also depends upon facilities that house central computer operations or operating centers or in which we process information, images, bills or statements.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Declining property values in the markets in which we own investment properties may adversely affect our financial condition.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Significant damage to any of our operating facilities could interrupt the operations at those facilities and interfere with our ability to serve customers.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We may be unable to attract and retain capable technical personnel for our processing businesses or quality executives to manage the complex structure of our business.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our success depends on recruiting and retaining adept management and personnel with expertise in software and systems development and the types of computer hardware and software we utilize.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	If we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel, our operations could be materially adversely affected.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Companies in our industry compete fiercely for qualified management and technical personnel.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S6	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately compete for or keep qualified personnel.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S7	If we lack qualified management, there is an increased risk that the Company will adopt unfavorable business strategies, especially in a complex business like ours with multiple segments and operating entities.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S8	If we lack qualified technical personnel, our ability to develop the systems and services our clients demand may also be negatively affected.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Our businesses are subject to substantial competition.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S10	We are subject to intense competition from other established service providers in all industries we serve.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S11	Some of our competitors are able to bundle service offerings and offer more appealing pricing structures.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S12	Some of our clients, or the clients they serve, may develop, have developed or are developing the in-house capacity to perform the transaction processing, recordkeeping and output services they have paid us to perform.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S13	Additionally, some of our competitors and clients have greater financial and human resources and access to capital than we do.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S14	Our failure to successfully compete in any of our material operating businesses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P12_S15	Competition could also affect the revenue mix of services we provide, resulting in decreased revenues in lines of business with higher profit margins.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We and our unconsolidated affiliates are subject to government regulation.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Any regulatory violations, changes or uncertainties could adversely affect our business.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	A number of our businesses are subject to U.S. or foreign regulation, including privacy, licensing, processing, recordkeeping, investment adviser, broker/dealer, reporting and related regulations.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Such regulations cover all aspects of our businesses including, but not limited to, sales and trading methods, trade practices among broker/dealers, use and safekeeping of customers' funds and securities, capital structure of securities firms, net capital, anti-money laundering efforts, record keeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Any violation of applicable regulations could expose us or those businesses to civil or criminal liability, significant fines or sanctions or damage our reputation, the revocation of the licenses, censures, fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, which could adversely affect our business or our financial results.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Governmental changes and uncertainties surrounding services we provide could increase our costs of business or diminish business, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Our clients are subject to government regulation that could affect our business.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Our clients are subject to extensive government regulation, including investment adviser, broker/dealer and privacy regulations applicable to services we provide to the financial services industry and insurance, privacy and other regulations applicable to services we provide to the healthcare industry.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S8	Changes in, and any violation by our clients of, applicable laws and regulations (whether related to the services we provide or otherwise) could diminish their business or financial condition and thus their demand for our products and services or could increase our cost of continuing to provide services to such industries.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S9	Demand could also decrease if we do not continue to offer products and services that help our clients comply with regulations.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S10	We operate internationally and are thus exposed to foreign political, economic and other conditions that could adversely affect our revenues from or support by foreign operations.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S11	Revenues from our subsidiaries in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and elsewhere outside the U.S. are an important element of our revenues.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S12	Inherent risks in our international business activities could decrease our international sales and have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S13	These risks include potentially unfavorable foreign economic conditions, political conditions or national priorities, foreign government regulation, potential expropriation of assets by foreign governments, the failure to bridge cultural differences, and limited or prohibited access to our foreign operations and the support they provide.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P13_S14	We may also have difficulty repatriating profits or be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations in our international business.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Various events may cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter or year to year.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The nature of these events might inhibit our ability to anticipate and act in advance to counter them.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We may be unsuccessful in determining or controlling when and whether events occur that could cause varying financial results.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Unfavorable results may occur that we did not anticipate or take advance action to address.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	The various reasons our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate include unanticipated economic conditions, and costs for starting up significant client operations, for hiring staff, and for developing products.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Our results may also vary as a result of pricing pressures, increased cost of supplies, timing of license fees, the evolving and unpredictable markets in which our products and services are sold, changes in accounting principles, and competitors' new products or services.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Investment decisions with respect to cash balances, market returns or losses on those investments, and limits on insurance applicable to cash balances held in bank and brokerage accounts, including as agent on behalf of our clients, could expose us to losses of such cash balances and adversely affect revenues attributable to cash balance deposit investments.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As part of our transaction processing and other services, we maintain and manage large bank and investment accounts containing client funds, which we hold as agent, as well as operational funds.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our revenues include investment earnings related to client fund cash balances.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our choices in selecting investments, or market conditions that affect the rate of return on or the availability of investments, could have an adverse effect on the level of such revenues.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The amounts held in our operational and client deposit accounts could exceed the limits of government insurance programs of organizations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation, exposing us to the risk of loss.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Any such loss would have an adverse impact on our business and our financial condition.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our revenues could decrease if client contracts are terminated or fail to renew or if clients renegotiate contracts or utilize our services at lower than anticipated levels.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We derive most of our revenue by selling products and services under long-term contracts, many of which contain terms and conditions based on anticipated levels of utilization of our services.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We cannot unilaterally extend the terms of our client contracts when they expire.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Contracts can terminate during the term of agreement for various reasons, including through termination for convenience clauses in some contracts that enable clients to cancel by written notice.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our revenues could decrease as a result of terminations or non-renewals of client contracts; extensions of client contracts under, or contract re-negotiations resulting in, less favorable terms; or utilization of services at less than anticipated levels.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Our businesses expose us to risks of claims and losses that could be significant and damage our reputation and business prospects.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Our proprietary applications and related consulting and other services include the processing or clearing of financial and healthcare transactions for our clients and their customers and the design of benefit plans and compliance programs.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S6	The dollar amount of transactions processed or cleared is vastly higher than the revenues we derive from providing these services.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S7	In the event we make transaction processing or operational errors, or mismanage any process, we could be exposed to claims for any resulting processing delays, disclosure of protected information, miscalculations, mishandling of pass-through disbursements or other processes, and failure to follow a client's instructions or meet specifications.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Additionally, we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from a failure of third parties (including regulatory authorities) to recognize the limitations of our role as our clients' agent or consultant, and we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from fraud committed by third parties.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S9	We may be exposed to the risk of counterparty breaches or failure to perform.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S10	We may be subject to claims, including class actions, for reimbursements, losses or damages arising from any transaction processing or operational error, or from process mismanagement.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P18_S11	Because of the sensitive nature of the financial and healthcare transactions we process, our liability and any alleged damages may significantly exceed the fees we receive for performing the service at issue.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Litigation could include class action claims based, among other theories, upon various regulatory requirements and consumer protection and privacy laws that class action plaintiffs may attempt to use to assert private rights of action.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any of these claims and related settlements or judgments could affect our operating results, damage our reputation, decrease demand for our services, or cause us to make costly operating changes.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We are substantially dependent on our intellectual property rights, and a claim for infringement or a requirement to indemnify a client for infringement could adversely affect us.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We have made substantial investments in software and other intellectual property on which our business is highly dependent.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We rely on patent, trade secret and copyright laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and security measures to protect our proprietary technology.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We cannot guarantee these measures will be effective.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Our products and services rely on technology developed by others, including open source software, and we have no control over possible infringement of someone else's intellectual property rights by the provider of this technology.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P19_S7	The owner of the rights could seek damages from us rather than or in addition to the persons who provide the technology to us.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P19_S8	We could be subject at any time to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to evaluate and defend.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P19_S9	Our clients may also face infringement claims, allege that such claims relate to our products and services, and seek indemnification from us.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P19_S10	Any loss of our intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights of others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Failure to protect our confidential information and that of our clients, their customers, and our employees could hurt our business.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We electronically maintain sensitive intellectual property, proprietary information and personally identifiable information, including financial and personal health information, of our clients, their customers and our employees.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In certain circumstances, vendors have access to such information in order to assist us with responsibilities such as, producing benefit plan identification cards, maintaining software we license on our own behalf or resell to others, or helping clients comply with anti-money laundering regulations.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	A breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We maintain systems and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to electronic information and cybersecurity attacks, and we generally impose security requirements on our vendors, but we cannot guarantee these systems, procedures or requirements will always protect us.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Rapid advances in technology may prevent us from anticipating all potential security threats or promptly identifying all security breaches, and the limits and costs of technology, skills and manpower could prevent us from adequately addressing these threats.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We do not control certain businesses in which we have significant ownership.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We invest in joint ventures and other unconsolidated affiliates as part of our business strategy, and part of our net income is derived from our pro rata share of the earnings of those businesses.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Despite owning significant equity interests in those companies and having directors on their boards, we do not control their operations, strategies or financial decisions.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The other owners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the businesses we co-own.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Our pro rata share of any losses due to unfavorable performance of those companies could negatively impact our financial results.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Some of our joint venture investments are subject to buy-sell agreements, which may, among other things, restrict us from selling our interests even if we were to determine it is prudent to do so.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	We own interests in unconsolidated entities including Boston Financial Data Services, International Financial Data Services Limited Partnership, International Financial Data Services Limited, and various real estate joint ventures.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Our interests in such unconsolidated entities are subject to buy/sell arrangements, which may restrict our ability to sell our interests even if we were to determine it is prudent to do so.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S8	These arrangements may also allow us to purchase the other owners' interests to prevent someone else from acquiring them and we cannot control the timing of occasions to do so.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S9	The businesses or other owners may encourage us to increase our investment in or make contributions to the businesses at an inopportune time.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S10	We hold equity investments in companies that operate in various industries, and the value of those investments could decrease.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S11	We hold significant investments in available-for-sale equity securities of other companies or other financial interests that are subject to fluctuations in market prices.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S12	A significant decline in the value of our equity investments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S13	We may not always be able to sell those investments at higher prices than we paid for them or than the value of the consideration used to acquire them.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S14	We hold significant investments in illiquid private equity funds.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S15	We are a limited partner in various private equity funds and have future capital commitments related to certain private equity fund investments.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S16	Generally, private equity fund securities are non-transferable or are subject to long holding periods, and withdrawals from the private equity firm partnerships are typically not permitted.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S17	Even when transfer restrictions do not apply, there is generally no public market for the securities.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P22_S18	Therefore, we may not be able to sell the securities at a time when we desire to do so.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Various plans, agreements, laws and organizational documents may have anti-takeover effects.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, certain plans and agreements, and applicable laws could make it more difficult for a party to make a tender offer for our shares or complete a takeover, which is not approved by our Board of Directors.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	legal restrictions on business combinations with certain stockholders Because of contractual commitments, a change in control could affect our operating results and weaken our management retention and incentive tools.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	A change in control of the Company would trigger various rights and obligations in service agreements with our customers and in agreements governing our joint ventures.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	A change in control could also allow some clients to terminate their agreements with us or to obtain rights to use our processing software.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are parties to joint venture agreements that allow other co-owners to buy our equity interests if we undergo a change in control.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Under certain executive equity-based and other incentive compensation awards, benefit programs and employment agreements with our management, a change in control by itself, or an individual's termination of employment without cause or resignation for good reason (each as defined in applicable agreements) after a change in control could accelerate funding, payment or vesting of equity grants, as applicable, under such agreements and programs.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	This accelerated funding, vesting or payment may decrease an employee's incentive to continue employment with us.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Certain executive officers have agreements with us that require us to continue to employ them for three years after a change in control or to pay certain amounts if we terminate their employment without cause or they resign for good reason following a change in control.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P25_S4	The executives might not be incented to achieve desired results for the new owners of our business, and the cost of keeping the executives on the payroll might deter potential new owners from acquiring us or hinder new owners from hiring replacement management.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Certain changes in ownership of the Company could potentially affect the continuation of investment advisory and distribution services provided by ALPS subsidiaries, which could potentially limit the Company's share repurchases and negatively impact the Company's financial results.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, ALPS Holdings, Inc., has subsidiaries that serve as investment advisors or distributors for certain registered investment companies ( Funds ).
714603_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If more than 25% of the Company's outstanding voting securities were to become held by a single owner, a change of control of the ALPS subsidiaries constituting an assignment of their investment advisory contracts and distribution contracts could be deemed to have occurred.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Any deemed assignment would automatically terminate the ALPS subsidiaries' investment advisory and distribution contracts with the Funds, and the Funds would be required to seek shareowner approval of new investment advisory contracts in order to continue an advisory relationship with the ALPS subsidiaries.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	There can be no assurance that any Fund with a distribution contract would retain the ALPS subsidiary as its distributor or that any Fund with an investment advisory contract would obtain the required shareowner vote to retain, or that it would retain, the ALPS subsidiary as its investment advisor.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The potential impact of a deemed assignment may limit the Company's ability to repurchase its shares.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P26_S5	The loss by ALPS subsidiaries of investment advisory and/or distribution contracts could negatively impact the operating results of the Company.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Our equity incentive and stockholders' rights plans could have a dilutive effect on our common stock.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Our directors, officers and certain managers have received restricted stock units and options to purchase our common stock as part of their compensation.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P26_S8	These equity grants could have a dilutive effect on our common stock.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P26_S9	The rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock (as determined pursuant to the rights plan) without the approval of our Board of Directors.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P26_S10	A triggering of the rights plan could in some circumstances be dilutive in value to common stockholders who do not exercise their rights.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future .
714603_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Future cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Payment of dividends is subject to applicable laws and to restrictions in applicable debt agreements.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	If we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited and our financial condition adversely affected.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our business strategy anticipates that we will supplement internal growth by pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We may be unable to identify suitable businesses to acquire.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	We compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other complementary businesses.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P29_S4	If we cannot complete acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Information we obtain about an acquisition target may be limited and there can be no assurance that an acquisition will perform as expected or positively impact our financial performance.
714603_14_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Potential acquisitions involve risk, including the risk we would be unable to effectively integrate the acquired technologies, operations and personnel into our business, and the risk that management's attention and our capital would be diverted from other areas of our business.

714603_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Processing and Customer Communications volumes for mutual fund customers are usually highest during the quarter ended March 31 due primarily to processing year-end transactions and printing and mailing of year-end statements and tax forms during January.
714603_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	The Company has historically added operating equipment in the last half of the year in preparation for processing year-end transactions, which has the effect of increasing costs for the second half of the year.
714603_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Revenues and operating results from individual license sales depend heavily on the timing and size of the contract.
714603_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standard update, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.

714603_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	This standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
714603_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard but does not expect it to materially impact the consolidated financial statements.
714603_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	On January 1, 2013, DST adopted new authoritative accounting guidance that modifies the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
714603_14_ITEM7_P18_S5	The standard requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in the consolidated statement of income if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety to net income.
714603_14_ITEM7_P18_S6	For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference to other required disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts.
714603_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.
714603_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for enhanced disclosures provided as a result of the new standard.
714603_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
714603_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
714603_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
714603_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
714603_14_ITEM7_P20_S4	The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; software capitalization and amortization; depreciation of fixed assets; valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill; accounting for investments; and accounting for income taxes.
714603_14_ITEM7_P20_S5	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
714603_14_ITEM7_P20_S6	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
714603_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned.
714603_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The majority of the Company's revenues are computer processing and services revenues and are recognized upon completion of the services provided.
714603_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all customer obligations have been met.
714603_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	The Company generally does not have customer obligations that extend beyond one year.
714603_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Revenue from equipment sales is recognized as equipment is shipped.
714603_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Revenue from operating leases is recognized monthly as the rent accrues.
714603_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Billing for services in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.
714603_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	Allowances for billing adjustments and doubtful account expense are estimated as revenues are recognized and are recorded as reductions in revenues, and the annual amounts are immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
714603_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	The Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.
714603_14_ITEM7_P22_S5	If there is a customer acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until the Company has evidence of customer acceptance.
714603_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control of the Company.
714603_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	consideration should be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
714603_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence ( TPE ) such as how competitors have priced similar items.
714603_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	If such evidence is unavailable, the Company uses its best estimate of the selling price ( BESP ), which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.
714603_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	It is not common for the Company to use TPE and BESP as VSOE can be established for the majority of DST's client arrangements.
714603_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	Deferral of software license revenue results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	The Company recognizes revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectability has been reasonably assured.
714603_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	The Company derives over 90% of its revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts.
714603_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	The majority of the amount is billed on a monthly basis generally with thirty-day collection terms.
714603_14_ITEM7_P25_S5	Revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon performance of the services.
714603_14_ITEM7_P25_S6	In the event a portion of the Company's revenues are due 12 months or more from the invoice date, the Company accounts for the revenue as not being fixed or determinable.
714603_14_ITEM7_P25_S7	In these cases, the revenue is recognized as it becomes due.
714603_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Company's standard business practice is to bill monthly for development, consulting and training services on a time and materials basis.
714603_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	In some cases the Company bills a fixed fee for development and consulting services.
714603_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	For fixed fee arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue on a proportionate performance basis.
714603_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	The Company derives less than 10% of its revenues from licensing products.
714603_14_ITEM7_P26_S4	The Company licenses its asset management products, AWD products, healthcare administration processing software solutions and customer billing software solution products.
714603_14_ITEM7_P26_S5	Perpetual software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_14_ITEM7_P26_S6	Deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Term software license revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement.
714603_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	While license fee revenues are not a significant percentage of DST's total operations, they can significantly impact earnings in the period in which they are recognized.
714603_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Revenues from individual license sales depend heavily on the timing, size and nature of the contract.
714603_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary ALPS, may enter into arrangements with broker/dealers or other third parties to sell or market closed-end fund shares.
714603_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	Depending on the arrangement, ALPS may earn distribution fees for marketing and selling the underlying fund shares.
714603_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	Conversely, ALPS may incur distribution expenses, including structuring fees, finders' fees and referral fees paid to unaffiliated broker/dealers or introducing parties for marketing and selling underlying fund shares of a closed-end fund sponsored by ALPS.
714603_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	While distribution revenues and expenses are not significant percentages of DST's operating revenues or costs and expenses, they can significantly impact operations and earnings in the period in which they are recognized.
714603_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Company has entered into various agreements with related parties, principally unconsolidated affiliates, to utilize the Company's data processing facilities and computer software systems.
714603_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company believes that the terms of its contracts with related parties are fair to the Company and are no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties.
714603_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Company assesses collection based on a variety of factors, including past collection history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer.
714603_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Company generally does not request collateral from its customers.
714603_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	If it is determined that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.
714603_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	Allowances for billing adjustments are determined as revenues are recognized and are recorded as reductions in revenues.
714603_14_ITEM7_P31_S4	Doubtful account expense for the Company is immaterial.
714603_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Software capitalization and amortization The Company makes substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of its processing and services as well as its sale of licensed products.
714603_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to five years.
714603_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company also develops a large portion of its software internally.
714603_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Company capitalizes software development costs for computer software developed or obtained for internal use after the design has been approved and management is committed to funding the project.
714603_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	For computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed to third parties, the Company capitalizes research and development costs after technological feasibility has been established and management is committed to funding the project.
714603_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis, based on an estimated economic life, which is dependent on the nature of the project.
714603_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	The Company has assigned lives of three to five years for capitalized software development.
714603_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Significant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects.
714603_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	Management specifically analyzes software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts, milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects.
714603_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	Significant changes in any of these items may result in discontinuing capitalization of development costs, as well as immediately expensing previously capitalized costs.
714603_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company reviews, on a quarterly basis, its capitalized software for possible impairment.
714603_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Depreciation of fixed assets The Company's approach on personal property, specifically data processing, printing and inserting equipment, is to own the property as opposed to leasing it where practicable.
714603_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	The Company believes this approach provides it better flexibility for disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life.
714603_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Company depreciates data processing equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives: (1) non-mainframe equipment three years; (2) mainframe central processing unit four years; and (3) mainframe direct access storage devices and tape devices five years.
714603_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Company depreciates furniture and fixtures over estimated useful lives, principally three to five years, using accelerated depreciation methods.
714603_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	The Company depreciates large printing and inserting equipment used by the Customer Communications Segment over a five to seven year life using accelerated depreciation methods.
714603_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	The Company depreciates leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements.
714603_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Management judgment is required in assigning economic lives to fixed assets.
714603_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Management specifically analyzes fixed asset additions, remaining net book values and gain/loss upon disposition of fixed assets to determine the appropriateness of assigned economic lives.
714603_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	Significant changes in any of these items may result in changes in the economic life assigned and the resulting depreciation expense.
714603_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill The Company and its unconsolidated affiliates do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives.
714603_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and assesses identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
714603_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Factors that are considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of the Company's use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and significant negative industry or economic trends.
714603_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	When it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, the Company assesses actual impairment based on gross cash flows.
714603_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The Company's assessment of goodwill for impairment includes comparing the fair value to the net book value of our reporting units.
714603_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	The Company estimates fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches.
714603_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is necessary.
714603_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company performs a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
714603_14_ITEM7_P41_S5	To measure the amount of any impairment loss, the Company determines the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the affected reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination.
714603_14_ITEM7_P41_S6	Specifically, the Company allocates the fair value of the affected reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill.
714603_14_ITEM7_P41_S7	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.
714603_14_ITEM7_P41_S8	The Company's 2013 annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units substantially exceeds its carrying value.
714603_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Accounting for investments The Company has three significant types of investments: 1) investments in available-for-sale securities, the largest of which is its investment in State Street common stock; 2) investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which is comprised principally of BFDS, IFDS U.K., IFDS L.P. and certain real estate joint ventures; and 3) investments in private equity funds and other investments accounted for under the cost method.
714603_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	The Company accounts for investments in entities in which it owns less than 20% and does not have significant influence, in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, which requires the Company to designate its investments as trading or available-for-sale.
714603_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity.
714603_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company records an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary.
714603_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment's current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on the Company's financial position.
714603_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	The equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have at least a 20% voting interest and significant influence but do not control, and for all investments in partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where the Company is a limited partner) which the Company has at least 5% ownership and does not control.
714603_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	The Company classifies these investments as unconsolidated affiliates.
714603_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	Under the equity method, the Company recognizes income or losses from its pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates' net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of the Company's investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_14_ITEM7_P44_S4	The cost method of accounting is used for these investments when the Company has a de-minimus ownership percentage and no ability to exercise significant influence.
714603_14_ITEM7_P44_S5	The Company's cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.
714603_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Accounting for income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance.
714603_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns.
714603_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).
714603_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
714603_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact the consolidated financial statements.
714603_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
714603_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be required.
714603_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	If the Company ultimately determines that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, then it reverses the liability and recognizes a tax benefit during the period in which it determines that the liability is no longer necessary.
714603_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	The Company also recognizes tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that its positions will be sustained if challenged by the taxing authorities.
714603_14_ITEM7_P46_S4	To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which liabilities have been established, or is required to pay amounts in excess of its liabilities, the Company's effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected.
714603_14_ITEM7_P46_S5	An unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and may result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_14_ITEM7_P46_S6	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in its effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Company reports interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes.
714603_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's operating results (millions, except per share amounts):
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Consolidated revenues Consolidated total revenues (including out-of-pocket ( OOP ) reimbursements) increased $82.0 million or 3.2% during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to December 31, 2012 and increased $187.9 million or 7.9% during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to December 31, 2011 .
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	Consolidated operating revenues increased $68.2 million or 3.6% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and increased $148.4 million or 8.5% in 2012 as compared to 2011 .
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	The Company experienced operating revenue growth from all three of its operating Segments in both 2013 and 2012.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	Financial Services Segment operating revenues increase d during 2013 , as compared to 2012, primarily attributable to increased operating revenues from ALPS, DST Brokerage Solutions, DST Bluedoor, and DST Retirement Solutions, for which the latter included a $6.0 million client termination payment received in first quarter 2013.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	These revenue increases were partially offset by lower operating revenues for mutual fund shareowner processing resulting from lower registered accounts serviced and lower software license revenue in the Financial Services Segment.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S5	Healthcare Services Segment operating revenue increased 10.9% during 2013 from higher pharmacy claims paid as well as growth from existing and new clients on the DST Health Solutions' processing platform.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S6	Customer Communications operating revenue increased during 2013 primarily from new client volumes in North America.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S7	The operating revenue growth in 2012 as compared to 2011 was partially driven by higher Financial Services Segment operating revenues during 2012 , from the inclusion of a full year of ALPS operations (acquired on October 31, 2011) in 2012 versus two months in 2011 , partially offset by lower operating revenues for mutual fund shareowner processing resulting from lower registered accounts serviced.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S8	The increase in Healthcare Services Segment operating revenues in 2012 was primarily the result of higher pharmacy claims paid.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S9	The increase in Customer Communications Segment operating revenue in 2012 was the result of a full year of operations from the 2011 acquisitions of Lateral in the U.K. (acquired on August 2, 2011) and Newkirk (acquired on May 2, 2011) in North America, as well as new client volumes in North America, offset by decreased demand and lower revenues per package in the U.K. Consolidated OOP reimbursements increased $13.8 million or 2.0% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and increased $39.5 million or 6.1% in 2012 as compared to 2011 .
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S10	The net increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2013 is attributable to higher volumes from new clients in our Customer Communications Segment, partially offset by a decrease in the Financial Services Segment attributable to lower registered accounts serviced.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S11	The net increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2012 was attributable to higher volumes from new clients and a full year of volumes from Lateral and Newkirk in the Customer Communications Segment and an increase in the Financial Services Segment from the inclusion of a full year of ALPS operations.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S12	Income from operations Consolidated income from operations increased $155.9 million or 99.1% to $313.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012 and decreased $102.8 million or 39.5% to $157.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011 .
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S13	The increase in 2013 is primarily attributable to the 2012 goodwill impairment in the Customer Communications - U.K. reporting unit and other charges described below that did not recur in 2013 as well as the $6.0 million 2013 contract termination payment received.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S14	Absent these 2012 and 2013 non-recurring items, consolidated income from operations increased $40.0 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to increased operating revenues coupled with cost containment activities.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S15	The decrease in consolidated income from operations in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily the result of the following items that occurred during 2012: non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $60.8 million, $11.0 million of leased facility abandonment costs, net losses of $7.1 million on real estate assets, $11.0 million of costs associated with a charitable donation of appreciated marketable securities, increased employee termination costs of $10.9 million and $9.1 million of costs associated with the discontinuation of the insurance processing solution for the insurance market.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S16	Additionally, $7.3 million of restructuring costs were incurred in 2011 to amend a sales / marketing agreement from an acquired business, which did not recur in 2012.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S17	Interest expense Interest expense was $34.5 million , $43.5 million and $46.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S18	Interest expense decreased 20.7% during 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily from lower weighted average debt balances outstanding, as well as lower weighted average interest rates.
714603_14_ITEM7_P49_S19	Interest expense decreased during 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily from lower weighted average debt balances outstanding.
714603_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Other income, net The components of other income, net are as follows (in millions):

714603_14_ITEM7_P54_S4	DST's equity in earnings of BFDS decreased $2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012 .
714603_14_ITEM7_P54_S5	The decrease is primarily from lower revenues associated with reduced levels of accounts serviced and lower interest income, partially offset by the recognition of a deferred gain from the 2013 sale of an investment in Cofunds, Ltd. of $1.1 million .
714603_14_ITEM7_P54_S6	DST's equity in earnings of BFDS increased $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011 .

714603_14_ITEM7_P54_S9	The remaining decline is primarily due to continued costs associated with the establishment of new service offerings, which include the development and build-out of a wealth management platform for the U.K. marketplace utilizing DST's Bluedoor technology, partially offset by higher revenues from increased accounts serviced.
714603_14_ITEM7_P54_S10	DST's equity in earnings of IFDS increased $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 , as compared to 2011 , primarily from IFDS Canada's gain on the sale of its interest in a Canadian real estate partnership and revenue from new clients, partially offset by costs for new product development initiatives and client conversion activities.
714603_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	IFDS has had two significant client developments within their U.K. operations.
714603_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	During late 2013, IFDS U.K. signed a new client, which provides wealth management solutions for financial advisers, to a long-term contract.

714603_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Company's income tax rate for 2013 was favorably impacted by the completion of the IRS examination of previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 and research and experimentation credits for the periods 2006 through 2009.
714603_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	As a result, the Company recognized income tax benefits of $16.1 million in 2013.
714603_14_ITEM7_P56_S3	The income tax benefit for the research and experimentation credits relates to the resolved claim years and certain post-audit periods that are still subject to examination.

714603_14_ITEM7_P56_S5	The 2013 effective tax rate also includes a tax expense of $7.5 million relating to an increase in the overall incremental U.S. tax expected to be imposed upon the repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings previously considered permanently reinvested.

714603_14_ITEM7_P56_S9	The tax rates in each of the three years ended December 31, 2013 were affected by tax benefits relating to certain international operations and recognition of state tax benefits associated with income apportionment rules.
714603_14_ITEM7_P56_S10	Excluding the effect of discrete period items, the Company expects its tax rate to be approximately 37% in 2014 .
714603_14_ITEM7_P56_S11	The 2014 tax rate can be affected as a result of variances among the estimates and amounts of 2014 sources of taxable income (e.g., domestic consolidated, joint venture and/or international), the realization of tax credits (e.g., historic rehabilitation, research and experimentation and state incentive), adjustments which may arise from the resolution of tax matters under review and the Company's assessment of its liability for uncertain tax positions.
714603_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	On September 12, 2013, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service released final regulations that provide guidance on the deductibility of amounts paid to acquire, produce, or improve tangible property and recovery of basis upon disposition.

714603_14_ITEM7_P64_S5	The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily attributable to increased operating revenues at ALPS, DST Brokerage Solutions, DST Retirement Solutions, and DST Bluedoor, partially offset by lower operating revenues from DST's U.S. registered shareowner account processing and lower software license revenues.
714603_14_ITEM7_P64_S6	Operating revenues also decreased from changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other foreign currencies.
714603_14_ITEM7_P64_S7	The increased revenue at ALPS was due to organic growth at existing clients, favorable market conditions and revenues from new clients during 2013.
714603_14_ITEM7_P64_S8	Approximately three-fourths of ALPS revenues are calculated based upon a percentage of the assets within the funds that it services and are therefore subject to fluctuation based on the amount of assets managed or distributed.
714603_14_ITEM7_P64_S9	DST Brokerage Solutions had increased revenues from conversions of new clients and organic growth from existing clients while DST Bluedoor's increased revenues were primarily from higher software license sales and professional services revenue associated with the expansion into the U.K. market.
714603_14_ITEM7_P64_S10	DST Retirement Solutions operating revenues during 2013 increased as compared to 2012 primarily from higher defined contribution participants processed as new clients were converted, partially offset by reductions in participants serviced due to the annual removal of prior year terminated participants.
714603_14_ITEM7_P64_S11	Operating revenues were also favorably impacted by a $6.0 million contract termination payment received from partial termination of a DST Retirement client during 2013.
714603_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Operating revenues from DST Global Solutions and DST's business process and document management businesses, including AWD, decreased during 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily from lower software license revenues and professional services.
714603_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	DST Global Solutions had a perpetual software license sale and associated professional service revenue in 2012 that did not recur in 2013.
714603_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	Financial Services operating revenues include approximately $38.1 million of software license fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 , a decrease of $5.0 million as compared to 2012 .
714603_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	DST also experienced decreased revenue from DST's U.S. registered shareowner account processing due to lower registered accounts primarily as a result of subaccounting conversions.
714603_14_ITEM7_P65_S4	Registered accounts serviced at December 31, 2013 decreased 4.5 million or 5.9% from December 31, 2012 .
714603_14_ITEM7_P65_S5	During 2013, approximately 5.1 million registered accounts converted to subaccounting platforms of which 1.6 million converted to DST's platform.
714603_14_ITEM7_P65_S6	For 2014, DST currently projects total conversions of registered accounts to subaccounts will approximate 4-5 million.
714603_14_ITEM7_P65_S7	The 2014 estimated conversions to subaccounting include conversions of tax-advantaged registered accounts.
714603_14_ITEM7_P65_S8	DST has been informed that certain broker/dealers may convert certain tax-advantaged accounts to a subaccounting platform, however, the timing and number of accounts is not currently known.
714603_14_ITEM7_P65_S9	The number of accounts estimated to convert from various DST platforms is based upon information obtained from clients.
714603_14_ITEM7_P65_S10	There are a number of factors that will affect the actual amount of conversions and the timing of those conversions.
714603_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	In 2012 , Financial Services Segment total revenues of $1,028.3 million increased $92.3 million or 9.9% as compared to 2011 .

714603_14_ITEM7_P66_S4	The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily attributable to $81.8 million of incremental revenue from a full year of ALPS in 2012 as compared to two months in 2011 .
714603_14_ITEM7_P66_S5	DST Global Solutions revenues also increased during 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily attributable to increased software licenses sales and support.
714603_14_ITEM7_P66_S6	Increases in operating revenues from DST Brokerage during 2012 were offset by lower operating revenues for mutual fund registered shareowner account servicing.
714603_14_ITEM7_P66_S7	Registered accounts serviced at December 31, 2012 decreased 9.4 million accounts or 11.0% from December 31, 2011 .

714603_14_ITEM7_P66_S12	On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2013 is primarily from higher costs to support the increased revenues, increased deferred compensation plan costs of $5.8 million (the effect of which is offset as unrealized gains on trading securities in other income) and $2.8 million incurred for the launch of a new closed-end fund at ALPS, offset by lower employee termination expenses and lower costs as a result of exiting the insurance processing solutions business in 2012.
714603_14_ITEM7_P66_S13	Costs and expenses also decreased from changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other foreign currencies.

714603_14_ITEM7_P66_S17	On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2012 is primarily from the inclusion of a full year of ALPS and other 2011 business acquisitions, increased employee compensation and benefit costs, incremental new product development costs at DST Brokerage and DST Retirement, increased employee termination expenses and higher deferred compensation plan costs (which is offset in other income), partially offset by the 2011 restructuring costs to amend a sales / marketing agreement of an acquired business which did not recur in 2012 .

714603_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The decrease in 2013 is primarily the result of a $5.8 million asset impairment charge incurred in 2012 which did not recur in 2013 and lower capitalized software costs.
714603_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Financial Services Segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $74.3 million , an increase of $17.4 million or 30.6% as compared to 2011 .

714603_14_ITEM7_P68_S4	The increase is also the result of employee termination costs and other costs in 2012 that did not recur in 2013.

714603_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	In addition to reporting operating income, pretax income, net income, net income attributable to DST Systems, Inc. ( DST Earnings ) and earnings per share on a GAAP basis, DST has also made certain non-GAAP adjustments which are described below in the section titled Description of Non-GAAP Adjustments and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the attached financial schedules titled Reconciliation of Reported Results to Income Adjusted for Certain Non-GAAP Items below.
714603_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	In making these non-GAAP adjustments, the Company takes into account the impact of items that are not necessarily ongoing in nature, that do not have a high level of predictability associated with them or that are non-operational in nature.
714603_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	Generally, these items include net gains on dispositions of business units, net gains (losses) associated with securities and other investments, restructuring and impairment costs and other similar items.
714603_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a useful basis for evaluating underlying business unit performance, but should not be considered in isolation and is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, evaluating business unit performance utilizing GAAP financial information.
714603_14_ITEM7_P86_S3	Management uses non-GAAP measures in its budgeting and forecasting processes and to further analyze its financial trends and operational run-rate, as well as making financial comparisons to prior periods presented on a similar basis.
714603_14_ITEM7_P86_S4	The Company believes that providing such adjusted results allows investors and other users of DST's financial statements to better understand DST's comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
714603_14_ITEM7_P86_S5	DST's management uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures in its own evaluation of the Company's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods.
714603_14_ITEM7_P86_S6	DST's non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.
714603_14_ITEM7_P86_S7	Although DST's management believes non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, DST acknowledges that items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on the Company's income from operations, pretax income, net income, net income attributable to DST Systems, Inc. and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.
714603_14_ITEM7_P86_S8	Therefore, management typically uses Non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP results.
714603_14_ITEM7_P86_S9	These factors should be considered when evaluating DST's results.

714603_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The impact of a 10% change in fair value of these investments would be approximately $40.5 million to comprehensive income.
714603_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As discussed under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Comprehensive Income above, net unrealized gains and losses on the Company's investments in available-for-sale securities have had a material effect on the Company's comprehensive income (loss) and financial position.

714603_14_ITEM7A_P2_S6	The Company estimates that a 10% increase in interest rates would not be material to the Company's consolidated pretax earnings or to the fair value of its debt.
714603_14_ITEM7A_P2_S7	The effect of changes in interest rates on the Company s variable rate debt is somewhat neutralized by changes in interest rates attributable to balance earnings.
714603_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate risk The operation of the Company's subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
714603_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The principal currencies involved are the British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Thai baht and Indian rupee.

714603_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Furthermore, a 10% change in exchange rates based upon historical earnings in international operations could change consolidated reported net income for 2013 by approximately $1.8 million .
714603_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	During 2013, the Company entered into foreign currency cash flow and economic hedging programs to mitigate the impact of movements in foreign currency (principally British pound, Canadian dollar and Thai baht) on the Company's operations.

714603_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The fair value of of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $0.4 million at December 31, 2013.
714603_14_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The Company estimates that a 10% change in exchange rates would result in a $0.4 million change in other comprehensive income.
714603_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $0.3 million at December 31, 2013.
714603_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The company estimates a 10% change in exchange rates on these contracts would result in a $5.1 million change to consolidated net income.
714603_14_ITEM7A_P7_S2	All gains and losses on the derivative instruments are offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no net material impact on earnings.
714603_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Excluding the intercompany loans that have been hedged, the Company has approximately $9.9 million of unhedged intercompany loans as of December 31, 2013 with certain of its international subsidiaries that are expected to be repaid.
714603_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The Company estimates that a 10% change in exchange rates on these unhedged intercompany loans would not have a significant impact on net income.

714603_14_ITEM8_P1_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
714603_14_ITEM8_P1_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

714603_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

714603_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
714603_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

714603_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company consolidates any entity in which it has a controlling financial interest.
714603_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Under the voting interest model, generally the investor that has voting control (usually more than 50% of an entity's voting interests) consolidates the entity.
714603_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	Under the variable interest entity ( VIE ) model, the party that has the power to direct the entity's most significant economic activities and the ability to participate in the entity's economics consolidates the entity.
714603_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	An entity is considered a VIE if it possesses one of the following characteristics: 1) the entity is thinly capitalized; 2) residual equity holders do not control the entity; 3) equity holders are shielded from economic losses; 4) equity holders do not participate fully in an entity's residual economics; and 5) the entity was established with non-substantive voting interests.

714603_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	The lessors are generally joint ventures (in which the Company has a 50% ownership) that have been established specifically to purchase, finance and engage in leasing activities with the joint venture partners and unrelated third parties.
714603_14_ITEM8_P21_S2	Leases may not be variable interests if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, renewal options at terms other than fair value, fixed price purchase options or similar features that disproportionately obligate a company to absorb decreases in value or entitle it to participate in increases in the value of the real estate.
714603_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company's analysis of its real estate joint ventures at December 31, 2013 indicate that none qualified as a VIE and, accordingly, they have not been consolidated.
714603_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
714603_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
714603_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned.
714603_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	The majority of the Company's revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided.
714603_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all customer obligations have been met.
714603_14_ITEM8_P24_S3	The Company generally does not have customer obligations that extend beyond one year.
714603_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	Revenue from equipment sales is recognized as equipment is shipped.
714603_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	Revenue from operating leases is recognized monthly as the rent accrues.
714603_14_ITEM8_P25_S2	Billing for services in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.
714603_14_ITEM8_P25_S3	Allowances for billing adjustments and doubtful account expense are estimated as revenues are recognized and are recorded as reductions in revenues, and the annual amounts are immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
714603_14_ITEM8_P25_S4	The Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.
714603_14_ITEM8_P25_S5	If there is a customer acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until the Company has evidence of customer acceptance.
714603_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control of the Company.
714603_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration should be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
714603_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence ( TPE ) such as how competitors have priced similar items.
714603_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	If such evidence is unavailable, the Company uses its best estimate of the selling price ( BESP ), which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.
714603_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	It is not common for the Company to use TPE and BESP as VSOE can be established for the majority of DST's client arrangements.
714603_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	Deferral of software license revenue results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_14_ITEM8_P28_S2	The Company recognizes revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectability has been reasonably assured.
714603_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Authoritative accounting guidance related to the income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out-of-pocket ( OOP ) expenses incurred requires the Company to record reimbursements received for OOP expenses as revenue on an accrual basis.
714603_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	Because these additional revenues are offset by the reimbursable expenses incurred, it does not impact income from operations or net income.
714603_14_ITEM8_P29_S2	The Company's significant OOP expenses at the consolidated level include postage and telecommunication expenditures and at the segment level include print mail services between the Financial Services Segment and the Customer Communications Segment.
714603_14_ITEM8_P29_S3	For each segment, total revenues are reported in two categories, operating revenues and OOP reimbursements.
714603_14_ITEM8_P29_S4	OOP expenses are included in costs and expenses.
714603_14_ITEM8_P29_S5	Costs and expenses Costs and expenses include all costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, incurred by the Company to produce revenues.
714603_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company believes that the nature of its business as well as its organizational structure, in which virtually all officers and associates have operational responsibilities, does not allow for a meaningful segregation of selling, general and administrative costs.
714603_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	These costs, which the Company believes to be immaterial, are also included in costs and expenses.
714603_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Substantially all depreciation and amortization is directly associated with the production of revenues.
714603_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Cash equivalents Short-term liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents.
714603_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	Due to the short-term nature of these investments, carrying value approximates market value.
714603_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Client funds/obligations Funds held on behalf of clients In connection with providing data processing services for its clients, the Company may hold client funds, comprised of funds held on behalf of transfer agency clients and funds held on behalf of pharmacy processing clients.

714603_14_ITEM8_P33_S5	Client funding receivable Client funding receivables represent amounts due to the Company for pharmacy claims paid in advance of receiving client funding and for pharmacy claims processed for which client funding requests have not been made.
714603_14_ITEM8_P33_S6	Client funds obligations Client funds obligations represent the Company's contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by the Company.
714603_14_ITEM8_P33_S7	In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency client balances invested overnight.
714603_14_ITEM8_P33_S8	Client funds obligations represent liabilities that will be repaid within one year of the balance sheet date.

714603_14_ITEM8_P36_S2	Cost for substantially all of the Company's inventories is determined on a specific identification or first-in, first-out basis.
714603_14_ITEM8_P36_S3	Investments The equity method of accounting is used for companies in which the Company or its subsidiaries have at least a 20% voting interest and significant influence but do not control; the cost method of accounting is used for investments of less than 20% voting interest.
714603_14_ITEM8_P36_S4	Partnership and similar investment interests (including investments in private equity funds where the Company is a limited partner) in which the Company has at least 5% ownership are accounted for on an equity method basis based on the Company's pro-rata ownership; the cost method of accounting is used for these investments when the Company has a de-minimus ownership percentage and does not have significant influence.
714603_14_ITEM8_P36_S5	Under the equity method, the Company recognizes income or losses from its pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates' net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_14_ITEM8_P36_S6	In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of the Company's investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Investments classified as available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income.

714603_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company evaluates the net realizable value of capitalized software development costs on a product-by-product basis.
714603_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets The authoritative accounting guidance for goodwill and intangible assets addresses, among other things, how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements.
714603_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Intangible assets at December 31, 2013 and 2012 primarily represent customer relationship and other definite lived intangible assets (trade names, non-compete agreements, etc.) acquired through a business combination or third party purchase.
714603_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	The estimated useful life on these intangible assets ranges from 3 to 17 years.
714603_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	The weighted average amortization period at December 31, 2013 for customer relationships and other intangible assets is 13.9 and 9.1 years, respectively.
714603_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and assesses identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
714603_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	Intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.
714603_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company's assessment of goodwill for impairment includes comparing the fair value to the net book value of our reporting units.
714603_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	The Company's 2013 annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units substantially exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units.
714603_14_ITEM8_P48_S2	During 2012, the goodwill held at the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit was impaired as further described in Note 9 of these financial statements.
714603_14_ITEM8_P48_S3	The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows.
714603_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	Income taxes The Company recognizes the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.
714603_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	Deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the liability method.
714603_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and differences between the income tax and financial accounting statement bases of assets and liabilities and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment.
714603_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	The income statement effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes on the balance sheet.
714603_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	From time to time, the Company enters into transactions for which the tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code or applicable state tax laws is uncertain.
714603_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	The Company provides federal and/or state income taxes on such transactions, together with related interest, net of income tax benefit, and any applicable penalties in accordance with accounting guidance for income tax uncertainties.
714603_14_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Company records income tax uncertainties that are estimated to take more than 12 months to resolve as non-current.
714603_14_ITEM8_P51_S3	Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are recorded in income tax expense.
714603_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Foreign currency translation The Company's international subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency.
714603_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	The Company translates its assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates, except for those accounts where historical rates are acceptable.
714603_14_ITEM8_P52_S2	Income and expense accounts are translated at average rates during the period.
714603_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	Diluted earnings per share are determined by including the dilutive effect of all potential common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Derivative and hedging activities Authoritative accounting guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities.
714603_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value and that the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
714603_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	From time to time, the Company utilizes derivatives to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
714603_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Company does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes.
714603_14_ITEM8_P55_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company had derivative instruments outstanding which are described in Note 11 of these financial statements.
714603_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	Comprehensive income The Company's comprehensive income consists of net income and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, the Company's proportional share of unconsolidated affiliates' other comprehensive income (limited by the carrying value of the investment), unrealized gains or losses on the Company's cash flow hedges and foreign currency translation adjustments which are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income net of tax and reclassifications to earnings.
714603_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	Share-based compensation The Company has share-based compensation plans covering its employees and its non-employee directors and has outstanding share awards (primarily in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units) under each of these plans.
714603_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards offset by estimates of compensation costs related to awards that are not expected to vest.
714603_14_ITEM8_P57_S2	For share-based awards granted, the Company expenses the grant date fair value of these awards using the straight-line method over the service period.
714603_14_ITEM8_P57_S3	Amortization for the grant date fair value of share-based awards containing both service and performance features depends on the Company's estimated judgments on whether the performance conditions will be achieved.
714603_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standard update, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
714603_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	This standard requires netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions.
714603_14_ITEM8_P58_S2	This standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
714603_14_ITEM8_P58_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard but does not expect it to materially impact the consolidated financial statements.
714603_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	On January 1, 2013, DST adopted new authoritative accounting guidance that modifies the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
714603_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	The standard requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in the consolidated statement of income if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety to net income.
714603_14_ITEM8_P59_S2	For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference to other required disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts.
714603_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.
714603_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	See Note 13 for enhanced disclosures provided as a result of the new standard.

714603_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company does not believe that any of the above mentioned business combinations are material to DST's consolidated financial statements.

714603_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	The Company's 2013 annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units substantially exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units.
714603_14_ITEM8_P112_S0	During 2012, the decreased demand resulting from economic conditions in the U.K. economy negatively impacted production volumes and operating revenues in the U.K. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2012, DST adjusted its future outlook and related strategy with respect to the Customer Communications U.K. operations which resulted in a reduction in future expected cash flows.
714603_14_ITEM8_P112_S1	Based upon these revised future cash flow projections, the 2012 goodwill impairment test indicated that the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value.

714603_14_ITEM8_P117_S4	The Company believes increases in the level of assumed interest rates and/or credit losses compared to assumptions in effect at the balance sheet date by 10% or 20% would not materially affect the fair value of the retained interest at the reporting date.

714603_14_ITEM8_P150_S0	The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to future cash flows is typically one to two years.
714603_14_ITEM8_P150_S1	During 2013 , the Company entered into a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that DST's net cash outflows from intercompany purchases of services from its international subsidiaries that could be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

714603_14_ITEM8_P163_S2	Since these net operating losses were generated by an entity prior to its acquisition by DST, their utilization is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
714603_14_ITEM8_P163_S3	The Company does not anticipate that such limitations will prohibit the utilization of the federal net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration.
714603_14_ITEM8_P163_S4	The Company has approximately $26.0 million of state net operating losses as of December 31, 2013 as a result of previous business combinations.

714603_14_ITEM8_P164_S0	The Company has approximately $55.8 million of net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2013 in international jurisdictions.
714603_14_ITEM8_P164_S1	These carryforwards do not expire but may be limited in their ability to offset only certain income.
714603_14_ITEM8_P164_S2	A net benefit of approximately $8.1 million of these net operating losses will be recorded in additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon realization.
714603_14_ITEM8_P165_S0	Authoritative accounting guidance requires a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
714603_14_ITEM8_P165_S1	In evaluating the realizability of certain international net deferred tax assets, the Company also anticipates that limitations may result in the benefit of these amounts not being realized and has established corresponding valuation allowances as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 of $10.2 million and $14.6 million , respectively.
714603_14_ITEM8_P166_S0	Prior to 1993, the Company generally did not provide deferred income taxes for unremitted earnings of certain investees accounted for under the equity method because those earnings have been and will continue to be reinvested indefinitely.
714603_14_ITEM8_P166_S1	Beginning in 1993, pursuant to the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance related to income taxes, the Company began providing deferred taxes for unremitted earnings of U.S. unconsolidated affiliates net of the 80% dividends received deduction provided for under current tax law.
714603_14_ITEM8_P166_S2	Through December 31, 2013 , the cumulative amount of such unremitted earnings was $73.2 million .
714603_14_ITEM8_P166_S3	These amounts would become taxable to the Company if distributed by the affiliates as dividends, in which case the Company would be entitled to the dividends received deduction for 80% of the dividends; alternatively, these earnings could be realized by the sale of the affiliates' stock, which would give rise to tax at federal capital gains rates and state ordinary income tax rates, to the extent the stock sale proceeds exceeded the Company's tax basis.
714603_14_ITEM8_P166_S4	Deferred taxes provided on unremitted earnings through December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $5.9 million and $14.7 million , respectively.

714603_14_ITEM8_P194_S0	The Company estimates expected stock price volatility via observations of the historical (generally the last three years) volatility trends.
714603_14_ITEM8_P194_S1	In determining the expected life of the option grants, the Company applied the simplified method, which uses the weighted average of the vesting period and contractual term of each option granted.
714603_14_ITEM8_P194_S2	The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Government zero-coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option as of the option grant date.

714603_14_ITEM8_P198_S1	Grants of restricted stock are valued at the date of grant based on the value of DST's common stock and are expensed using the straight-line method over the service period or, in the case of performance based vesting awards, over the expected period to achieve the required performance criteria.
714603_14_ITEM8_P198_S2	Except for restrictions placed on the transferability of the restricted stock, holders of RSAs have full stockholders rights during the term of restriction, including voting rights and the right to receive cash dividends, if any.
714603_14_ITEM8_P198_S3	In 2010, the Company began issuing RSUs which do not confer full stockholder rights such as voting rights and cash dividends, but provide for additional dividend equivalent RSU awards in lieu of cash dividends.

714603_14_ITEM8_P199_S1	Included in the non-vested shares of outstanding RSUs at December 31, 2013 are approximately 0.3 million of restricted shares granted that contain both service and performance features (based on the achievement of certain operating performance measures).
714603_14_ITEM8_P199_S2	In addition, the non-vested shares of RSUs at December 31, 2013 contain 0.1 million of performance stock units ( PSUs ).
714603_14_ITEM8_P199_S3	Management judgment is required to estimate amortization expense during the service period associated with both PSUs and RSUs containing performance features.
714603_14_ITEM8_P199_S4	The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate its assumptions for its performance-based awards and PSUs over the applicable performance periods for these awards.
714603_14_ITEM8_P199_S5	During 2012, a portion of its U.K. performance-based equity awards were determined to be unlikely to achieve the required performance criteria applicable to these awards resulting in a reversal of total accumulated amortization of $2.5 million related to these awards.
714603_14_ITEM8_P200_S0	Summary restricted stock activity is presented in the table below (shares in millions):
714603_14_ITEM8_P201_S0	The fair values of RSAs and RSUs which vested during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $31.5 million , $11.5 million and $2.1 million , respectively.

714603_14_ITEM8_P201_S2	The Company estimates that the amortized compensation expense attributable to the stock option and restricted stock grants will be approximately $10.1 million for 2014 , $7.2 million for 2015 , and $1.0 million in 2016, based on awards currently outstanding.
714603_14_ITEM8_P201_S3	Future amortization is not projected on approximately $3.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense as the related awards are not currently expected to achieve their required performance features and therefore are not expected to vest.

714603_14_ITEM8_P202_S2	The purchase price for shares under any stock offering is to be 85% of the average market price on either the exercise date or the offering date, whichever is lower.
714603_14_ITEM8_P202_S3	At December 31, 2013 , there were approximately 0.6 million shares available for future offerings.

714603_14_ITEM8_P205_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Rights Plan, each share of the Company's outstanding common stock has received one Right (as defined in the Rights Plan).
714603_14_ITEM8_P205_S1	Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company 1/1000ths of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, or in some circumstances, shares of the Company's Common Stock, other securities, cash or other assets, at a purchase price of $225 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
714603_14_ITEM8_P205_S2	In the event a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Plan), the Rights will entitle each holder of a Right to purchase, for the purchase price, that number of common shares equivalent to the number of common shares which at the time of the transaction would have a market value of twice the purchase price.
714603_14_ITEM8_P205_S3	Any Rights that are at any time beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Plan) will be null and void and nontransferable and any holder of any such Right will be unable to exercise or transfer any such Right.
714603_14_ITEM8_P205_S4	At any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, but before a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the common shares, the Board of Directors may elect to exchange each Right for consideration per Right consisting of one-half of the number of common shares that would be issuable at such time on the exercise of one Right and without payment of the purchase price.
714603_14_ITEM8_P205_S5	Under certain circumstances, the Company may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price of $0.0025 per Right.

714603_14_ITEM8_P206_S1	The Rights Plan is intended to encourage a potential acquiring person to negotiate directly with the Board of Directors, but may have certain anti-takeover effects.
714603_14_ITEM8_P206_S2	The Rights Plan could significantly dilute the interests in the Company of an Acquiring Person.

714603_14_ITEM8_P232_S0	The Customer Communications Segment leases its California, Connecticut and Missouri production facilities from the Investments and Other Segment, but the Company reports financial results for the Customer Communications Segment on the basis that the Customer Communications Segment owns its production facilities.
714603_14_ITEM8_P232_S1	Management believes reporting Customer Communications on this basis improves its ability to analyze the Customer Communications Segment operating results taking into consideration the special purpose nature of the production plants.

714603_14_ITEM15_P27_S3	WHEREAS, because of the Plan's grandfathered status under Section 409A, the Plan currently provides that any modification to the Plan is null and void unless such modification specifically provides that it is intended to be a "material modification" within the meaning of Section 409A; WHEREAS, the Board desires to amend the Plan to provide that the Plan will distribute each Plan participant's entire Plan benefit in a single, lump-sum payment in 2014, resulting in a complete liquidation of all Plan accounts; WHEREAS, the Board intends that the contemplated amendment be a "material modification" to the Plan within the meaning of Section 409A; WHEREAS, the Plan may be amended pursuant to section 10.2 of the Plan by a favorable vote of two-thirds of the members of the Board who are not participants in the Plan; WHEREAS, each Plan participant's Plan benefit will be valued as of the last day of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the date on which the distribution payment in 2014 is made; and WHEREAS, although the Board anticipates that all distributions will be made around April 15, 2014 with the distribution amount equal to each Plan participant's account balance as of March 31, 2014, the payment date for purposes of Section 409A shall be considered 2014, and not any specific day during such year.

714603_14_ITEM15_P30_S3	Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, this Plan shall not be amended in any manner that would cause the Plan or any amounts payable hereunder to fail to comply with the requirements of Section 409A, to the extent applicable and the provisions of any purported amendment that may reasonably be expected to result in such non-compliance shall be of no force or effect with respect to the Plan.

714603_15_ITEM1_P8_S3	Our competitors are primarily financial institutions and in-house systems.
714603_15_ITEM1_P8_S4	Our financial institution competitors may have an advantage because they can take into consideration the value of their clients funds on deposit or under management when pricing their services.

714603_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	We consider our data centers and surrounding property to be specialized operational assets and do not consider them to be real estate assets.
714603_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	Therefore, our data centers are not included in our real estate operations, but rather in the Financial Services segment.

714603_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Many of these are beyond our control.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	A description follows of some of the important factors that could have a material negative impact on our future business, operating and financial results, cash flows, financial condition, prospects or share price.

714603_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	You should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 .

714603_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The level of importance of each of the following trends and risks may vary from time to time, and the trends and risks are not listed in any specific order of importance.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	These risks are not the only risks facing our Company.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or share price.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Trends or events affecting our clients or their industries could decrease the demand for our products and services and the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our significant customers could materially harm our business and results of operations.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We derive our revenues from the delivery of products and services to clients in the mutual fund, brokerage, investment management, healthcare, telecommunications, video and utilities, other financial service (i.e. insurance, banking and financial planning) and other industries.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Demand for our products and services among companies in those industries could decline for many reasons.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If demand for our products decreases or any of the industries we serve decline or fail or consolidate, reducing the number of potential clients, our business and our operating results could be adversely affected.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	On a consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2014, our five largest customers (excluding Boston Financial Data Services, our 50%-owned joint venture with State Street) accounted for approximately 17% of our consolidated operating revenues.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	For the same period, the Healthcare Services segment s five largest customers accounted for approximately 49% of our revenue in that segment, including 17.1% from its largest customer.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Because of our significant customer concentration, particularly in the Healthcare Services segment, our revenue could fluctuate significantly due to changes in economic conditions, the use of competitive products, or the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our significant customers, and a delay or default in payment by any significant customer could materially harm our business and results of operations.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Events that adversely affect our clients businesses, rates of growth or numbers of customers they serve could decrease demand for our products and services and the number of transactions we process.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	businesses include decreased demand for our customers products and services, adverse conditions in our customers markets or adverse economic conditions generally.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We may be unsuccessful in predicting the needs of changing industries and whether potential customers will accept our products or services.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We also may invest in technology or infrastructure for specific customers and not realize additional revenue from such investments.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	If trends or events do not occur as we expect, our business could be negatively impacted.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Mergers or acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S7	The adverse effects of consolidation could be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, such as in the financial services or healthcare services sectors.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S9	The Securities and Exchange Commission may issue regulations impacting third-party distributors of mutual funds, which could adversely affect our business.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S10	The SEC may issue regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Dodd-Frank Act ) or other legislative authority that would require brokers and financial intermediaries that distribute mutual funds to make more detailed fee disclosures at the point-of-sale.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P5_S11	Additionally, brokers and financial intermediaries may become subject to new fiduciary standards-of-care that could cause them to alter their methods of distribution.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We cannot predict the requirements the SEC may propose and finally adopt.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Regulations that would cause current distribution channels or interest in mutual fund investing to change could decrease the number of accounts on our systems as a result of changes in client offerings or the attractiveness of offerings to customers of our clients.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	This could adversely affect our business and operating results.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Additionally, to the extent the Dodd-Frank Act impacts the operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business, those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs, reduce their capacity to transact, or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems could result in significant costs and reputational damage.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We have developed and maintained, and our businesses depend on, information technology infrastructure, including elements both internal and external, to record and process a large volume of complex transactions and other data, including personally identifiable information regarding financial and health matters.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In certain circumstances, vendors have access to such data in order to assist us with responsibilities, such as producing benefit plan identification cards, maintaining software we license on our own behalf or resell to others, or helping clients comply with anti-money laundering regulations.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	A breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers or our employees intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In recent years several financial services firms were victims of computer systems hacking attacks, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data, and reputational harm.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Rapid advances in technology, and the limits and costs of technology, skills and manpower, may prevent us from anticipating, identifying, preventing or addressing all potential security threats and breaches.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Any interruptions, delays, breakdowns or breach, including as a result of cybersecurity breaches, of our, or of our vendors , information technology infrastructure, including improper employee actions, could result in the loss of confidential, personal or proprietary information.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues, regulatory penalties, and litigation.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	An increase in subaccounting services performed by brokerage firms has and will continue to adversely impact our revenues.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We service mutual fund and other accounts under shareowner recordkeeping arrangements which we refer to as registered accounts.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	These arrangements are distinguished from broker subaccounts, which are serviced under contract with a broker/dealer.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our clients may adopt the broker subaccount structure.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We offer subaccounting services to brokerage firms that perform shareowner subaccounting.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	As the recordkeeping functions in connection with subaccounting are more limited than traditional shareowner accounting, the fees charged are generally lower on a per unit basis.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Brokerage firms that obtain agreements from our clients to use a broker subaccount structure cause accounts currently on our traditional recordkeeping system to convert to our subaccounting system, or to the subaccounting systems of other service providers, which generally results in lower revenues.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P10_S6	While subaccounting conversions have generally been limited to our non tax-advantaged mutual fund accounts, such conversions have begun to extend to the tax-advantaged accounts (such as retirement and Section 529 accounts) we service, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The demand for our products and services could decrease if we do not continually address our clients technology and capacity requirements.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our clients use technology-based products and services in the complex and rapidly changing markets in which they operate.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We must substantially invest in technology and systems to meet customer requirements for technology and capacity.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If we do not meet clients technology and capacity requirements in advance of our competitors or if the investments we make are not cost-effective or do not result in successful products or services, our business could be adversely affected.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The quality or availability of postal system services could decrease, reducing the volume of printed customer communications and negatively impacting our business.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We are dependent on postal delivery systems for final delivery of printed customer communications.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Postal delivery systems are facing economic pressures from the reduction in First-Class mail and certain postal delivery systems have experienced work stoppages and other interruptions.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Accuracy and speed of delivery are important factors for clients using printed communications in their businesses.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Changes in the timeliness and quality of postal delivery could negatively impact the level of printed communications delivered by our customers to their clients.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	A decrease in such communications could adversely affect our business and our operating results.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Decreasing demand for traditional printed and mailed communications may continue to adversely affect our business, depending on the extent to which our customers and their clients acceptance of electronic alternatives continues to grow.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	To the extent our clients customers select electronic presentment and delivery of communications, the demand for our services for production and distribution of printed documents has decreased and could continue to decrease.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	We provide electronic presentment and delivery solutions, but they are priced differently and require different capabilities than print-mail solutions.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Customers may choose to perform electronic hosting and distribution of communications to customers internally or select electronic solution providers other than us.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S7	In particular, clients have terminated their services or moved production in-house.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S8	This has and could continue to adversely affect our business and our operating results.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Damage to our facilities could impact our operations or financial condition.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S10	The performance of our services also depends upon facilities that house central computer operations or operating centers or in which we process information, images, bills or statements.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Significant damage to any of our operating facilities could interrupt the operations at those facilities and interfere with our ability to serve customers.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S12	We may be unable to attract and retain capable technical personnel for our processing businesses or quality executives to manage the complex structure of our business.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Our success depends on recruiting and retaining adept management and personnel with expertise in software and systems development and the types of computer hardware and software we utilize.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S14	If we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel, our operations could be materially adversely affected.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S15	Companies in our industry compete fiercely for qualified management and technical personnel.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S16	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately compete for or keep qualified personnel.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S17	If we lack qualified management, there is an increased risk that we will adopt unfavorable business strategies, especially in a complex business like ours with multiple segments and operating entities.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S18	If we lack qualified technical personnel, our ability to develop the systems and services our clients demand may also be negatively affected.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S19	Our businesses are subject to substantial competition.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S20	We are subject to intense competition from other established service providers in all industries we serve.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S21	Some of our competitors are able to bundle service offerings and offer more appealing pricing structures.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S22	Some of our clients, or the clients they serve, may develop, have developed or are developing the in-house capacity to perform the transaction processing, recordkeeping and output services they have paid us to perform.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S23	Additionally, some of our competitors and clients have greater financial and human resources and access to capital than we do.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S24	Our failure to successfully compete in any of our material operating businesses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P14_S25	Competition could also affect the revenue mix of services we provide, resulting in decreased revenues in lines of business with higher profit margins.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We and our unconsolidated affiliates are subject to regulation.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Any regulatory violations, changes or uncertainties could adversely affect our business.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	A number of our businesses are subject to U.S. or foreign regulation, including privacy, licensing, processing, recordkeeping, investment adviser, broker/dealer, reporting and related regulations.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Such regulations cover all aspects of our businesses including, but not limited to, sales and trading methods, trade practices among broker/dealers, use and safekeeping of customers funds and securities, capital structure of securities firms, net capital, anti-money laundering efforts, record keeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Any violation of applicable regulations could expose us or those businesses to civil or criminal liability, significant fines or sanctions, damage our reputation, the revocation of licenses, censures, or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, which could adversely affect our business or our financial results.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Governmental changes and uncertainties surrounding services we provide could increase our costs of business or diminish business, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Our clients are subject to regulation that could affect our business.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our clients are subject to extensive regulation, including investment adviser, broker/dealer and privacy regulations applicable to services we provide to the financial services industry and insurance, privacy and other regulations applicable to services we provide to the healthcare industry.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Changes in, and any violation by our clients of, applicable laws and regulations (whether related to the services we provide or otherwise) could diminish their business or financial condition and thus their demand for our products and services or could increase our cost of continuing to provide services to such industries.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Demand could also decrease if we do not continue to offer products and services that help our clients comply with regulations.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S10	For example, our accounts in our Healthcare Services segment are impacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ), including the Health Insurance Marketplace.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The implementation the ACA is still in its early stages, and we cannot predict the impact it will have on our customers and their demand for our services.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S12	We operate internationally and are thus exposed to currency fluctuations and foreign political, economic and other conditions that could adversely affect our revenues from or support by foreign operations.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S13	Inherent risks in our international business activities could decrease our international sales and also could adversely affect our ability to receive important support from our international operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S14	These risks include potentially unfavorable foreign economic conditions, political conditions or national priorities, foreign government regulation, potential expropriation of assets by foreign governments, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, the failure to bridge cultural differences, and limited or prohibited access to our foreign operations and the support they provide.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P15_S15	We may also have difficulty repatriating any profits or be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in our international business.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Various events may cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The nature of these events might inhibit our ability to anticipate and act in advance to counter them.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We may be unsuccessful in determining or controlling when and whether events occur that could cause varying financial results.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Unfavorable results may occur that we did not anticipate or take advance action to address.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	The various reasons our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate include unanticipated economic conditions, and costs for starting up significant client operations, for hiring staff, and for developing products.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Our results may also vary as a result of pricing pressures, increased cost of supplies, timing of license fees, the evolving and unpredictable markets in which our products and services are sold, changes in accounting principles, and competitors new products or services.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Investment decisions with respect to cash balances, market returns or losses on investments, and limits on insurance applicable to cash balances held in bank and brokerage accounts, including those held by us and as agent on behalf of our clients, could expose us to losses of such cash balances and adversely affect revenues attributable to cash balance deposit investments.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As part of our transaction processing and other services, we maintain and manage large bank and investment accounts containing client funds, which we hold as agent, as well as operational funds.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our revenues include investment earnings related to client fund cash balances.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our choices in selecting investments, or market conditions that affect the rate of return on or the availability of investments, could have an adverse effect on the level of such revenues.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	The amounts held in our operational and client deposit accounts could exceed the limits of government insurance programs of organizations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation, exposing us to the risk of loss.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any such loss would have an adverse impact on our business and our financial condition.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our revenues could decrease if client contracts are terminated or fail to renew or if clients renegotiate contracts or utilize our services at lower than anticipated levels.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We derive most of our revenue by selling products and services under long-term contracts, many of which contain terms and conditions based on anticipated levels of utilization of our services.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot unilaterally extend the terms of our client contracts when they expire.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Contracts can terminate during the term of agreement for various reasons, including through termination for convenience clauses in some contracts that enable clients to cancel by written notice.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our revenues could decrease as a result of terminations or non-renewals of client contracts; extensions of client contracts under, or contract re-negotiations resulting in, less favorable terms; or utilization of services at less than anticipated levels.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Our businesses expose us to risks of claims and losses that could be significant and damage our reputation and business prospects.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Our proprietary applications and related consulting and other services include the processing or clearing of financial and healthcare transactions for our clients and their customers and the design of benefit plans and compliance programs.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	The dollar amount of transactions processed or cleared is vastly higher than the revenues we derive from providing these services.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	In the event we make transaction processing or operational errors, or mismanage any process, we could be exposed to claims for any resulting processing delays, disclosure of protected information, miscalculations, mishandling of pass-through disbursements or other processes, and failure to follow a client s instructions or meet specifications.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Additionally, we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from a failure of third parties (including regulatory authorities) to recognize the limitations of our role as our clients agent or consultant, and we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from fraud committed by third parties.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S9	We may be exposed to the risk of counterparty breaches or failure to perform.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S10	We may be subject to claims, including class actions, for reimbursements, losses or damages arising from any transaction processing or operational error, or from process mismanagement.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Because of the sensitive nature of the financial and healthcare transactions we process, our liability and any alleged damages may significantly exceed the fees we receive for performing the service at issue.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Litigation could include class action claims based, among other theories, upon various regulatory requirements and consumer protection and privacy laws that class action plaintiffs may attempt to use to assert private rights of action.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Any of these claims and related settlements or judgments could affect our operating results, damage our reputation, decrease demand for our services, or cause us to make costly operating changes.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We are substantially dependent on our intellectual property rights, and a claim for infringement or a requirement to indemnify a client for infringement could adversely affect us.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We have made substantial investments in software and other intellectual property on which our business is highly dependent.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the U.S. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S9	To the extent available, we rely on patent, trade secret and copyright laws; however, significant portions of our proprietary intellectual property is not protected by patents.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S10	We also utilize nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and security measures to protect our proprietary technology.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S11	We cannot guarantee these measures will be effective.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Our products and services rely on technology developed by others, including open source software, and we have no control over possible infringement of someone else s intellectual property rights by the provider of this technology.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S13	The owner of the rights could seek damages from us rather than or in addition to the persons who provide the technology to us.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S14	We could be subject at any time to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to evaluate and defend.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S15	Our clients may also face infringement claims, allege that such claims relate to our products and services, and seek indemnification from us.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P21_S16	Any loss of our intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights of others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We do not control certain businesses in which we have significant ownership.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We invest in joint ventures and other unconsolidated affiliates as part of our business strategy, and part of our net income is derived from our pro rata share of the earnings of those businesses.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Despite owning significant equity interests in those companies and having directors on their boards, we do not control their operations, strategies or financial decisions.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The other owners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the businesses we co-own.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Our pro rata share of any losses due to unfavorable performance of those companies could negatively impact our financial results.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Some of our joint venture investments are subject to buy-sell agreements, which could, among other things, restrict us from selling our interests even if we were to determine it would be prudent to do so.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S6	We own interests in unconsolidated entities including Boston Financial Data Services, International Financial Data Services Limited Partnership, International Financial Data Services Limited, and various real estate joint ventures.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Our interests in such unconsolidated entities are subject to buy/sell arrangements, which could restrict our ability to sell our interests even if we were to determine it would be prudent to do so.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S8	These arrangements could also allow us to purchase the other owners interests to prevent someone else from acquiring them and we cannot control the timing of occasions to do so.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S9	The businesses or other owners may encourage us to increase our investment in or make contributions to the businesses at an inopportune time.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Our investments in funds and in other companies could decline in value.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S11	We hold significant investments in available-for-sale equity securities of other companies, primarily State Street Corporation, and other financial interests that are subject to fluctuations in market prices.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S12	A significant decline in the value of our equity investments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P22_S13	We may not always be able to sell those investments at higher prices than we paid for them or than the value of the consideration used to acquire them.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	From time to time ALPS adds new investment strategies to its investment product offerings by providing the initial cash investments as seed capital.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The seed capital investments may decline in value.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	A significant decline in their value could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are a limited partner in various private equity funds and have future capital commitments related to certain private equity fund investments.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Generally, private equity fund securities are non-transferable or are subject to long holding periods, and withdrawals from the private equity firm partnerships are typically not permitted.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Even when transfer restrictions do not apply, there is generally no public market for the securities.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Therefore, we may not be able to sell the securities at a time when we desire to do so.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	We may not always be able to sell those investments at higher prices than we paid for them.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Various plans, agreements, laws and organizational documents may have anti-takeover effects.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, certain plans and agreements, and applicable laws could make it more difficult for a party to make a tender offer for our shares or complete a takeover, which is not approved by our Board of Directors.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	legal restrictions on business combinations with certain stockholders.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Because of contractual commitments, a change in control could affect our operating results and weaken our management retention and incentive tools.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	A change in control of the Company would trigger various rights and obligations in service agreements with our customers and in agreements governing our joint ventures.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	A change in control could also allow some clients to terminate their agreements with us or to obtain rights to use our processing software.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are parties to joint venture agreements that allow other co-owners to buy our equity interests if we undergo a change in control.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	agreements) after a change in control could accelerate funding, payment or vesting of equity grants, as applicable, under such agreements and programs.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	This accelerated funding, vesting or payment may decrease an employee s incentive to continue employment with us.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We have adopted an executive severance plan which, among other things, provides benefits to participating senior officers and executives who are terminated in connection with a change of control.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Certain other executive officers have agreements with us that require us to continue to employ them for three years after a change in control or to pay certain amounts if we terminate their employment without cause or they resign for good reason following a change in control.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	The executives might not be incented to achieve desired results for the new owners of our business, and the cost of keeping the executives on the payroll might deter potential new owners from acquiring us or hinder new owners from hiring replacement management.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Our equity incentive and stockholders rights plans could have a dilutive effect on our common stock.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Our directors, officers and certain managers have received restricted stock units and options to purchase our common stock as part of their compensation.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P29_S7	These equity grants could have a dilutive effect on our common stock.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P29_S8	The rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock (as determined pursuant to the rights plan) without the approval of our Board of Directors.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P29_S9	A triggering of the rights plan could in some circumstances be dilutive in value to common stockholders who do not exercise their rights.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Future cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Payment of dividends is subject to applicable laws and to restrictions in applicable debt agreements.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	If we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited and our financial condition adversely affected.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our business strategy anticipates that we will supplement internal growth by pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We may be unable to identify suitable businesses to acquire.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	We compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other complementary businesses.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Information we obtain about an acquisition target may be limited and there can be no assurance that an acquisition will perform as expected or positively impact our financial performance.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Potential acquisitions involve risk, including the risk we would be unable to effectively integrate the acquired technologies, operations and personnel into our business, and the risk that management s attention and our capital would be diverted from other areas of our business.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P32_S6	The anticipated benefits of our acquisitions may not materialize.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the issuance of capital stock, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P32_S8	If we cannot complete acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
714603_15_ITEM1A_P32_S9	If our new investments and business initiatives are not successful, our financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.

714603_15_ITEM6_P1_S5	Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a useful basis for evaluating underlying business unit performance, but should not be considered in isolation and is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, evaluating business unit performance utilizing GAAP financial information.
714603_15_ITEM6_P1_S6	A description of the use of non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is below.
714603_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	In addition to reporting financial information on a GAAP basis, we have disclosed non-GAAP financial information which has been reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the following financial schedules titled Reconciliation of Reported Diluted Earnings per Share to Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share.
714603_15_ITEM6_P3_S0	In making these adjustments to determine the non-GAAP results, we take into account the impact of items that are not necessarily ongoing in nature, that do not have a high level of predictability associated with them or that are non-operational in nature.
714603_15_ITEM6_P3_S1	Generally, these items include net gains on dispositions of business units, net gains (losses) associated with securities and other investments, restructuring and impairment costs, and other similar items.
714603_15_ITEM6_P3_S2	Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a useful basis for evaluating underlying business unit performance, but should not be considered in isolation and is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, evaluating business unit performance utilizing GAAP financial information.
714603_15_ITEM6_P3_S3	Management uses non-GAAP measures in its budgeting and forecasting processes and to further analyze our financial trends and operational run-rate, as well as making financial comparisons to prior periods presented on a similar basis.
714603_15_ITEM6_P3_S4	We believe that providing such adjusted results allows investors and other users of our financial statements to better understand our comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
714603_15_ITEM6_P3_S5	DST s management uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures in its own evaluation of our performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods.
714603_15_ITEM6_P3_S6	Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.
714603_15_ITEM6_P3_S7	Although our management believes non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the performance of our business, we acknowledge that items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on our financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP.
714603_15_ITEM6_P3_S8	Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP results.
714603_15_ITEM6_P3_S9	These factors should be considered when evaluating our results.

714603_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Investments and Other segment derives part of its income from its pro rata share in the earnings (losses) of certain unconsolidated affiliates.
714603_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	We pay lease payments to certain real estate joint ventures.
714603_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Seasonality Generally, we do not have significant seasonal fluctuations in our business operations.
714603_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	Processing volumes for mutual fund customers within our Financial Services and Customer Communications segment are usually highest during the quarter ended March 31 due primarily to processing year-end transactions and printing and mailing of year-end statements and tax forms during January.
714603_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	We have historically added operating equipment in the last half of the year in preparation for processing year-end transactions, which has the effect of increasing costs for the second half of the year.
714603_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	Revenues and operating results from individual license sales vary depending on the timing and size of the contracts.
714603_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standard update, Consolidated (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.
714603_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	The new consolidation guidance changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a variable interest entity ( VIE ), and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE.
714603_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	It also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities.
714603_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	The guidance is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
714603_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
714603_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
714603_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	This standard will replace the existing accounting standard for revenue recognition and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
714603_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	Early application of this standard is not permitted.
714603_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	This standard permits two transition approaches, either the retrospective transition method or the cumulative effect transition method.
714603_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	We are currently evaluating the standard, including which transition approach will be applied and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.
714603_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	This standard changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations and modifies the disclosure requirements.
714603_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	This standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods after December 15, 2014.
714603_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	Early adoption of the standard is permitted for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued.
714603_15_ITEM7_P14_S4	We elected to early adopt this standard beginning in the third quarter 2014.
714603_15_ITEM7_P14_S5	The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
714603_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	This standard requires netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions.
714603_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	This standard was effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
714603_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity.
714603_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	This standard requires the release of any cumulative translation adjustment into net income only upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of a controlling interest in a subsidiary or a group of assets within a foreign entity.
714603_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Also, it requires the release of all or a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment to net income in the case of a sale of an equity-method investment that is a foreign entity.
714603_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	This standard was effective prospectively beginning January 1, 2014.
714603_15_ITEM7_P16_S4	The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
714603_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
714603_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
714603_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
714603_15_ITEM7_P17_S4	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; software capitalization and amortization; depreciation of fixed assets; valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill; accounting for investments; and accounting for income taxes.
714603_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned.
714603_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	The majority of our revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided.
714603_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all customer obligations have been met.
714603_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	We generally do not have payment terms from customers that extend beyond one year.
714603_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	Revenue from operating leases is recognized monthly as the rent accrues.
714603_15_ITEM7_P18_S5	Billing for services in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.
714603_15_ITEM7_P18_S6	We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectibility is reasonably assured.
714603_15_ITEM7_P18_S7	If there is a customer-specific acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of customer acceptance.
714603_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
714603_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration should be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
714603_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence ( TPE ) such as how competitors have priced similar items.
714603_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	If such evidence is unavailable, we use our best estimate of the selling price ( BESP ), which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.
714603_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	We derive over 90% of our revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts.
714603_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	The majority of the amount is billed on a monthly basis, generally with thirty-day collection terms.
714603_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon performance of the services.
714603_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	In the event a portion of the arrangement fees are due 12 months or more from the invoice date, we have concluded that the fees do not meet the criteria for being fixed or determinable.
714603_15_ITEM7_P21_S4	In these cases, we recognize the revenue as the fees become due.
714603_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our standard business practice is to bill monthly for development, consulting and training services on a time and materials basis.
714603_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	In some cases we bill a fixed fee for development and consulting services.
714603_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	For fixed fee arrangements, we recognize revenue on a proportionate performance basis.
714603_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	We derive less than 10% of our revenues from licensing products.
714603_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	We license our wealth management products, AWD products, healthcare administration processing software solutions and customer billing software solution products.
714603_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Perpetual software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Term software license revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement.
714603_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	While license fee revenues are not a significant percentage of our total operations, they can significantly impact earnings in the period in which they are recognized.
714603_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Revenues from individual license sales depend heavily on the timing, size and nature of the contract.
714603_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	We recognize revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectibility has been reasonably assured.
714603_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	DST, through our wholly-owned subsidiary ALPS, may enter into arrangements with broker/dealers or other third parties to sell or market closed-end fund shares.
714603_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	Depending on the arrangement, ALPS may earn distribution fees for marketing and selling the underlying fund shares.
714603_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Conversely, ALPS may incur distribution expenses, including structuring fees, finders fees and referral fees paid to unaffiliated broker/dealers or introducing parties for marketing and selling underlying fund shares of a closed-end fund sponsored by ALPS.
714603_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	While distribution revenues and expenses are not significant percentages of our operating revenues or costs and expenses, they can significantly impact operations and earnings in the period in which they are recognized.
714603_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	We have entered into various agreements with related parties, principally unconsolidated affiliates, to utilize our data processing facilities and computer software systems.
714603_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	We believe that the terms of our contracts with related parties are fair to us and are no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties.
714603_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	We assess collection based on a variety of factors, including past collection history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer.
714603_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	We generally do not request collateral from our customers.
714603_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	If we determine that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.
714603_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	Allowances for billing adjustments and doubtful account expense are estimated as revenues are recognized.
714603_15_ITEM7_P29_S4	Allowances for billing adjustments are recorded as reductions in revenues and doubtful account expense is recorded within Costs and expenses.
714603_15_ITEM7_P29_S5	The annual amounts for these items are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Software capitalization and amortization We make substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of our processing services as well as our sale of licensed products.
714603_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	We also develop a large portion of our software internally.
714603_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	We capitalize software development costs for computer software developed or obtained for internal use after the preliminary project phase has been completed and management has committed to funding the project.
714603_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	For computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed to third parties, we capitalize software development costs which are incurred after the products reach technological feasibility but prior to the general release of the product to customers.
714603_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Significant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects.
714603_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Management specifically analyzes software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts, milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects.
714603_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Significant changes in any of these items may result in discontinuing capitalization of development costs, as well as immediately expensing previously capitalized costs.
714603_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	We review, on a quarterly basis, our capitalized software for possible impairment.
714603_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Depreciation of fixed assets Our approach on personal property, specifically technology equipment, printing and inserting equipment, is to own the property as opposed to leasing it where practicable.
714603_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	We believe this approach provides us with better flexibility for disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life.
714603_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	We depreciate technology equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives: (1) non-mainframe equipment three years; (2) mainframe central processing unit four years; and (3) mainframe direct access storage devices and tape devices five years.
714603_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	We depreciate furniture and fixtures over estimated useful lives, principally three to five years, using accelerated depreciation methods.
714603_15_ITEM7_P34_S4	We depreciate large printing and inserting equipment used by the Customer Communications segment over a five to seven year life using accelerated depreciation methods.
714603_15_ITEM7_P34_S5	We depreciate leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements.
714603_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Management judgment is required in assigning economic lives to fixed assets.
714603_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Management specifically analyzes fixed asset additions, remaining net book values and gain/loss upon disposition of fixed assets to determine the appropriateness of assigned economic lives.
714603_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	Significant changes in any of these items may result in changes in the economic life assigned and the resulting depreciation expense.
714603_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment.
714603_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	We evaluate the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and evaluate identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
714603_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	Factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy for the overall business; and significant negative industry or economic trends.
714603_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	When it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we assess actual impairment based on gross cash flows.
714603_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Our assessment of goodwill for impairment includes comparing the fair value to the net book value of our reporting units.
714603_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	We estimate fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches.
714603_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is necessary.
714603_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
714603_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	To measure the amount of any impairment loss, we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the affected reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
714603_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	Specifically, we allocate the fair value of the affected reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill.
714603_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.
714603_15_ITEM7_P38_S6	Our 2014 annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds its carrying value.
714603_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Accounting for investments We have three significant types of investments: 1) investments in available-for-sale securities, the largest of which is our investment in State Street common stock; 2) investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which is comprised principally of BFDS, IFDS U.K., IFDS L.P. and certain real estate joint ventures; and 3) investments in private equity funds and other investments accounted for under the cost method.
714603_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	We account for investments in entities in which we own less than 20% and do not have significant influence, in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, which requires us to designate our investments as trading or available-for-sale.
714603_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders equity.
714603_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	We record an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary.
714603_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our financial position.
714603_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	The equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities, partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where we are the limited partner) in which we have significant influence but do not control.
714603_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	We classify these investments as unconsolidated affiliates.
714603_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	Under the equity method, we recognize income or losses from our pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_15_ITEM7_P42_S3	In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of our investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_15_ITEM7_P42_S4	The cost method of accounting is used for these investments when we have a de-minimus ownership percentage and do not have significant influence.
714603_15_ITEM7_P42_S5	Our cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.
714603_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Accounting for income taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance.
714603_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns.
714603_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).
714603_15_ITEM7_P43_S3	In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.
714603_15_ITEM7_P43_S4	A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
714603_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for potential tax exposures based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be required.
714603_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, then we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary.
714603_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained if challenged by the taxing authorities.
714603_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected.
714603_15_ITEM7_P44_S5	An unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_15_ITEM7_P44_S6	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes.
714603_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Results of Operations The following table summarizes our consolidated operating results (millions, except per share amounts).
714603_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	Additional information regarding our segments is included below under the caption, Year to Year Business Segment Comparisons.
714603_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Revenues Consolidated total revenues (including out-of-pocket ( OOP ) reimbursements) increased $90.7 million or 3.4% during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013 and increased $82.0 million or 3.2% during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to December 31, 2012 .
714603_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	Consolidated operating revenues increased $81.4 million or 4.2% in 2014 as compared to 2013 and increased $68.2 million or 3.6% in 2013 as compared to 2012 .
714603_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	The operating revenue growth in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to increased operating revenues in the Financial Services and Healthcare Services segments, partially offset by a slight decline in operating revenues in the Customer Communications segment.
714603_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	The operating revenue growth in 2013 compared to 2012 was attributable to increased operating revenues in all three of our operating segments.
714603_15_ITEM7_P47_S4	Consolidated OOP reimbursements increased $9.3 million or 1.3% in 2014 as compared to 2013 and increased $13.8 million or 2.0% in 2013 as compared to 2012 .
714603_15_ITEM7_P47_S5	The net increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2014 is primarily attributable to new clients in the Customer Communications segment.
714603_15_ITEM7_P47_S6	The net increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2013 was attributable to higher volumes from new customers in the Customer Communications segment, partially offset by a decrease in the Financial Services segment attributable to lower registered accounts serviced.
714603_15_ITEM7_P47_S7	Costs and expenses Consolidated costs and expenses (including OOP reimbursements) increased $107.3 million or 4.9% during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013 and decreased $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to December 31, 2012 .
714603_15_ITEM7_P47_S8	Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $707.3 million in 2014 , an increase of $9.3 million as compared to 2013 and $698.0 million in 2013 , an increase of $13.8 million as compared to 2012 .
714603_15_ITEM7_P47_S9	Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, costs and expenses increased $98.0 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 and decreased $14.6 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 .
714603_15_ITEM7_P47_S10	On this basis, the increase in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to increased costs and expenses in the Financial Services and Healthcare Services segments, partially offset by decreased costs and expenses in the Customer Communications segment.
714603_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	As a result of market changes which have impacted our service offerings to clients, including lower registered account processing, we have implemented a restructuring initiative to reduce our workforce and consolidate certain facilities to enhance operational efficiency within the Financial Services and Customer Communications segments.

714603_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The effective tax rates in each of the three years ended December 31, 2014 were affected by tax benefits relating to certain international operations and recognition of state tax benefits associated with income apportionment rules.
714603_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	In addition, our income tax rate for 2014 was favorably impacted by the reversal of $30.3 million of uncertain tax position liabilities, net of additions, primarily related to statute expirations.
714603_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	Our effective income tax rate for 2013 was favorably impacted by a $16.1 million benefit from the completion of the IRS examination of previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 and research and experimentation credits for the periods 2006 through 2009.

714603_15_ITEM7_P60_S4	ALPS operating revenues increased over the comparable prior year periods as a result of net positive funds flow and favorable market conditions which have contributed to the growth of assets under management within the ALPS proprietary funds and increases in other ALPS distribution and services revenues.
714603_15_ITEM7_P60_S5	Also contributing to the increased operating revenues was an increase in subaccounts processed as a result of organic growth from existing clients and new clients.
714603_15_ITEM7_P60_S6	Excluding a $6.0 million contract termination payment received in 2013, our operating revenues from retirement solutions increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 principally from higher professional services fee revenue and higher participants as a result of the conversion of new clients.

714603_15_ITEM7_P60_S11	Global Solutions operating revenue decreased $9.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to one less month of operations in 2014.

714603_15_ITEM7_P63_S4	On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2014 was primarily from increased costs to support higher revenues, higher costs associated with the new business initiatives associated with the growth of ALPS asset gathering business, and investments to further develop the Applied Analytics and brokerage solutions service offerings.

714603_15_ITEM7_P63_S6	We also incurred higher restructuring charges and advisory and other transaction costs during 2014, primarily as a result of a $13.0 million charge resulting primarily from the restructuring event implemented during 2014 to reduce our workforce and consolidate certain facilities to enhance operational efficiency within the Financial Services segment and $5.6 million of advisory and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the agreement reached with Argyros in 2014.
714603_15_ITEM7_P63_S7	These increases in costs and expenses were partially offset by lower mark-to-market losses on deferred compensation liabilities (the effect of which is offset within other income), changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other foreign currencies and lower expenses associated with the fund launched by ALPS of $2.8 million in 2013 that did not recur in 2014.

714603_15_ITEM7_P86_S16	Additionally, income taxes payable increased $56.0 million during 2012 primarily attributable to the timing of tax payments on investment sales.
714603_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	We have had significant proceeds from the sale of investments during 2014, 2013 and 2012 which have been included within investing activities on the Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	The income taxes paid on the gains from these investment sales are required to be treated as an operating cash outflow.
714603_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	Income tax expense resulting from these investment sales will reduce operating cash flows in the period that taxes are paid.
714603_15_ITEM7_P87_S3	Income taxes paid related to gains on the sale of investments and other non-operating assets during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $70.4 million, $73.5 million and $78.9 million, respectively.

714603_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	Additionally, in 2014 cash flows from investing activities increased due to proceeds received from sale of Global Solutions of $77.4 million and proceeds from sale of non-operating real estate of $32.6 million .

714603_15_ITEM7_P89_S5	Additionally, in 2013 cash flows from investing activities increased $71.5 million due to lower restricted cash held for pharmacy processing client fund obligations.
714603_15_ITEM7_P89_S6	These cash inflows were partially offset by capital expenditures of $102.8 million .
714603_15_ITEM7_P89_S7	Cash flows provided by investing activities were $177.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $381.3 million , which includes $138.7 million of pretax proceeds from a privately-held investment and from the sale of Computershare, Euronet Worldwide and State Street stock.

714603_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	During 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , we capitalized software development costs of $28.8 million , $28.4 million , and $30.9 million , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	Additionally, we used debt to acquire approximately $2.5 million and $8.9 million of equipment during 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Capital expenditures using debt are treated as non-cash transactions and are not included in the annual capital expenditure amounts above.
714603_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures to total approximately $120.0 million.
714603_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	The approximately $7.0 million anticipated increase in 2015 capital expenditures is primarily attributable to planned updates of the generator plant at our data center.
714603_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded primarily by cash flows from operating activities or through borrowings on our revolving credit facilities.
714603_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	Financing Activities Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $528.0 million , $731.1 million and $346.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.

714603_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	The value of shares received in exchange for satisfaction of the exercise price and for tax-withholding obligations arising from the exercise of options to purchase our stock or from the vesting of restricted shares are included in Common stock repurchased in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	On January 29, 2014, the Board of Directors of DST authorized a $250.0 million share repurchase plan.
714603_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	We repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $200.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting in approximately $50.0 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan.
714603_15_ITEM7_P93_S2	During January 2015, we spent $50.0 million to purchase 0.5 million shares which completed the existing share repurchase plan.
714603_15_ITEM7_P93_S3	Under previous share repurchase plans, we expended $252.6 million for approximately 3.4 million shares and $73.7 million for approximately 1.3 million shares during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM7_P93_S4	On January 28, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new $250.0 million share repurchase plan, which allows, but does not require, the repurchase of common stock in open market and private transactions.
714603_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	As of March 23, 2014, Argyros beneficially owned 9.2 million shares or approximately 22% of DST common shares.
714603_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	During March 2014, we entered into an agreement under which we agreed to a two-step process to assist Argyros with the disposition of a substantial portion of its common stock ownership in DST.
714603_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	To implement Argyros disposition, we facilitated the May 2014 registered, secondary common stock offering of $450.0 million (before any overallotment option) of DST common stock beneficially owned by Argyros.
714603_15_ITEM7_P94_S3	Concurrent with the closing of the secondary offering and based upon a price determined in the secondary offering, DST repurchased, and simultaneously retired, 2.4 million shares of our common stock from Argyros for $200.0 million.
714603_15_ITEM7_P94_S4	In connection with this share repurchase, we recorded a non-cash gain of $18.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from the change in stock price between the date the share repurchase price became fixed and the settlement date.
714603_15_ITEM7_P94_S5	Dividends We paid cash dividends of $1.20 , $1.20 , and $0.80 per common share in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.

714603_15_ITEM7_P94_S8	Future cash dividends will depend upon financial condition, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
714603_15_ITEM7_P94_S9	Client Funds Obligations Client funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us.
714603_15_ITEM7_P94_S10	In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency client balances invested overnight.
714603_15_ITEM7_P94_S11	Client funds obligations represent liabilities that will be repaid within one year of the balance sheet date.
714603_15_ITEM7_P94_S12	We had $399.6 million , $366.5 million and $442.7 million of client funds obligations at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Debt Activity During 2014, we had the following primary sources of debt financing: our syndicated revolving credit facility; subsidiary line of credit facilities; term loan credit facilities; accounts receivable securitization program; privately placed senior notes (the Senior Notes and secured borrowings.
714603_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	We have also utilized bridge loans as necessary to augment the above sources of debt financing.
714603_15_ITEM7_P95_S2	We had $552.9 million , $683.0 million and $1,011.6 million of debt outstanding at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, a decrease of $130.1 million during 2014 and a decrease of $328.6 million during 2013 .
714603_15_ITEM7_P95_S3	The decrease in debt outstanding during 2014 was primarily from the repayment of the $125.0 million term loan credit facility in June 2014.
714603_15_ITEM7_P95_S4	Additionally in 2014, we renewed our accounts receivable securitization program resulting in a new maturity date of May 14, 2015 and on October 1, 2014, we replaced our existing revolving credit facility which had a scheduled maturity date of July 1, 2015.
714603_15_ITEM7_P95_S5	The new $850.0 million revolving credit facility has a maturity date of October 1, 2019.
714603_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	The decrease in debt outstanding during 2013 was primarily from the repayment of the real estate credit agreement upon maturity in September 2013 ($101.7 million), the repayment of the promissory note with BFDS ($107.0 million) and the redemption for cash of all remaining Convertible debentures ($90.1 million).
714603_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary indebtedness, asset dispositions and require certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	We are currently in compliance with these covenants.
714603_15_ITEM7_P97_S2	Our debt arrangements are described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
714603_15_ITEM7_P97_S3	The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	Interest obligations on our outstanding debt are not included in the table above.
714603_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	The revolving credit facility contains grid schedules that adjust borrowing costs up or down based upon our consolidated leverage ratio.
714603_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	The grid schedules may result in fluctuations in borrowing costs ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% over Eurodollar and 0.00% to 0.70% over base rate , as defined.
714603_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Senior Notes have fixed interest rates and are comprised of $40.0 million of 4.19% Series A Senior Notes, $105.0 million of 4.86% Series B Senior Notes, $65.0 million of 5.06% Series C Senior Notes and $160.0 million of 5.42% Series D Senior Notes.
714603_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	In addition to the financial instruments listed above, the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization program are determined based on variable interest rates associated with LIBOR.
714603_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	We have liabilities for income tax uncertainties of $80.1 million at December 31, 2014 .
714603_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	These obligations are classified as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as resolution of these matters is expected to take more than a year; however, the ultimate timing of resolution is uncertain.
714603_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	Other Commercial Commitments In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products and other business assets, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters.
714603_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties.
714603_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.
714603_15_ITEM7_P102_S3	Except for a $2.1 million liability established in connection with the indemnification of certain matters associated with the sale of a business and an $0.8 million liability recorded associated with a performance guarantee on a franchise agreement, which were accrued at December 31, 2014, no liabilities have been established for guarantees or indemnifications as it is not possible to determine either the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements or the timing of any such payments due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
714603_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	Historically, payments made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
714603_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.
714603_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	We believe that our guarantee arrangements will not have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures, capital resources, liquidity or results of operations.
714603_15_ITEM7_P105_S1	These arrangements are described above and in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Available-for-sale equity price risk Our investments in available-for-sale equity securities are subject to price risk.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The fair value of our available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $475.5 million .
714603_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The impact of a 10% change in fair value of these investments would be approximately $30.4 million to comprehensive income.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Changes in equity values of our investments have had and could have a material effect on our comprehensive income (loss) and financial position.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest rate risk We, and certain of our joint ventures, derive a certain amount of service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which we are the agent for clients.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The balances maintained in the bank accounts will fluctuate.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , DST and BFDS had average daily cash balances of approximately $1.9 billion maintained in such accounts, of which approximately $1.2 billion were maintained at BFDS.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We estimate that a 100 basis point change in interest earnings rate would equal approximately $6.7 million of net income (loss).
714603_15_ITEM7A_P1_S4	At December 31, 2014 , we had $552.9 million of debt, of which $164.3 million was subject to variable interest rates (Federal Funds rates, LIBOR rates, Prime rates).
714603_15_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Included in this amount are program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization program, which are determined based on variable interest rates associated with LIBOR.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P1_S6	We estimate that a 10% increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact to our consolidated pretax earnings or to the fair value of its debt.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P1_S7	The effect of changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt is mitigated by changes in interest rates attributable to balance earnings.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate risk The operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in our exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The principal currencies involved are the British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Thai baht and Indian rupee.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our international subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	We translate our assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and translate income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Currency exchange rate fluctuations have not historically significantly affected our consolidated financial results.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2014 , our international subsidiaries had approximately $337.8 million in total assets and for the year ended December 31, 2014 , these international subsidiaries recorded net income of approximately $44.3 million .
714603_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We estimate that a 10% change in exchange rates could change total consolidated assets by approximately $33.8 million .
714603_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Furthermore, a 10% change in exchange rates based upon historical earnings in international operations could change consolidated net income for 2014 by approximately $4.4 million .
714603_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We have entered into foreign currency cash flow and economic hedging programs to mitigate the impact of movements in foreign currency (principally British pound, Canadian dollar and Thai baht) on our operations.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The total notional value of our foreign currency derivatives is $99.1 million at December 31, 2014 .
714603_15_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $0.2 million at December 31, 2014 .
714603_15_ITEM7A_P6_S3	We estimate that a 10% change in exchange rates would result in a $0.7 million change in other comprehensive income.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $0.1 million at December 31, 2014 .
714603_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	We estimate a 10% change in exchange rates on these contracts would result in a $4.6 million change to consolidated net income.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P7_S2	Gains and losses on the derivative instruments are largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in a minimal impact on earnings.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Excluding the intercompany loans that have been hedged, we have approximately $44.0 million of unhedged intercompany loans as of December 31, 2014 with certain of our international subsidiaries that are expected to be repaid.
714603_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	We estimate that a 10% change in exchange rates on these unhedged intercompany loans would result in a $4.4 million change on net income.
714603_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Stockholders of DST Systems, Inc.:
714603_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DST Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

714603_15_ITEM8_P1_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
714603_15_ITEM8_P1_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
714603_15_ITEM8_P1_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
714603_15_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
714603_15_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
714603_15_ITEM8_P1_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
714603_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
714603_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

714603_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	Description of Business DST Systems, Inc. ( we , our , us , the Company or DST ) uses proprietary software applications to provide sophisticated information processing and servicing solutions through strategically unified business processing, data management, and customer communications solutions to clients globally within the asset management, brokerage, retirement, and healthcare markets.
714603_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	Our wholly-owned data centers provide the secure technology infrastructure support necessary to support our solutions offerings.
714603_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	We manage our business through our three operating segments, Financial Services, Healthcare Services, and Customer Communications.
714603_15_ITEM8_P9_S3	Investments in equity securities, private equity investments, real estate and certain financial interests have been aggregated into the Investments and Other segment.
714603_15_ITEM8_P9_S4	The consolidated financial statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company.
714603_15_ITEM8_P9_S5	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
714603_15_ITEM8_P9_S6	Certain amounts in the 2013 and 2012 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 presentation.
714603_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	We consolidate any entity in which we have a controlling financial interest.
714603_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	Under the voting interest model, generally the investor that has voting control (usually more than 50% of an entity s voting interests) consolidates the entity.
714603_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	Under the variable interest entity ( VIE ) model, the party that has the power to direct the entity s most significant economic activities and the ability to participate in the entity s economics consolidates the entity.
714603_15_ITEM8_P11_S2	An entity is considered a VIE if it possesses one of the following characteristics: 1) the entity is thinly capitalized; 2) residual equity holders do not control the entity; 3) equity holders are shielded from economic losses; 4) equity holders do not participate fully in an entity s residual economics; and 5) the entity was established with non-substantive voting interests.
714603_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	We have the following significant operating joint ventures: Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. ( BFDS International Financial Data Services, U.K. ( IFDS U.K. and International Financial Data Services, L.P. ( IFDS L.P. ).
714603_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	We do not have a controlling financial interest in these entities and therefore account for the operating results of these operating joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.
714603_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	We are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering a large portion of our Kansas City, Missouri-based leased office facilities.
714603_15_ITEM8_P12_S3	The lessors are generally joint ventures (in which we have a 50% ownership) that have been established specifically to purchase, finance and engage in leasing activities with the joint venture partners and unrelated third parties.
714603_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	Our analysis of our real estate joint ventures for all periods presented indicate that none qualified as a VIE and, accordingly, they have not been consolidated.
714603_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
714603_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
714603_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned.
714603_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	The majority of our revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided.
714603_15_ITEM8_P15_S2	Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all customer obligations have been met.
714603_15_ITEM8_P15_S3	We generally do not have payment terms from customers that extend beyond one year.
714603_15_ITEM8_P15_S4	Revenue from operating leases is recognized monthly as the rent accrues.
714603_15_ITEM8_P15_S5	Billing for services in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.
714603_15_ITEM8_P15_S6	Allowances for billing adjustments and doubtful account expense are estimated as revenues are recognized.
714603_15_ITEM8_P15_S7	Allowances for billing adjustments are recorded as reductions in revenues and doubtful account expense is recorded within Costs and expenses.
714603_15_ITEM8_P15_S8	The annual amounts for these items are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P15_S9	We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectibility is reasonably assured.
714603_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	If there is a customer-specific acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of customer acceptance.
714603_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
714603_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration should be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
714603_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence ( TPE ) such as how competitors have priced similar items.
714603_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	If such evidence is unavailable, we use our best estimate of the selling price ( BESP ), which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.
714603_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	Deferral of software license revenue results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	We recognize revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectibility has been reasonably assured.
714603_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket ( OOP ) expenses, such as postage and telecommunications charges, are recorded as revenue on an accrual basis.
714603_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	Because these additional revenues are offset by the reimbursable expenses incurred, they have minimal impact on income from operations and net income.
714603_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	For each segment, total revenues are reported in two categories, operating revenues and OOP reimbursements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P20_S3	OOP expenses are included in costs and expenses.
714603_15_ITEM8_P20_S4	Costs and expenses Costs and expenses include all costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, incurred to produce revenues.
714603_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	We believe that the nature of our business as well as our organizational structure, in which virtually all officers and associates have operational responsibilities, does not allow for a meaningful segregation of selling, general and administrative costs.
714603_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	These costs, which we believe to be immaterial, are also included in costs and expenses.
714603_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	Substantially all depreciation and amortization is directly associated with the production of revenues.
714603_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Cash equivalents Short-term liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents.
714603_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Due to the short-term nature of these investments, carrying value approximates market value.
714603_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Client funds/obligations Funds held on behalf of clients In connection with providing data processing services for our clients, we may hold client funds on behalf of transfer agency clients and pharmacy processing clients.
714603_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	End-of-day available client bank balances for full service mutual fund transfer agency clients are invested overnight.
714603_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	Invested balances are returned to the full service mutual fund transfer agency client accounts the following business day.
714603_15_ITEM8_P25_S2	Funds received from clients for the payment of pharmacy claims incurred by its members are invested until the claim payments are presented to the bank.
714603_15_ITEM8_P25_S3	These amounts are included in funds held on behalf of clients in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent assets that are restricted for use.
714603_15_ITEM8_P25_S4	Client funding receivable Client funding receivables represent amounts due to us for pharmacy claims paid in advance of receiving client funding and for pharmacy claims processed for which client funding requests have not been made.
714603_15_ITEM8_P25_S5	Client funds obligations Client funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us.
714603_15_ITEM8_P25_S6	In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency client balances invested overnight.
714603_15_ITEM8_P25_S7	Client funds obligations represent liabilities that will be repaid within one year of the balance sheet date.
714603_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	gross basis in the investing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	We have reported the cash inflows and outflows related to client fund investments on a net basis within net (increase) decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy clients fund obligations in the investing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	We have reported the cash flows related to client funds used in investing activities on a net basis within net increase (decrease) in client funds obligations in the financing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Inventories Inventories are comprised primarily of paper and envelope stocks.
714603_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
714603_15_ITEM8_P28_S2	Cost for substantially all of our inventories is determined on an average cost basis.
714603_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Investments The equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities, partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where we are the limited partner) in which we have significant influence but do not control.
714603_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	Under the equity method, we recognize income or losses from our pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_15_ITEM8_P29_S2	In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of our investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_15_ITEM8_P29_S3	The cost method of accounting is used for these investments when we have a de-minimus ownership percentage and do not have significant influence.
714603_15_ITEM8_P29_S4	Our cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.
714603_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Investments classified as available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income.
714603_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Investments in trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.
714603_15_ITEM8_P30_S2	Investments classified as held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
714603_15_ITEM8_P30_S3	Security transactions and investment income Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date.
714603_15_ITEM8_P30_S4	Security gains and losses are calculated on the specific identification method.
714603_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.
714603_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	Interest income, adjusted for discounts and premiums, is recorded on the accrual basis.
714603_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	Property and equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost with major additions and improvements capitalized.
714603_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	Cost includes the amount of interest cost associated with significant capital additions.
714603_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Depreciation of buildings is recorded using the straight-line method over 30 to 40 years.
714603_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	Technology equipment, furniture, fixtures and other equipment are depreciated using accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives, principally three to five years.
714603_15_ITEM8_P32_S2	Software is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, generally three to five years.
714603_15_ITEM8_P32_S3	We depreciate large printing and inserting equipment used by the Customer Communications segment using accelerated methods over a five to seven year life.
714603_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	We review, on a quarterly basis, our property and equipment for possible impairment.
714603_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	We capitalize costs for the development of internal use software, including coding and software configuration costs and costs of upgrades and enhancements, after the preliminary project phase has been completed and management has committed to funding the project.
714603_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis, depending on the nature of the project, generally over a three to five year period.
714603_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	We review, on a quarterly basis, our capitalized software for possible impairment.
714603_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Development costs for software that will be sold or licensed to third parties, prior to the achievement of technological feasibility, are expensed as incurred.
714603_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	We capitalize software development costs for software that will be sold or licensed to third parties which are incurred after the products reach technological feasibility but prior to the general release of the product to customers.
714603_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	These capitalized development costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis using the greater of the amount computed by taking the ratio of current year s gross revenues to current and anticipated future gross revenues or the amount computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the product, which is generally three to five years.
714603_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	We evaluate the net realizable value of capitalized software development costs on a product-by-product basis.
714603_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets We have recorded goodwill and intangible assets in connection with various acquisitions of businesses.
714603_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Intangible assets at December 31, 2014 and 2013 primarily represent customer relationships and other definite lived intangible assets (trade names, non-compete agreements, etc.) acquired.
714603_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	The estimated useful life on these intangible assets ranges from 5 to 17 years.
714603_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	The weighted average amortization period at December 31, 2014 for customer relationships and other intangible assets is 14.2 and 8.9 years, respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	We assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and assess identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
714603_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	Intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.
714603_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Our assessment of goodwill for impairment includes comparing the fair value to the net book value of our reporting units.
714603_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	Our 2014 and 2013 annual goodwill impairment tests determined that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units.
714603_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	During 2012, the goodwill held at the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit was impaired as further described in Note 9 of these financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P44_S3	The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows.
714603_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	Income taxes We recognize the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.
714603_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	Deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the liability method.
714603_15_ITEM8_P45_S2	This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and differences between the income tax and financial accounting statement bases of assets and liabilities and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment.
714603_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	The income statement effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes on the balance sheet.
714603_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	From time to time, we enter into transactions for which the tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code or applicable state tax laws is uncertain.
714603_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	We provide federal and/or state income taxes on such transactions, together with related interest, net of income tax benefit, and any applicable penalties in accordance with accounting guidance for income tax uncertainties.
714603_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	We record income tax uncertainties that are estimated to take more than 12 months to resolve as non-current.
714603_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are recorded in income tax expense.
714603_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	Foreign currency translation Our international subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency.
714603_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	We translate our assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates.
714603_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	Income and expense accounts are translated at average rates during the period.
714603_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	Diluted earnings per share are determined by including the dilutive effect of all potential common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_15_ITEM8_P50_S2	See Note 13 for additional details regarding our earnings per share computation.
714603_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	Derivative and hedging activities We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value and the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
714603_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	From time to time, we utilize derivatives to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
714603_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	We do not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes.
714603_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had derivative instruments outstanding which are described in Note 11 of these financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	Comprehensive income Our comprehensive income consists of net income and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, our proportional share of unconsolidated affiliates other comprehensive income (limited by the carrying value of the investment), unrealized gains or losses on our cash flow hedges and foreign currency translation adjustments, which are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income net of tax, and reclassifications to earnings.
714603_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	Share-based compensation We have share-based compensation plans covering our employees and our non-employee directors and have outstanding share awards (primarily in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units) under each of these plans.
714603_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	We recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards offset by estimates of compensation costs related to awards that are not expected to vest.
714603_15_ITEM8_P54_S2	For share-based awards granted, we expense the grant date fair value of these awards using the straight-line method over the service period.
714603_15_ITEM8_P54_S3	Amortization for the grant date fair value of share-based awards containing both service and performance features depends on our judgments on whether the performance conditions will be achieved.
714603_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	Out-of-period adjustment During 2014, in connection with the preparation of the Federal tax return for the year ended December 31, 2013, we determined that a portion of the deferred tax liability associated with the interest deduction on the convertible debentures, which were redeemed during 2013, should have been recorded as additional paid-in capital rather than a current liability within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013.
714603_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	To correct the error, the reclassification of $11.6 million from other current liabilities to additional paid-in capital has been reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014.
714603_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	Based on our evaluation of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors related to this adjustment, we concluded that the adjustment was not material to either the December 31, 2014 or 2013 Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_15_ITEM8_P55_S3	The adjustment had no impact on income, expenses or cash flows.
714603_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standard update, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.
714603_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	The new consolidation guidance changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE.
714603_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	It also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities.
714603_15_ITEM8_P56_S3	The guidance is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
714603_15_ITEM8_P56_S4	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
714603_15_ITEM8_P56_S5	We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
714603_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	This standard will replace the existing accounting standard for revenue recognition and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
714603_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	Early application of this standard is not permitted.
714603_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	This standard permits two transition approaches, either the retrospective transition method or the cumulative effect transition method.
714603_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	We are currently evaluating the standard, including which transition approach will be applied and the impact it will have on the consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.
714603_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	This standard changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations and modifies the disclosure requirements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	This standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods after December 15, 2014.
714603_15_ITEM8_P59_S3	Early adoption of the standard is permitted for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued.
714603_15_ITEM8_P59_S4	We elected to early adopt this standard beginning in the third quarter 2014.
714603_15_ITEM8_P59_S5	The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
714603_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	This standard requires netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions.
714603_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	This standard was effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
714603_15_ITEM8_P60_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity.
714603_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	This standard requires the release of any cumulative translation adjustment into net income only upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of a controlling interest in a subsidiary or a group of assets within a foreign entity.
714603_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	Also, it requires the release of all or a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment to net income in the case of a sale of an equity-method investment that is a foreign entity.
714603_15_ITEM8_P61_S3	This standard was effective prospectively beginning January 1, 2014.
714603_15_ITEM8_P61_S4	The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	Significant Business Transactions and Events Sale of Business As part of our ongoing strategy evaluation, it was determined that DST Global Solutions Ltd. ( Global Solutions ), a wholly-owned subsidiary which provides investment management software applications, implementation and other professional services, was no longer a key component of DST s long-term strategic plan.
714603_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	This change in strategy will not have a major effect on our operations or financial results.
714603_15_ITEM8_P62_S2	On November 30, 2014, we sold Global Solutions for cash consideration of $95.0 million , subject to customary working capital post-closing adjustments.
714603_15_ITEM8_P62_S3	Of the $95.0 million in proceeds received, $9.5 million is restricted for a period of eighteen months from the transaction, for purposes of payment of potential obligations that may arise based upon the terms and conditions of the sale agreement.
714603_15_ITEM8_P62_S4	The remaining proceeds received from the sale will be utilized in our overall capital plan.
714603_15_ITEM8_P62_S5	Operating revenue generated from the Global Solutions businesses sold was approximately $61.4 million , $71.3 million and $76.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

714603_15_ITEM8_P62_S7	We recorded a pretax gain of $100.5 million on the sale of the business during 2014.
714603_15_ITEM8_P62_S8	Our pretax gain exceeded our sale proceeds primarily from the reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments due to the substantial liquidation of certain foreign entities, partially offset by transaction costs.
714603_15_ITEM8_P62_S9	The carrying value of the entities sold was minimal.
714603_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	Restructuring Initiative As a result of market changes which have impacted our service offerings to clients, including lower registered account processing, during 2014 we implemented a restructuring initiative to reduce our workforce and consolidate certain facilities to enhance operational efficiency within the Financial Services and Customer Communications segments.

714603_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	Fair Value Measurements Authoritative accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
714603_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
714603_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we held certain investment assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
714603_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	These investment assets include money market funds, available-for-sale equity securities and trading securities whereby fair value is determined using quoted prices in active markets.
714603_15_ITEM8_P80_S2	Accordingly, the fair value measurements of these investments have been classified as Level 1 in the table below.
714603_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	Fair value for deferred compensation liabilities that are credited with deemed gains or losses of the underlying hypothetical investments, primarily equity securities, has been classified as Level 1 in the tables below.
714603_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	In addition, we have investments in available-for-sale fixed income securities, pooled funds and interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments that are required to be reported at fair value.
714603_15_ITEM8_P81_S2	Fair value for the available-for-sale fixed income securities and derivative instruments was determined using inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are directly or indirectly observable.
714603_15_ITEM8_P81_S3	Fair value for investments in pooled funds is determined using net asset value.
714603_15_ITEM8_P81_S4	Accordingly, our investments in available-for-sale fixed income securities, pooled funds and derivative instruments have been classified as Level 2 in the tables below.
714603_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	The following tables present assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):

714603_15_ITEM8_P83_S4	The unconsolidated affiliate used inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are directly or indirectly observable relating to the measurement of the interest rate swap.
714603_15_ITEM8_P83_S5	The fair value measurement of the interest rate swap has been classified as Level 2 by the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_15_ITEM8_P83_S6	The above table presents only assets and liabilities measured at fair value for which we control, and accordingly excludes items held by unconsolidated affiliates.
714603_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment and related accumulated depreciation are as follows (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	At both December 31, 2014 and 2013 , there was approximately $11.8 million of assets under capital lease, net of accumulated depreciation of $9.2 million and $7.6 million , respectively, included in the above table.

714603_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	The following tables summarize the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , by segment (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 and at other times if a significant change in circumstances indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced.
714603_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	The valuation of goodwill requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows, market multiples and discount rates.
714603_15_ITEM8_P93_S1	Our 2014 annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units.
714603_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	In connection with the sale of Global Solutions on November 30, 2014, $7.4 million of the goodwill within the Financial Services segment was allocated to the business sold and therefore removed along with the other net assets of the business sold.
714603_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	Based upon these revised future cash flow projections, the 2012 goodwill impairment test indicated that the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value.
714603_15_ITEM8_P95_S1	Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $60.8 million in the Customer Communications Segment during 2012.
714603_15_ITEM8_P95_S2	No tax benefit was recognized for this impairment charge.
714603_15_ITEM8_P95_S3	The remaining goodwill in the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $6.5 million and $7.6 million , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	Debt The Company is obligated under notes and other indebtedness as follows (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	Accounts receivable securitization program We securitize certain of our domestic accounts receivable through an accounts receivable securitization program with a third-party bank.
714603_15_ITEM8_P97_S1	The maximum amount that can be outstanding under this program is $150.0 million .
714603_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	In May 2014, we renewed our accounts receivable securitization program.
714603_15_ITEM8_P98_S1	The facility matures on May 14, 2015, unless renewed.
714603_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	Under the terms of the accounts receivable securitization program, (a) we periodically acquire accounts receivable originated by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, DST Output, DST Health Solutions, DST Technologies and Argus Health Systems (the Subsidiary Originators ), (b) we transfer receivables originated by us and receivables acquired from the Subsidiary Originators, on a periodic basis, to a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of DST (the SPE ), and (c) the SPE then sells undivided interests in the receivables to the bank.
714603_15_ITEM8_P99_S1	We retain servicing responsibility over the receivables.
714603_15_ITEM8_P99_S2	The program contains customary restrictive covenants as well as customary events of default.
714603_15_ITEM8_P99_S3	We have continuing involvement with the transferred assets because we maintain servicing responsibilities for the accounts receivable assets included in the accounts receivable securitization program.
714603_15_ITEM8_P99_S4	Accounts receivable assets transferred from us to our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary contain restrictions because they are not available to satisfy the creditors of any other person, including DST or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates.
714603_15_ITEM8_P99_S5	Further, neither we nor the SPE guarantees collectibility of the receivables or the creditworthiness of obligors.
714603_15_ITEM8_P99_S6	The SPE retains an interest in the receivables in excess of the amount transferred to the conduit, and such receivables will continue to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_15_ITEM8_P99_S7	The carrying value of the retained interest approximates its estimated fair value at the balance sheet date.
714603_15_ITEM8_P99_S8	We believe increases in the level of assumed interest rates and/or credit losses compared to assumptions in effect at the balance sheet date by 10% or 20% would not materially affect the fair value of the retained interest at the reporting date.
714603_15_ITEM8_P99_S9	The outstanding amount under the program was $120.0 million and $150.0 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

714603_15_ITEM8_P99_S12	The impact on net income stemming from these transfers was not material.
714603_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	Costs associated with the accounts receivable securitization program are included in interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	The program costs applicable to the outstanding amount of undivided interests in the receivables are generally based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
714603_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	Term loan credit facility On October 28, 2011, we entered into a $125.0 million unsecured term loan credit facility with a bank.

714603_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	Revolving credit facilities On October 1, 2014, we entered into a new syndicated revolving line of credit facility that replaced our previous $630.0 million facility which had a maturity date of July 1, 2015.

714603_15_ITEM8_P103_S2	The interest rates applicable to loans under the new credit agreement are generally based on Eurodollar, Federal Funds or prime rates plus applicable margins as defined in the agreement.
714603_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	The syndicated revolving line of credit facility contains grid schedules that adjust borrowing costs up or down based upon our consolidated leverage ratio.
714603_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	The grid schedules may result in fluctuations in borrowing costs ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% over Eurodollar and 0.00% to 0.70% over base rate , as defined.
714603_15_ITEM8_P104_S2	Additionally, an annual facility fee of 0.125% to 0.30% is required on this syndicated revolving line of credit.
714603_15_ITEM8_P104_S3	Among other provisions, the credit agreement requires certain leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	If any event of default occurs and is continuing, all amounts payable under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable.
714603_15_ITEM8_P105_S1	The maturity date for the new syndicated revolving line of credit facility is October 1, 2019.
714603_15_ITEM8_P105_S2	Amounts borrowed on the syndicated revolving line of credit facilities were $44.3 million and $10.4 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

714603_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	The Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants, as well as certain customary events of default, including cross-default provisions.
714603_15_ITEM8_P110_S1	Among other provisions, the Agreement limits our ability to incur or create liens, sell assets, issue priority indebtedness and change lines of business.
714603_15_ITEM8_P110_S2	The agreement also requires certain leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	Related party credit agreements We acquired certain intangible assets in 2011 from BFDS in exchange for an installment loan that is payable over five years and matures in September 2016.
714603_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	The amounts outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $3.7 million and $5.8 million , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	Other indebtedness We have other indebtedness of $14.9 million and $21.8 million outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, which is primarily comprised of debt assumed in a 2006 business acquisition and a secured promissory note payable.
714603_15_ITEM8_P112_S1	The debt assumed had outstanding balances at December 31, 2014 and 2013 of $7.0 million and $10.4 million , respectively, and is payable in monthly installments with a fixed interest rate of 5.6% .
714603_15_ITEM8_P112_S2	The maturity date of this indebtedness is October 2016.
714603_15_ITEM8_P112_S3	The secured promissory note payable is secured by real estate in Bristol U.K., is denominated in British Pounds, requires quarterly principal payments and matures in July 2018.

714603_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	Based upon the borrowing rates currently available to us for indebtedness with similar terms and average maturities, the carrying value of long-term debt, with the exception of the Senior Notes, is considered to approximate fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
714603_15_ITEM8_P113_S2	The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes was derived principally from quoted prices (level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).
714603_15_ITEM8_P113_S3	The carrying and fair value of the Senior Notes were as follows (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions.
714603_15_ITEM8_P114_S1	When determined appropriate, we use derivative instruments as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks.
714603_15_ITEM8_P114_S2	The primary market risks managed by us through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk.
714603_15_ITEM8_P114_S3	We may use various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts, option contracts and swaps.
714603_15_ITEM8_P114_S4	We do not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes.
714603_15_ITEM8_P114_S5	We determine the fair values of our derivatives based on quoted market prices that are directly or indirectly observable as further described within Note 7 of these financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P114_S6	The fair value of our derivative instruments is reflected on a gross, rather than net, basis.
714603_15_ITEM8_P114_S7	The following table presents the fair values of our derivative instruments that were designated and qualified as part of a hedging relationship (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	Cash flow hedging strategy We use cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.
714603_15_ITEM8_P115_S1	The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) and are reclassified into the line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.
714603_15_ITEM8_P115_S2	The changes in fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings.
714603_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	The maximum length of time for which we hedge our exposure to future cash flows is typically one to two years.
714603_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	We have entered into a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our net cash outflows from intercompany purchases of services from our international subsidiaries could be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
714603_15_ITEM8_P117_S1	We entered into forward foreign currency contracts (Thai baht) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies.
714603_15_ITEM8_P117_S2	The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for our foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $14.0 million and $11.2 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	We monitor the mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly.
714603_15_ITEM8_P118_S1	From time to time, we manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments.
714603_15_ITEM8_P118_S2	We have entered into interest rate swap agreements and have designated these instruments as part of our interest rate cash flow hedging program.
714603_15_ITEM8_P118_S3	The objective of this hedging program is to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in benchmark interest rates on our future interest payments.
714603_15_ITEM8_P118_S4	The total notional values of these interest rate swap agreements that were designated and qualified for our interest rate cash flow hedging program were $6.1 million and $7.3 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	The following table presents the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on AOCI and earnings during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	There were no gains or losses recognized into income as a result of hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
714603_15_ITEM8_P120_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , we estimate that amounts to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months are $0.2 million .
714603_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	In addition to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, we also use certain derivatives as economic hedges of foreign currency exposure.
714603_15_ITEM8_P121_S1	Although these derivatives were not designated for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges.
714603_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	The changes in fair values of economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.
714603_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	We use foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on certain intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies (British pound and Canadian dollar).
714603_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	The foreign currency economic hedging program consists of rolling, monthly forward foreign currency contracts which settle on the last day of each month.
714603_15_ITEM8_P124_S1	As a result, there are minimal unrealized gains or losses at the end of the period related to these contracts.
714603_15_ITEM8_P124_S2	The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency economic hedges were $85.1 million and $115.1 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse.
714603_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	Deferred tax expense (benefit) is generally the result of changes in the assets or liabilities for deferred taxes.
714603_15_ITEM8_P126_S1	The following summarizes pretax income (loss) (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	Provision for income taxes (benefits) consists of the following components (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P128_S0	Following are the reconciliations of our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal income tax statutory rate (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	The federal and state deferred tax assets (liabilities) recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	We have approximately $41.2 million of state net operating losses as of December 31, 2014 .
714603_15_ITEM8_P130_S1	These net operating losses begin to expire in 2023.
714603_15_ITEM8_P130_S2	We have approximately $12.6 million and $19.2 million of net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2014 in Canada and the U.K., respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P130_S3	The Canada carryforwards begin to expire in 2028.
714603_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	The U.K. carryforwards do not expire but their utilization may be limited to offset only income with certain characteristics.
714603_15_ITEM8_P132_S0	A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
714603_15_ITEM8_P132_S1	In evaluating the realizability of certain international net deferred tax assets, we also anticipate that limitations may result in the benefit of these amounts not being realized and have established corresponding valuation allowances as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 of $20.8 million and $27.1 million , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	We provide deferred taxes for unremitted earnings of U.S. unconsolidated affiliates net of the 80% dividends received deduction provided for under current tax law.
714603_15_ITEM8_P133_S1	Through December 31, 2014 , the cumulative amount of such unremitted earnings was $78.2 million .
714603_15_ITEM8_P133_S2	These amounts would become taxable to us if distributed by the affiliates as dividends, in which case we would be entitled to the dividends received deduction for 80% of the dividends; alternatively, these earnings could be realized by the sale of the affiliates stock, which would give rise to tax at federal capital gains rates and state ordinary income tax rates, to the extent the stock sale proceeds exceeded our tax basis.
714603_15_ITEM8_P133_S3	Deferred taxes provided on unremitted earnings through December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $5.6 million and $5.9 million , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	We record U.S. tax on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.
714603_15_ITEM8_P134_S1	During fourth quarter 2013, we assessed the forecasted cash needs and the overall financial position of our foreign subsidiaries and determined that a portion of previously permanently reinvested earnings would no longer be reinvested overseas.
714603_15_ITEM8_P134_S2	As a result, during 2013 we made distributions from and/or reversed our permanently reinvested assertions with respect to our Thailand, Mauritius and South Africa subsidiaries, as well as issued a one-time dividend from one of our Canadian subsidiaries.
714603_15_ITEM8_P134_S3	These 2013 distributions resulted in incremental U.S. tax of $7.5 million .
714603_15_ITEM8_P134_S4	We recorded approximately $2.5 million and $1.0 million of related income tax liability, net of credits, on unremitted earnings in 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P134_S5	We intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings in the businesses of our other foreign subsidiaries.
714603_15_ITEM8_P134_S6	As a consequence, no federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided for amounts which would become payable, if any, on the distribution of such earnings.
714603_15_ITEM8_P134_S7	In the event of such a distribution, we may be able to offset, at least in part, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such a distribution with foreign income tax credits which would become creditable as a result of such a distribution.
714603_15_ITEM8_P134_S8	It is not practicable for us to determine the income tax we would incur, if any, if such earnings were distributed.
714603_15_ITEM8_P134_S9	As of December 31, 2014 , accumulated undistributed earnings considered permanently reinvested were $41.1 million .
714603_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	Included in the net unrecognized tax benefit at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were $51.8 million , $74.7 million and $63.0 million , respectively, of tax positions which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
714603_15_ITEM8_P136_S1	We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes, which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods.
714603_15_ITEM8_P136_S2	The liability for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits decreased $7.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $9.4 million .
714603_15_ITEM8_P136_S3	The liability for interest and penalties increased $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 .
714603_15_ITEM8_P136_S4	Although it is difficult to predict when all uncertain tax positions will reverse due to the unknown timing of the completion of examination periods, it is possible that aggregate income tax amounts up to approximately $8.0 million may reverse during 2015.
714603_15_ITEM8_P137_S0	We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
714603_15_ITEM8_P137_S1	An Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) examination for the tax years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009 was completed in April 2013.
714603_15_ITEM8_P137_S2	Federal tax years 2010 through 2014 are subject to examination while various years from 1999 through 2014 are under or are subject to various state, local, and foreign income tax examinations by taxing authorities.
714603_15_ITEM8_P138_S0	We do not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on our financial statements.
714603_15_ITEM8_P138_S1	We filed federal income tax refund claims for research and experimentation credits for the tax years 2002 through 2009.
714603_15_ITEM8_P138_S2	During 2012, we reached a resolution with the IRS in regards to 2002 through 2005 refund claims.
714603_15_ITEM8_P138_S3	As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $16.0 million .
714603_15_ITEM8_P138_S4	This income tax benefit relates to the resolved claim years and certain post-audit periods that are still subject to examination.
714603_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	We filed federal income tax refund claims for the tax years 2005 through 2009 related to our Domestic Manufacturing Deduction under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 based on technical developments and interpretations that have occurred since filing the original returns.
714603_15_ITEM8_P139_S1	During 2012, we reached a resolution with the IRS in regards to the 2005 refund claim.
714603_15_ITEM8_P139_S2	As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $2.3 million .
714603_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	During 2013, the IRS completed its examination of the previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions and research and experimentation credits for the periods 2006 through 2009.
714603_15_ITEM8_P140_S1	As a result, during 2013 we recognized income tax benefits of $16.1 million , resulting from the reversal of previously reserved tax positions related to these matters.
714603_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	The income tax benefit for the research and experimentation credits relates to the resolved claim years and certain post-audit periods that are still subject to examination.
714603_15_ITEM8_P141_S1	The income tax benefit for the Domestic Manufacturing Deductions relates only to the resolved claim years.
714603_15_ITEM8_P142_S0	Equity Preferred stock We have authorized 10.0 million shares of preferred stock, of which no shares are currently issued or outstanding.
714603_15_ITEM8_P142_S1	However, 0.1 million shares of preferred stock have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the Company s rights agreement, the terms of which, in certain circumstances, would entitle the holders of our common stock to which the rights are attached to purchase 1/1000ths of a share of Series A Preferred Stock (or in some cases, shares of our common stock, other securities, cash or other assets) at a purchase price of $225 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
714603_15_ITEM8_P143_S0	Earnings per share The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):
714603_15_ITEM8_P144_S0	We had approximately 37.6 million and 41.8 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P144_S1	There were no shares from options to purchase common stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
714603_15_ITEM8_P144_S2	We had $90.1 million of convertible debentures outstanding at December 31, 2012, which were redeemed during 2013.
714603_15_ITEM8_P144_S3	The convertible debentures would have had a potentially dilutive effect on our stock if converted into stock.
714603_15_ITEM8_P144_S4	The calculation of diluted earnings per share included an incremental amount of shares assumed to be issued for the conversion spread when the Company s average daily stock price exceeded the average accreted bond price per share.
714603_15_ITEM8_P144_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the dilutive effect of the convertible debentures was 0.2 million and 0.1 million shares.
714603_15_ITEM8_P144_S6	Since we settled the principal and conversion spread on the convertible debentures with cash, the redemption did not result in a dilutive effect on earnings per share.
714603_15_ITEM8_P145_S0	Accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) balances, net of tax consist of the following (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P146_S0	Additions to and reclassifications out of AOCI attributable to the Company (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P147_S0	(1) Realized (gains)/losses on available for sale securities are recognized in Other income, net.
714603_15_ITEM8_P147_S1	(2) Reclassification to net earnings of derivatives qualifying as effective foreign currency cash flow hedges are recognized in Costs and expenses.
714603_15_ITEM8_P147_S2	(3) Reclassification to net earnings of derivatives qualifying as effective interest rate cash flow hedges are recognized in Interest expense.
714603_15_ITEM8_P147_S3	(4) Reclassification upon liquidation of foreign entities are recognized in Gain on sale of business.
714603_15_ITEM8_P147_S4	One of our unconsolidated affiliates had an interest rate swap liability with a fair market value of $50.2 million , $45.5 million and $73.5 million at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P147_S5	Our 50% proportionate share of this interest rate swap liability was $25.1 million , $22.8 million and $36.8 million at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P147_S6	We record in investments and AOCI our proportionate share of this liability in an amount not to exceed the carrying value of our investment in this unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_15_ITEM8_P147_S7	Because the carrying value of this unconsolidated affiliate investment balance was zero at both December 31, 2014 and 2013 , no interest rate swap liability or change in AOCI was recorded.
714603_15_ITEM8_P148_S0	Stock repurchases and retirements On January 29, 2014, the Board of Directors of DST authorized a $250.0 million share repurchase plan.
714603_15_ITEM8_P148_S1	We repurchased 2.2 million shares of DST common stock for $200.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting in approximately $50.0 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan.
714603_15_ITEM8_P148_S2	During January 2015, we spent $50.0 million to repurchase 0.5 million shares which completed the existing share repurchase plan.
714603_15_ITEM8_P148_S3	Under previous share repurchase plans, we expended $252.6 million for approximately 3.4 million shares and $73.7 million for approximately 1.3 million shares during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P148_S4	On January 28, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new $250.0 million share repurchase plan, which allows, but does not require, the repurchase of common stock in open market and private transactions.
714603_15_ITEM8_P149_S0	As of March 23, 2014, the Argyros Group beneficially owned 9.2 million shares or approximately 22% of DST common shares.
714603_15_ITEM8_P149_S1	During March 2014, we entered into an agreement under which we agreed to a two-step process to assist Argyros with the disposition of a substantial portion of their common stock ownership in DST.
714603_15_ITEM8_P149_S2	To implement Argyros disposition, we facilitated the May 2014 registered, secondary common stock offering of $450.0 million (before any overallotment option) of DST common stock beneficially owned by Argyros.
714603_15_ITEM8_P149_S3	Concurrent with the closing of the secondary offering and based upon a price determined in the secondary offering, we repurchased, and simultaneously retired, 2.4 million shares of our common stock from Argyros for $200.0 million .
714603_15_ITEM8_P149_S4	In connection with this share repurchase, we recorded a non-cash gain of $18.1 million during 2014 resulting from the change in stock price between the date the share repurchase price became fixed and the settlement date.

714603_15_ITEM8_P151_S2	We had 12.4 million and 53.5 million shares of common stock held in treasury at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P151_S3	In 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , we paid cash dividends per common share of $1.20 , $1.20 , and $0.80 , respectively.

714603_15_ITEM8_P152_S0	Share-based compensation The DST Systems, Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the Employee Plan ) and the DST Systems, Inc. 2005 Non-Employee Directors Award Plan (the Directors Plan ) became effective on May 10, 2005.
714603_15_ITEM8_P152_S1	The term of both the Employee Plan and the Directors Plan is from May 10, 2005 through May 9, 2015.
714603_15_ITEM8_P152_S2	We have outstanding share awards (primarily in the form of stock options and restricted stock) under each of these plans.
714603_15_ITEM8_P152_S3	Both of these share-based compensation plans have been approved by our Board of Directors and shareholders.
714603_15_ITEM8_P153_S0	The Employee Plan amends, restates and renames the DST Systems, Inc. 1995 Stock Option and Performance Award Plan ( 1995 Plan ).
714603_15_ITEM8_P153_S1	The number of shares of common stock reserved for delivery under the Employee Plan is the sum of (a) 4.0 million shares, plus (b) the number of shares remaining under the 1995 Plan (originally 30 million shares available) as of May 10, 2005 (not subject to outstanding Awards under the 1995 Plan and not delivered out of the shares reserved thereunder), plus (c) shares that become available under the 1995 Plan after May 10, 2005 pursuant to forfeiture, termination, lapse or satisfaction of an award in cash or property other than shares of common stock, application as payment for an award, or, except with respect to restricted stock, to satisfy tax withholding, plus (d) any shares of common stock required to satisfy substitute awards.
714603_15_ITEM8_P153_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , approximately 5.6 million shares were available under the Employee Plan.
714603_15_ITEM8_P154_S0	The Employee Plan provides for the availability of shares of our common stock for the grant of awards to employees, prospective employees and consultants to the Company or an affiliate.
714603_15_ITEM8_P154_S1	Awards under the Employee Plan may take the form of shares, dividend equivalents, options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock, annual incentive awards, service awards and substitute awards (each as defined in the plan).
714603_15_ITEM8_P155_S0	The Directors Plan replaced the component of the 1995 Plan that provided for equity awards to directors who are not employees of DST or any affiliate.
714603_15_ITEM8_P155_S1	Subject to adjustment, as provided in the Directors Plan, the number of shares of common stock reserved for delivery under this plan is the sum of (a) 300,000 shares plus (b) any shares of common stock required to satisfy substitute awards, as defined in the Directors Plan.

714603_15_ITEM8_P156_S2	Options vest and generally become fully exercisable over three years of continued employment, depending upon the grant type.
714603_15_ITEM8_P157_S0	The Black-Scholes option valuation model was used in estimating the fair value of options granted.
714603_15_ITEM8_P157_S1	Option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility.
714603_15_ITEM8_P158_S0	We estimate expected stock price volatility via observations of the historical (generally the last three years) volatility trends.
714603_15_ITEM8_P159_S0	contractual term of each option granted.
714603_15_ITEM8_P159_S1	The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Government zero-coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option as of the option grant date.
714603_15_ITEM8_P160_S0	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
714603_15_ITEM8_P160_S1	There were no option grants made during 2014 or 2013.
714603_15_ITEM8_P160_S2	The following table provides the ranges of assumptions and weighted-average assumptions used for grants made under the option plans during 2012 , as well as the range of fair values and weighted-average fair value of options granted.
714603_15_ITEM8_P161_S0	Summary stock option activity is presented in the table below (shares in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P162_S0	The total aggregate intrinsic values of options exercised for all plans during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were $13.1 million , $20.7 million and $32.9 million , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P163_S0	Grants of restricted stock may consist of restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) or restricted stock units ( RSUs ).
714603_15_ITEM8_P163_S1	Grants of restricted stock are valued at the date of grant based on the value of DST s common stock and are expensed using the straight-line method over the service period or, in the case of performance based vesting awards, over the expected period to achieve the required performance criteria.
714603_15_ITEM8_P163_S2	Except for restrictions placed on the transferability of the restricted stock, holders of RSAs have full stockholders rights during the term of restriction, including voting rights and the right to receive cash dividends, if any.
714603_15_ITEM8_P163_S3	Grants of RSUs do not confer full stockholder rights such as voting rights and cash dividends, but provide for additional dividend equivalent RSU awards in lieu of cash dividends.
714603_15_ITEM8_P164_S0	termination of employment with the Company depending on the circumstances of the termination, or failure to achieve the required performance condition.
714603_15_ITEM8_P165_S0	Included in the non-vested shares of outstanding RSUs at December 31, 2014 are approximately 0.4 million of RSUs that contain service features.
714603_15_ITEM8_P165_S1	In addition, the non-vested shares of RSUs at December 31, 2014 contain 0.3 million of performance stock units ( PSUs ).
714603_15_ITEM8_P165_S2	Management judgment is required to estimate amortization expense during the service period associated with both PSUs and RSUs containing performance features.
714603_15_ITEM8_P165_S3	We will continue to monitor and evaluate our assumptions for our performance-based awards and PSUs over the applicable performance periods for these awards.
714603_15_ITEM8_P166_S0	Summary restricted stock activity is presented in the table below (shares in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P167_S0	The fair values of RSAs and RSUs which vested during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $9.7 million , $31.5 million and $11.5 million , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P167_S1	The Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 reflects share-based compensation costs of $21.0 million , $16.9 million and $25.5 million , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P167_S2	The total tax benefits recognized in earnings from share-based compensation arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , were approximately $8.2 million , $6.6 million and $9.9 million , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P167_S3	Excess tax benefits of $6.1 million , $11.4 million and $5.5 million were classified as financing cash inflows during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P167_S4	Cash proceeds from options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were $13.0 million , $30.6 million and $61.9 million , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P168_S0	We generally issue shares out of treasury to satisfy stock option exercises.
714603_15_ITEM8_P168_S1	At December 31, 2014 , we had $29.9 million of total unrecognized compensation expense (included in Additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) related to our share-based compensation arrangements, net of estimated forfeitures.
714603_15_ITEM8_P168_S2	We estimate that the amortized compensation expense attributable to the stock option and restricted stock grants will be approximately $16.2 million for 2015 , $8.9 million for 2016 , and $1.7 million in 2017, based on awards currently outstanding.
714603_15_ITEM8_P168_S3	Future amortization is not projected on approximately $3.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense as the related awards are not currently expected to achieve their required performance features and therefore are not expected to vest.
714603_15_ITEM8_P169_S0	Stock purchase plans The 2000 DST Systems, Inc.
714603_15_ITEM8_P169_S1	Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ), which provided employees the right to purchase Company shares at a discount, was suspended effective January 1, 2006.
714603_15_ITEM8_P170_S0	Rights plan We are party to a Stockholders Rights Agreement dated as of October 10, 2005, which was amended and restated on August 5, 2011 (the Rights Plan ).
714603_15_ITEM8_P170_S1	By its terms, the Rights Plan will expire on October 10, 2015.
714603_15_ITEM8_P171_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Rights Plan, each share of our outstanding common stock has received one Right (as defined in the Rights Plan).
714603_15_ITEM8_P171_S1	Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase 1/1000ths of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, or in some circumstances, shares of our Common Stock, other securities, cash or other assets, at a purchase price of $225 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
714603_15_ITEM8_P171_S2	In the event a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Plan), the Rights will entitle each holder of a Right to purchase, for the purchase price, that number of shares of common stock equivalent to the number of shares of common stock which at the time of the transaction would have a market value of twice the purchase price.
714603_15_ITEM8_P171_S3	Any Rights that are at any time beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Plan) will be null and void and nontransferable and any holder of any such Right will be unable to exercise or transfer any such Right.
714603_15_ITEM8_P171_S4	At any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, but before a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the common shares, the Board of Directors may elect to exchange each Right for consideration per Right consisting of one-half of the number of shares of common stock that would be issuable at such time on the exercise of one Right and without payment of the purchase price.
714603_15_ITEM8_P171_S5	Under certain circumstances, we may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price of $0.0025 per Right.
714603_15_ITEM8_P172_S0	The Rights, which are automatically attached to common stock, are not exercisable or transferable separately from shares of common stock until upon the earlier of (i) ten ( 10 ) business days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons, together with any person acting in concert therewith, has acquired beneficial ownership of fifteen percent ( 15% ) or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock (as defined in greater detail in the Rights Plan); or (ii) ten ( 10 ) business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Plan), unless the Board of Directors sets a later date in either event.
714603_15_ITEM8_P173_S0	The Rights Plan is intended to encourage a potential acquiring person to negotiate directly with the Board of Directors, but may have certain anti-takeover effects.
714603_15_ITEM8_P173_S1	The Rights Plan could significantly dilute the interests in the Company of an Acquiring Person.
714603_15_ITEM8_P173_S2	The Rights Plan may therefore have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of the Company. 14.
714603_15_ITEM8_P174_S0	Benefit Plans We sponsor defined contribution plans that cover domestic and non-domestic employees following the completion of an eligibility period.
714603_15_ITEM8_P174_S1	Employer contribution expenses under these plans totaled $44.4 million , $42.4 million and $41.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P175_S0	We have active and non-active non-qualified deferred compensation plans for senior management, certain highly compensated employees and directors.
714603_15_ITEM8_P175_S1	Certain of the active plans permit existing participants to defer a portion of their compensation until termination of their employment, at which time payment of amounts deferred is made in a lump sum or annual installments.
714603_15_ITEM8_P175_S2	Deferred amounts earn interest at a rate determined by the Board of Directors or are credited with deemed gains or losses of the underlying hypothetical investments.
714603_15_ITEM8_P175_S3	Amounts deferred under these plans were approximately $30.2 million and $51.8 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P176_S0	Changes in the liability are recorded as adjustments to compensation expense.
714603_15_ITEM8_P176_S1	The underlying investments, which are classified as trading securities, are recorded at fair market value with changes recorded as adjustments to other income, net.

714603_15_ITEM8_P179_S1	We also have letters of credit of $9.6 million and $8.3 million outstanding for December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_15_ITEM8_P179_S2	Letters of credit are secured by our debt facility.
714603_15_ITEM8_P179_S3	We have future obligations under certain operating leases.
714603_15_ITEM8_P179_S4	The operating leases, which include facilities, data processing and other equipment, have lease terms ranging from 1 to 14 years excluding options to extend the leases for various lengths of time.
714603_15_ITEM8_P179_S5	Certain leases have clauses that call for the annual rents to be increased during the term of the lease.
714603_15_ITEM8_P179_S6	Such lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis.
714603_15_ITEM8_P179_S7	We also lease certain facilities from unconsolidated real estate affiliates.
714603_15_ITEM8_P179_S8	The following rental costs were incurred (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P180_S0	Obligations under software license agreements generally relate to purchase obligations under maintenance agreements that support the software license.
714603_15_ITEM8_P181_S0	We have entered into agreements with certain officers whereby upon defined circumstances constituting a change in control of the Company, certain benefit entitlements are automatically funded and such officers are entitled to specific cash payments upon termination of employment.
714603_15_ITEM8_P181_S1	We have also established trusts to provide for the funding of corporate commitments and entitlements of Company officers, directors, employees and others in the event of a change in control of the Company.
714603_15_ITEM8_P181_S2	Assets held in such trusts at December 31, 2014 and 2013 and were not significant.
714603_15_ITEM8_P182_S0	We received a regulatory inquiry, in February 2012, regarding information that our pharmacy claims processing business prepared on behalf of its Medicare Part D Plan Sponsor customers that those Medicare Part D Plan Sponsor customers subsequently provided to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, during the period 2006 to 2009.
714603_15_ITEM8_P182_S1	That information related to amounts that were paid to Louisiana pharmacies that dispensed prescription drugs to Medicare Part D plan members.
714603_15_ITEM8_P182_S2	In August 2014, we resolved this matter with the regulator resulting in a payment of $2.0 million .
714603_15_ITEM8_P182_S3	In addition, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business.
714603_15_ITEM8_P182_S4	While the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, that the final outcome in such proceedings, in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
714603_15_ITEM8_P183_S0	Other contractual commitments In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products and other business assets, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters.
714603_15_ITEM8_P183_S1	We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties.
714603_15_ITEM8_P183_S2	These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.
714603_15_ITEM8_P183_S3	Except for a $2.1 million liability established in connection with the indemnification of certain matters associated with the sale of a business and an $0.8 million liability recorded associated with a performance guarantee on a franchise agreement, which were accrued at December 31, 2014, no liabilities have been established for guarantees or indemnifications as it is not possible to determine either the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements or the timing of any such payments due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
714603_15_ITEM8_P184_S0	Historically, payments made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
714603_15_ITEM8_P185_S0	Our operating business units offer sophisticated information processing and software services and products.
714603_15_ITEM8_P185_S1	We present these businesses as three operating segments, Financial Services, Healthcare Services and Customer Communications.
714603_15_ITEM8_P185_S2	Investments in the Company s equity securities, private equity investments, real estate and certain financial interests are included in the Investments and Other segment.
714603_15_ITEM8_P185_S3	The Customer Communications segment leases its California, Connecticut and Missouri production facilities from the Investments and Other segment, but we report financial results for the Customer Communications segment on the basis that the Customer Communications segment owns its production facilities.
714603_15_ITEM8_P185_S4	Management believes reporting Customer Communications on this basis improves its ability to analyze the Customer Communications segment operating results taking into consideration the special purpose nature of the production plants.
714603_15_ITEM8_P185_S5	The Investments and Other segment presents rental revenues from the Customer Communications segment along with the related depreciation expense associated with the properties, while the elimination of the inter-segment activity is included in the Elimination Adjustments.
714603_15_ITEM8_P186_S0	We evaluate the performance of our segments based on income before interest expense, income taxes, and non-controlling interest.
714603_15_ITEM8_P186_S1	Intersegment revenues are reflected at rates prescribed by us and may not be reflective of market rates.
714603_15_ITEM8_P187_S0	Summarized financial information concerning our segments is shown in the following tables (in millions):
714603_15_ITEM8_P188_S0	Earnings before interest and income taxes in the segment reporting information above less interest expense of $26.6 million , $34.5 million and $43.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, are equal to income before income taxes on a consolidated basis for the corresponding year.

714603_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter of the fiscal year for which this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
714603_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
714603_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

714603_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts, participants or transactions processed.
714603_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	For subaccounts, broker/dealers provide a portion of the services directly.
714603_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	As a result, our revenue per account is generally higher for registered accounts than for subaccounts.
714603_16_ITEM1_P7_S3	On a more limited basis, we also generate revenue through asset-based fee arrangements, subscriptions and/or seat licensing and from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in our full service transfer agency bank accounts.

714603_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Sources of new business for the Financial Services segment include: (i) existing clients, particularly with respect to complementary and new products and services, (ii) companies relying on their own in-house capabilities and not using outside vendors, (iii) companies using competitors systems, and (iv) new entrants into the markets served by Financial Services.
714603_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	We consider our existing client base to be one of our best sources of new business.
714603_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	We believe that competition in the markets in which the Financial Services segment operates is based largely on price, quality of service, features offered, the ability to handle rapidly changing volumes, response to compliance needs, product innovation, and responsiveness.
714603_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	Our competitors are primarily financial institutions and in-house systems.
714603_16_ITEM1_P8_S4	Our financial institution competitors may have an advantage because they can take into consideration the value of their clients funds on deposit or under management when pricing their services.
714603_16_ITEM1_P8_S5	We believe there is significant competition in our markets and our ability to compete effectively is dependent in part on access to capital.

714603_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Healthcare Services segment s five largest customers accounted for 48.7% of segment operating revenues in 2015 , including 18.4% from its largest customer.
714603_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	Effective January 2015, a significant client deconverted approximately 40% of its business with us.
714603_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	Subsequently, during mid-2015, we entered into a new multi-year contract with this existing client to provide administrative management of pharmacy claims for the client s commercial plan members.
714603_16_ITEM1_P10_S3	As a result of this agreement, the previously announced deconversion of this client s remaining members which was scheduled for 2015 and 2016 will not take place, and the client will remain on our pharmacy claims processing platform.

714603_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	We believe that we compete effectively in the market due to our ongoing investment in our products and the development of new products to meet the evolving business requirements of our customers.
714603_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our competitors healthcare administration and health outcomes optimization solutions are primarily based on complete replacement of a payer s core system.
714603_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe that a component application approach shifts the focus away from core application replacement to one in which clients have more alternatives for modernization of the business operation.
714603_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	With a component approach, health payer clients can still choose core application replacement if warranted, or adopt component applications that address only those areas of the business that offer the most opportunity of improvement for the customer, resulting in protection of the client s current IT investment and reduced disruption to its business operation.

714603_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Trends or events affecting our clients or their industries could decrease the demand for our products and services and the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our significant customers could materially harm our business and results of operations.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We derive our revenues from the delivery of products and services to clients in the mutual fund, brokerage, investment management, healthcare, telecommunications, other financial service (i.e. insurance, banking and financial planning) and other industries.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Demand for our products and services among companies in those industries could decline for many reasons.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If demand for our products decreases or any of the industries we serve decline or fail or consolidate, reducing the number of potential clients, our business and our operating results could be adversely affected.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	On a consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2015 , our five largest customers (excluding BFDS and IFDS, our 50%-owned joint ventures with State Street) accounted for approximately 18% of our consolidated operating revenues.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	For the same period, the Healthcare Services segment s five largest customers accounted for approximately 48.7% of our revenue in that segment, including 18.4% from its largest customer.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Because of our significant customer concentration, particularly in the Healthcare Services segment, our revenue could fluctuate significantly due to changes in economic conditions, the use of competitive products, or the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our significant customers, and a delay or default in payment by any significant customer could materially harm our business and results of operations.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Events that adversely affect our clients businesses, rates of growth or numbers of customers they serve could decrease demand for our products and services and the number of transactions we process.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Events that could adversely affect our clients businesses include decreased demand for our customers products and services, adverse conditions in our customers markets or adverse economic conditions generally.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P1_S8	We may be unsuccessful in predicting the needs of changing industries and whether potential customers will accept our products or services.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P1_S9	We also may invest in technology or infrastructure for specific customers and not realize additional revenue from such investments.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P1_S10	If trends or events do not occur as we expect, our business could be negatively impacted.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems could result in significant costs and reputational damage.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have developed and maintained, and our businesses depend on, information technology infrastructure, including elements both internal and external, to record and process a large volume of complex transactions and other data, including personally identifiable information regarding financial and health matters.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In certain circumstances, vendors have access to such data in order to assist us with responsibilities, such as producing benefit plan identification cards, maintaining software we license on our own behalf or resell to others, or helping clients comply with anti-money laundering regulations.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	A breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In recent years, several financial services firms were victims of computer systems hacking attacks, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data, and reputational harm.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Rapid advances in technology, and the limits and costs of technology, skills and manpower, may prevent us from anticipating, identifying, preventing or addressing all potential security threats and breaches.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Any interruptions, delays, breakdowns or breach, including as a result of cybersecurity breaches, of our, or of our vendors , information technology infrastructure, including improper employee actions, could result in the loss of confidential, personal or proprietary information.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues, regulatory penalties, and litigation.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We may be unable to attract and retain capable technical personnel for our processing businesses or quality executives to manage the complex structure of our business.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our success depends on recruiting and retaining adept management and personnel with expertise in software and systems development and the types of computer hardware and software we utilize.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel, our operations could be materially adversely affected.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Companies in our industry compete fiercely for qualified management and technical personnel.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately compete for or keep qualified personnel.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P5_S5	If we lack qualified management, there is an increased risk that we will adopt unfavorable business strategies, especially in a complex business like ours with multiple segments and operating entities.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If we lack qualified technical personnel, our ability to develop the systems and services our clients demand may also be negatively affected.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P5_S7	The demand for our products and services could decrease if we do not continually address our clients technology and capacity requirements.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our clients use technology-based products and services in the complex and rapidly changing markets in which they operate.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We must substantially invest in technology and systems to meet customer requirements for technology and capacity.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If we do not meet clients technology and capacity requirements in advance of our competitors or if the investments we make are not cost-effective or do not result in successful products or services, our business could be adversely affected.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited and our financial condition adversely affected.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Our business strategy anticipates that we will supplement internal growth by pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We may be unable to identify suitable businesses to acquire.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S6	We compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other complementary businesses.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Information we obtain about an acquisition target may be limited and there can be no assurance that an acquisition will perform as expected or positively impact our financial performance.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Potential acquisitions involve risk, including the risk we would be unable to effectively integrate the acquired technologies, operations and personnel into our business, and the risk that management s attention and our capital would be diverted from other areas of our business.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S9	The anticipated benefits of our acquisitions may not materialize.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S10	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the issuance of capital stock, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S11	If we cannot complete acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S12	If our new investments and business initiatives are not successful, our financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S13	We are investing heavily in our technology to improve existing products and services and add new products and services to address the needs of existing or new clients.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Our investments may not lead to successful deployment or increases in the number of accounts or transactions.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P6_S15	If we are not successful in creating value from our investments by increasing sales or reducing expenses, our financial condition and prospects could be harmed.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	An increase in subaccounting services performed by brokerage firms has and will continue to adversely impact our revenues.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We service mutual fund and other accounts under shareowner recordkeeping arrangements which we refer to as registered accounts.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These arrangements are distinguished from broker subaccounts, which are serviced under contract with a broker/dealer.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our clients may adopt the broker subaccount structure.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We offer subaccounting services to brokerage firms that perform shareowner subaccounting.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	As the recordkeeping functions in connection with subaccounting are more limited than traditional shareowner accounting, the fees charged are generally lower on a per unit basis.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Brokerage firms that obtain agreements from our clients to use a broker subaccount structure cause accounts currently on our traditional recordkeeping system to convert to our subaccounting system, or to the subaccounting systems of other service providers, which generally results in lower revenues.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S6	While subaccounting conversions have generally been limited to our non tax-advantaged mutual fund accounts, such conversions have begun to extend to the tax-advantaged accounts (such as retirement and Section 529 accounts) we service, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Consolidation in or among our customers and potential customers could result in a reduction of customers or reduction in use of our services.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Mergers or acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers or between our customers and other entities could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers and result in the discontinuation or reduction in use of our services.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S9	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S10	The adverse effects of consolidation could be greater in the financial services or healthcare services sectors.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S12	Our businesses are subject to substantial competition.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S13	We are subject to intense competition from other established service providers in all industries we serve.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S14	Some of our competitors are able to bundle service offerings and offer more appealing pricing structures.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S15	Some of our clients, or the clients they serve, may develop, have developed or are developing the in-house capacity to perform the transaction processing, recordkeeping and output services they have paid us to perform.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S16	Additionally, some of our competitors and clients have greater financial and human resources and access to capital than we do.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S17	In the financial and healthcare markets we serve, we compete based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the range of products offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, stability and continuity of client and other intermediary relationships, quality of service, and level of fees charged for services.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S18	We continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products and services offered.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S19	Our failure to successfully compete in any of our material operating businesses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S20	Competition could also affect the revenue mix of services we provide, resulting in decreased revenues in lines of business with higher profit margins.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P8_S21	The quality or availability of postal system services could decrease, reducing the volume of printed customer communications and negatively impacting our business.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are dependent on postal delivery systems for final delivery of printed customer communications.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Postal delivery systems are facing economic pressures from the reduction in First-Class mail and certain postal delivery systems have experienced work stoppages and other interruptions.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Accuracy and speed of delivery are important factors for clients using printed communications in their businesses.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Changes in the timeliness and quality of postal delivery could negatively impact the level of printed communications delivered by our customers to their clients.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	A decrease in such communications could adversely affect our business and our operating results.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Decreasing demand for traditional printed and mailed communications may continue to adversely affect our business, depending on the extent to which our customers and their clients acceptance of electronic alternatives continues to grow.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	To the extent our clients customers select electronic presentment and delivery of communications, the demand for our services for production and distribution of printed documents has decreased and could continue to decrease.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We provide electronic presentment and delivery solutions, but they are priced differently and require different capabilities than print-mail solutions.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Clients may choose to perform electronic hosting and distribution of communications to customers internally or select electronic solution providers other than us.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P10_S7	In particular, clients have terminated their services or moved production in-house.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P10_S8	This has and could continue to adversely affect our business and our operating results.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Damage to our facilities could impact our operations or financial condition.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The performance of our services also depends upon facilities that house central computer operations or operating centers or in which we process information, images, bills or statements.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Significant damage to any of our operating facilities could interrupt the operations at those facilities and interfere with our ability to serve customers.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We operate internationally and are thus exposed to currency fluctuations and foreign political, economic and other conditions that could adversely affect our revenues from or support by foreign operations.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Inherent risks in our international business activities could decrease our international sales and also could adversely affect our ability to receive important support from our international operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	These risks include potentially unfavorable foreign economic conditions, political conditions or national priorities, foreign government regulation, potential expropriation of assets by foreign governments, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, the failure to bridge cultural differences, and limited or prohibited access to our foreign operations and the support they provide.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We may also have difficulty repatriating any profits or be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in our international business.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Various events may cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The nature of these events might inhibit our ability to anticipate and act in advance to counter them.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We may be unsuccessful in determining or controlling when and whether events occur that could cause varying financial results.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Unfavorable results may occur that we did not anticipate or take advance action to address.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We incur significant costs to develop products used to service our existing and potential client operations.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P12_S5	The timing of these expenses may fluctuate as new client contracts are signed or existing client contracts are renewed, causing our results to vary accordingly.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Factors contributing to the variability of our results include increased costs of supplies, increased costs relating to existing and potential client operations, and hiring staff to develop new and existing products.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P12_S7	The timing of our fees associated with new and existing client contracts, including changes in recognition as a result of changes in accounting principles, may also cause results to vary from period to period.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P12_S8	Our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets, which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets, among other factors.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Over the past several years, the U.S. and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We could continue to be negatively impacted by the volatile markets as certain of our fees are tied to the asset bases of our clients.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The continuation or occurrence of significant market volatility or decreased levels of participation would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We also derive significant revenues from asset management and administration contracts with clients.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Under these contracts, the fees paid to us are based on a variety of factors, including the market value of assets under management (AUM), assets under administration (AUA) and number of transactions processed.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	AUM and AUA may decline for various reasons, causing results to vary.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Factors that could decrease AUM and AUA (and therefore revenues) include declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts managed and administered as well as redemptions and other withdrawals from, or shifts among, the funds and accounts managed and administered.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Investment decisions with respect to cash balances, market returns or losses on investments, and limits on insurance applicable to cash balances held in bank and brokerage accounts, including those held by us and as agent on behalf of our clients, could expose us to losses of such cash balances and adversely affect revenues attributable to cash balance deposit investments.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As part of our transaction processing and other services, we maintain and manage large bank and investment accounts containing client funds, which we hold as agent, as well as operational funds.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our revenues include investment earnings related to client fund cash balances.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our choices in selecting investments, or market conditions that affect the rate of return on or the availability of investments, could have an adverse effect on the level of such revenues.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The amounts held in our operational and client deposit accounts could exceed the limits of government insurance programs of organizations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation, exposing us to the risk of loss.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Any such loss would have an adverse impact on our business and our financial condition.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Operational errors in the performance of our services or contractual obligations could lead to liability for claims, client loss and result in reputational damage.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The failure to properly perform our services or contractual obligations could result in our clients and/or certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to losses including censures, fines, or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, such errors could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our revenues could decrease if client contracts are terminated or fail to renew or if clients renegotiate contracts or utilize our services at lower than anticipated levels.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We derive most of our revenue by selling products and services under long-term contracts, many of which contain terms and conditions based on anticipated levels of utilization of our services.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We cannot unilaterally extend the terms of our client contracts when they expire.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Contracts can terminate during the term of agreement for various reasons, including through termination for convenience clauses in some contracts that enable clients to cancel by written notice.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our revenues could decrease as a result of terminations or non-renewals of client contracts; extensions of client contracts under, or contract re-negotiations resulting in, less favorable terms; or utilization of services at less than anticipated levels.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We are substantially dependent on our intellectual property rights, and a claim for infringement or a requirement to indemnify a client for infringement could adversely affect us.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We have made substantial investments in software and other intellectual property on which our business is highly dependent.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the U.S. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S9	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S10	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S11	To the extent available, we rely on patent, trade secret and copyright laws; however, significant portions of our proprietary intellectual property is not protected by patents.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S12	We also utilize nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and security measures to protect our proprietary technology.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S13	We cannot guarantee these measures will be effective.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S14	Our products and services rely on technology developed by others, including open source software, and we have no control over possible infringement of someone else s intellectual property rights by the provider of this technology.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S15	The owner of the rights could seek damages from us rather than or in addition to the persons who provide the technology to us.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S16	We could be subject at any time to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to evaluate and defend.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S17	Our clients may also face infringement claims, allege that such claims relate to our products and services, and seek indemnification from us.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S18	Any loss of our intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights of others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S19	Our investments in funds and in other companies could decline in value.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S20	We hold significant investments in available-for-sale equity securities of other companies, primarily State Street Corporation, and other financial interests that are subject to fluctuations in market prices.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S21	A significant decline in the value of our equity investments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P19_S22	We may not always be able to sell those investments at higher prices than we paid for them or than the value of the consideration used to acquire them.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	From time to time we add new investment strategies to our investment product offerings by providing the initial cash investments as seed capital.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The seed capital investments may decline in value.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	A significant decline in their value could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are a limited partner in various private equity funds and have future capital commitments related to certain private equity fund investments.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Generally, private equity fund securities are non-transferable or are subject to long holding periods, and withdrawals from the private equity firm partnerships are typically not permitted.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Even when transfer restrictions do not apply, there is generally no public market for the securities.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Therefore, we may not be able to sell the securities at a time when we desire to do so.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We may not always be able to sell those investments at the same or higher prices than we paid for them.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We also participate in joint ventures with other companies.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P21_S6	These joint venture investments could require further capital contributions.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We have restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If we do not comply with these restrictive covenants, our failure could result in material and adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Our debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary investments, and asset dispositions, and require us to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in reduced liquidity for the Company and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our debt agreements could result in a cross default under one or more of our other debt agreements, including our financing agreements.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	This would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operation.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Regulatory and Litigation Risks We and our unconsolidated affiliates are subject to regulation.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Any regulatory violations, changes or uncertainties could adversely affect our business.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S8	A number of our businesses are subject to U.S. or foreign regulation, including privacy, licensing, processing, recordkeeping, investment adviser, broker/dealer, reporting and related regulations.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Such regulations cover all aspects of our businesses including, but not limited to, sales and trading methods, trade practices among broker/dealers, use and safekeeping of customers funds and securities, capital structure of securities firms, net capital, anti-money laundering efforts, record keeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Any violation of applicable regulations could expose us or those businesses to civil or criminal liability, significant fines or sanctions, damage our reputation, the revocation of licenses, censures, or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, which could adversely affect our business or our financial results.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S11	Governmental changes, changing interpretation of regulations, and uncertainties surrounding services we provide could increase our costs of business, result in penalties, or diminish business, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S12	The SEC, Department of Labor ( DOL ), or other regulatory agencies may issue regulations impacting third-party distributors of mutual funds, which could adversely affect our business.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S13	The SEC, DOL, or other regulatory agencies may issue regulations impacting third-party distributors of mutual funds and other fund-types products (collectively referred to as mutual funds ), which could adversely affect our business.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S14	The SEC may issue additional regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Dodd-Frank Act ) or other legislative authority that would require brokers and financial intermediaries that distribute mutual funds to make more detailed fee disclosures at the point-of-sale.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P22_S15	Additionally, brokers and financial intermediaries may become subject to new SEC and/or DOL-imposed fiduciary standards-of-care that could cause them to alter their methods of distribution and/or wholesaling activities.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We cannot predict the requirements the SEC or DOL may propose and finally adopt.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Regulations that would cause current distribution channels or interest in mutual fund investing to change could decrease the number of accounts on our systems as a result of changes in client offerings or the attractiveness of offerings to customers of our clients.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	This could adversely affect our business and operating results.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Additionally, to the extent the Dodd-Frank Act and/or DOL regulations impacts the operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business, those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs, reduce their capacity to transact, or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our clients are subject to regulation that could affect our business.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our clients are subject to extensive regulation, including investment adviser, broker/dealer and privacy regulations applicable to services we provide to the financial services industry and insurance, privacy and other regulations applicable to services we provide to the healthcare industry.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Changes in, and any violation by our clients of, applicable laws and regulations (whether related to the services we provide or otherwise) could diminish their business or financial condition and thus their demand for our products and services or could increase our cost of continuing to provide services to such industries.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Demand could also decrease if we do not continue to offer products and services that help our clients comply with regulations.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	For example, our accounts in our Healthcare Services segment are impacted by the ACA, including the Health Insurance Marketplace.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P24_S5	The implementation of the ACA is still in its early stages, and we cannot predict the impact it will have on our customers and their demand for our services.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our businesses expose us to risks of claims and losses that could be significant and damage our reputation and business prospects.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our proprietary applications and related consulting and other services include the processing or clearing of financial and healthcare transactions for our clients and their customers and the design of benefit plans and compliance programs.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The dollar amount of transactions processed or cleared is vastly higher than the revenues we derive from providing these services.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In the event we make transaction processing or operational errors, or mismanage any process, we could be exposed to claims for any resulting processing delays, disclosure of protected information, miscalculations, mishandling of pass-through disbursements or other processes, and failure to follow a client s instructions or meet specifications.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Additionally, we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from a failure of third parties (including regulatory authorities) to recognize the limitations of our role as our clients agent or consultant, and we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from fraud committed by third parties.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P25_S5	We may be exposed to the risk of counterparty breaches or failure to perform.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P25_S6	We may be subject to claims, including class actions, for reimbursements, losses or damages arising from any transaction processing or operational error, or from process mismanagement.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P25_S7	Because of the sensitive nature of the financial and healthcare transactions we process, our liability and any alleged damages may significantly exceed the fees we receive for performing the service at issue.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Litigation could include class action claims based, among other theories, upon various regulatory requirements and consumer protection and privacy laws that class action plaintiffs may attempt to use to assert private rights of action.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Any of these claims and related settlements or judgments could affect our operating results, damage our reputation, decrease demand for our services, or cause us to make costly operating changes.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We do not control certain businesses in which we have significant ownership.
714603_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We invest in joint ventures and other unconsolidated affiliates as part of our business strategy, and part of our net income is derived from our pro rata share of the earnings of those businesses.

714603_16_ITEM6_P1_S3	Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a useful basis for evaluating underlying business unit performance, but should not be considered in isolation and is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, evaluating business unit performance utilizing GAAP financial information.
714603_16_ITEM6_P1_S4	A description of the use of non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is below.
714603_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	In addition to reporting financial information on a GAAP basis, we have disclosed non-GAAP financial information which has been reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the following financial schedules titled Reconciliation of Reported Diluted Earnings per Share to Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share.
714603_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	In making these adjustments to determine the non-GAAP results, we take into account the impact of items that are not necessarily ongoing in nature, that do not have a high level of predictability associated with them or that are non-operational in nature.
714603_16_ITEM6_P3_S1	Generally, these items include net gains on dispositions of business units, net gains (losses) associated with securities and other investments, restructuring and impairment costs, and other similar items.
714603_16_ITEM6_P3_S2	Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a useful basis for evaluating underlying business unit performance, but should not be considered in isolation and is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, evaluating business unit performance utilizing GAAP financial information.
714603_16_ITEM6_P3_S3	Management uses non-GAAP measures in its budgeting and forecasting processes and to further analyze our financial trends and operational run-rate, as well as making financial comparisons to prior periods presented on a similar basis.
714603_16_ITEM6_P3_S4	We believe that providing such adjusted results allows investors and other users of our financial statements to better understand our comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
714603_16_ITEM6_P3_S5	DST s management uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures in its own evaluation of our performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods.
714603_16_ITEM6_P3_S6	Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.
714603_16_ITEM6_P3_S7	Although our management believes non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the performance of our business, we acknowledge that items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on our financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP.
714603_16_ITEM6_P3_S8	Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP results.
714603_16_ITEM6_P3_S9	These factors should be considered when evaluating our results.

714603_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	As a result, our revenue per account is generally higher for registered accounts than for subaccounts.

714603_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	On January 1, 2015, we acquired all of the membership interests of kasina LLC, a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry for $9.0 million of upfront cash consideration and up to $5.0 million of performance-related contingent consideration.
714603_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	The acquisition provides us with additional opportunities to provide a combination of advisory, research, technology and analytics to asset managers.
714603_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	On July 31, 2015, we acquired all of the membership interests of asset manager Red Rocks Capital LLC, which focuses on listed private equity and other private asset investments, for $45.0 million of upfront cash consideration and up to $20.0 million of performance-related contingent considerations.
714603_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	We expect the acquisition to provide us with additional opportunities within the alternative investment marketplace to enhance our ongoing asset management strategy.
714603_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	On August 21, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Wealth Management Systems Inc., a provider of technology-based rollover services, for $64.0 million of cash consideration.
714603_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	Wealth Management Systems Inc. automates the migration of assets from retirement plans to investment management platforms.
714603_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	We expect the acquisition to provide us with additional opportunities to expand rollover service options to new and existing customers and enhance our ongoing retirement and asset management strategies.
714603_16_ITEM7_P12_S5	On February 24, 2016, we acquired all of the membership interests of Kaufman Rossin Fund Services LLC ( KRFS ), for $95.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments.
714603_16_ITEM7_P12_S6	KRFS is an independent, full-service provider of specialized hedge fund administration services to the global financial community.
714603_16_ITEM7_P12_S7	KRFS hedge fund services include accounting and valuation, back-office outsourcing, investor services, treasury services, and customized reporting.
714603_16_ITEM7_P12_S8	We expect the acquisition to provide us with additional opportunities within the alternative investment marketplace and expand our asset administration service offerings.
714603_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	In December 2015, we entered into a ten year contract with a new client to provide both subaccounting and mutual fund servicing solutions.
714603_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Based on current volumes, the client is expected to convert approximately 10.0 million subaccounts onto our platform by the end of 2016 and approximately 2.3 million registered accounts onto our platform by the end of 2017.
714603_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Implementation efforts will result in increased costs as we convert the client onto our platforms over the course of 2016 and 2017.
714603_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	During 2014, we sold our wholly-owned U.K. subsidiary, DST Global Solutions Limited and certain related affiliates ( Global Solutions ).
714603_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Global Solutions provided post-trade, middle-, and back-office investment management software applications, implementation and other professional services.
714603_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	The Healthcare Services segment uses our proprietary software applications to provide healthcare organizations a variety of medical and pharmacy benefit solutions to satisfy their information processing, quality of care, cost management concerns and payment integrity programs, while achieving compliance and improving operational efficiencies.
714603_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	Our healthcare solutions include claims adjudication, benefit management, care management, business intelligence and other ancillary services.
714603_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	continue to expand and enhance our Healthcare Services offerings to ensure we are able to address the changing needs of our clients within the complex and highly regulated health industries which we serve.
714603_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	For example, our pharmacy management business continues to make investments to expand our clinical, network, and analytic capabilities to help our customers and prospective customers achieve the best possible outcomes for their members and to allow us to more effectively compete in the broader competitive pharmacy benefit manager ( PBM ) market.
714603_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Historically, we have acted as an agent within our pharmacy-solutions business and, accordingly, recognized revenue on a net basis.
714603_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	As our enhanced products evolve and we expand our pharmacy-solutions service offerings, we will evaluate the provisions within our new pharmacy network and customer contracts to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the transactions.
714603_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	If we determine that we are acting as a principal in the transactions, we will report the transactions on a gross basis, resulting in significantly higher revenues and costs reflected within our consolidated financial statements.
714603_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	We generally derive revenue from our pharmacy-solutions business on a transactional fee basis.
714603_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Fees are earned on pharmacy claims processing and payments services, pharmacy and member call center services, pharmaceutical rebate administration, administration or management of clinical programs, pharmacy network management, member and plan web services and management information and reporting.
714603_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	Further, revenues include investment earnings related to client cash balances maintained in our bank accounts.
714603_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	Medical claim processing revenues are generally derived from fees charged based on a per member/per month basis and transactional basis.
714603_16_ITEM7_P17_S4	We also realize revenue from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage or members increase.
714603_16_ITEM7_P17_S5	Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations.
714603_16_ITEM7_P17_S6	During 2015, we renewed our contract with a significant Healthcare Services client which extends our contract to provide them pharmacy claims processing, reporting and other administration services through June 2020.
714603_16_ITEM7_P17_S7	Effective January 2015, a significant client deconverted approximately 40% of their business with us.
714603_16_ITEM7_P17_S8	Subsequently, during mid-2015, we entered into a new multi-year contract with this existing client to provide administrative management of pharmacy claims for the client s commercial plan members.
714603_16_ITEM7_P17_S9	As a result of this agreement, the previously announced deconversion of this client s remaining members which was scheduled for 2015 and 2016 will not take place, and the client will remain on our pharmacy claims processing platform.
714603_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Customer Communications Segment Within our Customer Communications segment, we offer a full range of integrated print, mail, and electronic solutions to customers in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.
714603_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	We produce customized communications for our client s customers such as investment fund statements, explanation of health benefit statements, and monthly utility bills.
714603_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	We use proprietary and third- party software applications to provide the formatting, printing, mailing, electronic presentment and archiving of these types of communications.
714603_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	As one of the largest First-Class mailers in the U.S., we also provide a range of postal services to help clients optimize mail efficiencies and control postage expenses.
714603_16_ITEM7_P18_S4	Revenues in this segment are derived from presentation and delivery (either print or digital), mailing fees and archiving of customer documents, and are generally based on the number of images processed or packages mailed and the range of customization and personalization options chosen by the client.
714603_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	During 2015, we completed the sale and leaseback of our four North American Customer Communications production facilities for pretax proceeds totaling approximately $129.0 million.
714603_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	A pretax gain of approximately $39.9 million on the combined sale transactions will be deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the future lease terms.
714603_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	The U.S. and Canadian production facilities leases provide for initial terms of 14 years and 12.5 years, respectively, and further provide the Company with options to extend the lease terms for two consecutive five year terms at then fair market rents.
714603_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	The total rent payments for year one will be approximately $9.0 million and include 2% annual rent escalations, resulting in approximately $10.3 million of annual rent expense.
714603_16_ITEM7_P19_S4	Annual depreciation for the four facilities was approximately $6.1 million.
714603_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Investments and Other Segment The Investments and Other segment is comprised of our real estate consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, investments in equity securities, private equity investments and other financial interests.
714603_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	The assets held by this segment are primarily passive in nature.
714603_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	The Investments and Other segment s revenues are derived from rental income from third-party real estate leases.
714603_16_ITEM7_P20_S3	Rental income is recorded as revenue when, based on lease terms, it is earned.
714603_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Investments and Other segment records investment income (dividends, interest and net gains or losses on investment securities) within Other income, net.
714603_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Investments and Other segment derives part of its income from its pro rata share in the earnings or losses of certain unconsolidated affiliates.
714603_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	We make lease payments to certain real estate joint ventures.
714603_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Seasonality Generally, we do not have significant seasonal fluctuations in our business operations.
714603_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	Processing volumes for mutual fund customers within our Financial Services and Customer Communications segments are usually highest during the quarter ended March 31 due primarily to processing year-end transactions and printing and mailing of year-end statements and tax forms during January.
714603_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	We have historically added operating equipment in the last half of the year in preparation for processing year-end transactions, which has the effect of increasing costs for the second half of the year.
714603_16_ITEM7_P23_S3	Revenues and operating results from individual license sales vary depending on the timing and size of the contracts.
714603_16_ITEM7_P23_S4	New Authoritative Accounting Guidance See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 , Significant Accounting Policies - New authoritative accounting guidance.
714603_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
714603_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
714603_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
714603_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
714603_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; software capitalization and amortization; depreciation of fixed assets; valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill; accounting for investments; and accounting for income taxes.
714603_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned.
714603_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	The majority of our revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided.
714603_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all customer obligations have been met.
714603_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	We generally do not have payment terms from customers that extend beyond one year.
714603_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Billing for services in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.
714603_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectibility is reasonably assured.
714603_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	If there is a customer-specific acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of customer acceptance.
714603_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
714603_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration should be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
714603_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence, which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items.
714603_16_ITEM7_P27_S4	If such evidence is unavailable, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.
714603_16_ITEM7_P27_S5	We derive over 90% of our revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts.
714603_16_ITEM7_P27_S6	The majority of the amount is billed on a monthly basis, generally with thirty-day collection terms.
714603_16_ITEM7_P27_S7	Revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon performance of the services.
714603_16_ITEM7_P27_S8	In the event a portion of the arrangement fees are due 12 months or more from the invoice date, we have concluded that the fees do not meet the criteria for being fixed or determinable.
714603_16_ITEM7_P27_S9	In these cases, we recognize the revenue as the fees become due.
714603_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Our standard business practice is to bill monthly for development, consulting and training services on a time and materials basis.
714603_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	In some cases we bill a fixed fee for development and consulting services.
714603_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	For fixed fee arrangements, we recognize revenue on a proportionate performance basis.
714603_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	We derive less than 10% of our revenues from licensing products.
714603_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	We license our wealth management products, AWD products, healthcare administration processing software solutions and customer billing software solution products.
714603_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Perpetual software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Term software license revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement.
714603_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	While license fee revenues are not a significant percentage of our total operations, they can significantly impact earnings in the period in which they are recognized.
714603_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Revenues from individual license sales depend heavily on the timing, size and nature of the contract.
714603_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	We recognize revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectibility has been reasonably assured.
714603_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	DST may enter into arrangements with broker/dealers or other third parties to sell or market closed-end fund shares.
714603_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Depending on the arrangement, we may earn distribution fees for marketing and selling the underlying fund shares.
714603_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	Conversely, we may incur distribution expenses, including structuring fees, finders fees and referral fees paid to unaffiliated broker/dealers or introducing parties for marketing and selling underlying fund shares of a closed-end fund we sponsor.
714603_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	While distribution revenues and expenses are not significant percentages of our operating revenues or costs and expenses, they can significantly impact operations and earnings in the period in which they are recognized.
714603_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	We have entered into various agreements with related parties, principally unconsolidated affiliates, under which we provide data processing and software services.
714603_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	We believe that the terms of our contracts with related parties are fair to us and are no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties.
714603_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	We assess collection based on a variety of factors, including past collection history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer.
714603_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	We generally do not request collateral from our customers.
714603_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	If we determine that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.
714603_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	Allowances for billing adjustments and doubtful account expense are estimated as revenues are recognized.
714603_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	Allowances for billing adjustments are recorded as reductions in revenues and doubtful account expense is recorded within Costs and expenses.
714603_16_ITEM7_P35_S5	The annual amounts for these items are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
714603_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Software capitalization and amortization We make substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of our processing services as well as our sale of licensed products.
714603_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	We also develop a large portion of our software internally.
714603_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	We capitalize software development costs for computer software developed or obtained for internal use after the preliminary project phase has been completed and management has committed to funding the project.
714603_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	For computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed to third parties, we capitalize software development costs which are incurred after the products reach technological feasibility but prior to the general release of the product to customers.
714603_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_16_ITEM7_P38_S4	Significant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects.
714603_16_ITEM7_P38_S5	Management specifically evaluates software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts, milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects.
714603_16_ITEM7_P38_S6	Significant changes in any of these items may result in discontinuing capitalization of development costs, as well as immediately expensing previously capitalized costs.
714603_16_ITEM7_P38_S7	We review, on a quarterly basis, our capitalized software for possible impairment.
714603_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Depreciation of fixed assets Our approach on personal property, specifically technology equipment, printing and inserting equipment, is to own the property as opposed to leasing it where practicable.
714603_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	We believe this approach provides us with better flexibility for disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life.
714603_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	We depreciate technology equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives: (1) non-mainframe equipment three years; (2) mainframe central processing unit four years; and (3) mainframe direct access storage devices five years.
714603_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	We depreciate furniture and fixtures over estimated useful lives, principally three to five years, using accelerated depreciation methods.
714603_16_ITEM7_P39_S4	We depreciate large printing and inserting equipment used by the Customer Communications segment over a five to seven year life using accelerated depreciation methods.
714603_16_ITEM7_P39_S5	We depreciate leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements.
714603_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Management judgment is required in assigning economic lives to fixed assets.
714603_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	Management specifically analyzes fixed asset additions, remaining net book values and gain/loss upon disposition of fixed assets to determine the appropriateness of assigned economic lives.
714603_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	Significant changes in any of these items may result in changes in the economic life assigned and the resulting depreciation expense.
714603_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment.
714603_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	We evaluate the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and evaluate identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
714603_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	Factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy for the overall business; and significant negative industry or economic trends.
714603_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	When it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we assess actual impairment based on gross cash flows.
714603_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	Our assessment of goodwill for impairment includes a qualitative assessment that considers various factors, including growth in operating revenues and income from operations of our reporting units since our last quantitative assessment.
714603_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	Our last quantitative assessment was performed in 2014, in which the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units.
714603_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	Our quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment includes comparing the fair value to the net book value of our reporting units.
714603_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	We estimate fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches.
714603_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is necessary.
714603_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
714603_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	To measure the amount of any impairment loss, we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the affected reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
714603_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	Specifically, we allocate the fair value of the affected reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill.
714603_16_ITEM7_P43_S5	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.
714603_16_ITEM7_P43_S6	Our 2015 , 2014 and 2013 annual goodwill impairment tests determined that goodwill was not impaired.
714603_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Accounting for investments We have three significant types of investments: 1) investments in available-for-sale securities, the largest of which is our investment in State Street common stock; 2) investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which is comprised principally of BFDS, IFDS U.K., IFDS L.P. and certain real estate joint ventures; and 3) investments in private equity funds and other investments accounted for under the cost method.
714603_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	We account for investments in entities in which we own less than 20% and do not have significant influence in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, which requires us to designate our investments as trading or available-for-sale.
714603_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders equity.
714603_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	We record an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary.
714603_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our financial position.
714603_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	The equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities, partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where we are the limited partner) in which we have significant influence but do not control.
714603_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	We classify these investments as unconsolidated affiliates.
714603_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	Under the equity method, we recognize income or losses from our pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of our investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_16_ITEM7_P46_S4	The cost method of accounting is used for these investments when we have a de-minimus ownership percentage and do not have significant influence.
714603_16_ITEM7_P46_S5	Our cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.
714603_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Accounting for income taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance.
714603_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns.
714603_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).
714603_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.
714603_16_ITEM7_P47_S4	A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
714603_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
714603_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	We recognize liabilities for potential tax exposures based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be required.
714603_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, then we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary.
714603_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained if challenged by the taxing authorities.
714603_16_ITEM7_P48_S4	To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected.
714603_16_ITEM7_P48_S5	An unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_16_ITEM7_P48_S6	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes.

714603_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	We recorded $0.2 million , $2.2 million and $0.6 million of net impairments on private equity funds and other investments related to adverse market conditions and poor performance of the underlying investments during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments and may require an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our net income.
714603_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	In 2014 , we received cash dividends of $33.2 million from a cost method investment in a privately-held company.
714603_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	Following receipt of the dividend, we sold our remaining interest in the privately-held company, resulting in pre-tax cash proceeds and a related gain of $103.6 million .

714603_16_ITEM7_P58_S3	The price paid per share was determined in connection with the secondary offering of Argyros DST common stock in May 2014.
714603_16_ITEM7_P58_S4	In connection with this share repurchase, we recorded a non-cash gain of $18.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from the change in stock price between the date the share repurchase price became fixed and the settlement date.

714603_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, is as follows (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Additional condensed financial information of our significant operating unconsolidated affiliates, BFDS and IFDS, is presented below (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Equity in earnings of IFDS increased $10.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 , as compared to 2014 , primarily attributable to higher revenues recognized related to the ongoing client conversion activities of the wealth management platform clients in the U.K., organic growth at existing customers and new client processing revenues.
714603_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	Partially offsetting the increased revenues are higher operating costs as IFDS expands its infrastructure to prepare for the addition of new clients and associated service offerings as well as negative foreign currency impacts in both the U.K. and Canada.
714603_16_ITEM7_P61_S2	The multi-year implementation efforts for the previously announced two new clients are continuing to progress and are expected to be completed in phases over the next few years.
714603_16_ITEM7_P61_S3	In 2014, IFDS began capitalizing a significant portion of the software development costs being incurred to develop the wealth management platform for the U.K. market resulting in approximately 66.3 million ( 33.2 million at DST s 50% ownership) of capitalized costs through December 31, 2015 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P61_S4	These costs will continue to be incurred as the platform is completed.
714603_16_ITEM7_P61_S5	During 2015, IFDS migrated a portion of one of these clients accounts onto the wealth management platform.
714603_16_ITEM7_P61_S6	IFDS continues to work with these clients on the scope and timing of the remaining development and implementation efforts which will impact the timing of the recognition of these revenues associated with these activities, as well as the level of development efforts that will be self-funded by IFDS.
714603_16_ITEM7_P61_S7	During 2016, we anticipate that the combination of the lower development revenue, reduced capitalization of costs as IFDS shifts from development work to servicing the new clients, and the increased expense from the amortization of costs previously capitalized will reduce 2016 earnings from IFDS as compared to 2015.
714603_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Equity in earnings of IFDS increased $9.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 , as compared to 2013 , primarily attributable to revenues recognized related to the ongoing conversion activities of the wealth management clients in the U.K. IFDS shareowner accounts serviced on their shareowner accounting platform were 22.1 million at December 31, 2015 , a decrease of 1.7 million accounts or 7.1% as compared to December 31, 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The decrease was primarily due to the transition of one of IFDS clients off of the FAST platform and onto the wealth management platform, partially offset by organic growth and new client conversions.
714603_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	IFDS shareowner accounts serviced were 23.8 million at December 31, 2014 , an increase of 2.0 million accounts or 9.2% as compared to December 31, 2013 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	Equity in earnings of BFDS increased $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	The increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in operating costs.
714603_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	Equity in earnings of BFDS decreased $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P63_S4	The decrease was primarily attributable to lower shareowner processing revenues associated with reduced levels of accounts serviced, partially offset by higher revenues from ancillary services.
714603_16_ITEM7_P63_S5	Favorable reductions in BFDS operating expenses were largely offset by investments in ancillary product offerings and severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken during 2014.
714603_16_ITEM7_P63_S6	Our equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 , a decrease of $0.6 million as compared to 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P63_S7	The decrease was primarily due to a $5.7 million gain recognized upon the the sale of an unconsolidated affiliate during 2014, partially offset by a $3.6 million gain resulting from the sale of real estate by an unconsolidated affiliate during 2015.
714603_16_ITEM7_P63_S8	Our equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $11.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 , an increase of $6.1 million as compared to 2013 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P63_S9	The increase was primarily due to the sale of our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate which resulted in a gain of $5.7 million.
714603_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 32.7% , 25.1% and 35.3% for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	The effective tax rates in each of the three years ended December 31, 2015 were affected by tax benefits relating to certain international operations and recognition of state tax benefits associated with income apportionment rules.
714603_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	Our income tax rate for 2015 was favorably impacted by a $11.9 million benefit from the completion of the IRS examination of previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions, research and experimentation credits and capital losses for the period 2010 as well as other remeasurements during the period.
714603_16_ITEM7_P64_S3	Our effective income tax rate for 2014 was favorably impacted by the reversal of $30.3 million of uncertain tax position liabilities, net of additions, primarily related to statute expirations.
714603_16_ITEM7_P64_S4	Our effective income tax rate for 2013 was favorably impacted by a $16.1 million benefit from the completion of the IRS examination of previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions under Internal Revenue Code Section 199 and research and experimentation credits for the periods 2006 through 2009.
714603_16_ITEM7_P64_S5	The 2013 effective tax rate also included a tax expense of $7.5 million relating to an increase in the overall incremental U.S. tax expected to be imposed upon the repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings previously considered permanently reinvested.
714603_16_ITEM7_P64_S6	Excluding the effect of discrete period items, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36% in 2016 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P64_S7	The 2016 tax rate can be affected as a result of variances among the estimates and amounts of 2016 sources of taxable income (e.g., domestic consolidated, joint venture and/or international), the realization of tax credits, adjustments which may arise from the resolution of tax matters under review and our assessment of our liability for uncertain tax positions.
714603_16_ITEM7_P64_S8	YEAR TO YEAR BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARISONS FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT The following table presents the financial results of the Financial Services segment (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	The following table summarizes the Financial Services segment s statistical metrics (in millions, except as noted):
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Comparison of 2015 versus 2014 results Operating revenues Financial Services segment operating revenues of $1,092.7 million reflect a decrease of $24.8 million or 2.2% in 2015 as compared to 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	The decrease in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the sale of Global Solutions in November of 2014 and foreign currency movements.
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	Global Solutions contributed $61.4 million of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and foreign currency movements reduced operating revenue by approximately $16.2 million during 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S3	Excluding Global Solutions 2014 results and the foreign currency impacts, Financial Services operating revenues increased $52.8 million or 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 , primarily driven from year-over-year growth across a number of our service offerings.
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S4	Specifically, operating revenues increased as a result of increased professional services revenue associated with our Bluedoor wealth management platform business as well as organic and new client growth within our Retirement and Brokerage Solutions businesses.
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S5	Additionally, the businesses acquired during 2015 have contributed $10.4 million of operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S6	The increases were partially offset by decreased revenue from our U.S. registered shareowner account processing due to lower registered accounts primarily as a result of subaccounting conversions.
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S7	Additionally, software license revenues (excluding Global Solutions) were $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , a decrease of $0.4 million as compared to 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S8	Costs and expenses Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $902.5 million , a decrease of $1.4 million as compared to 2014 .

714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S11	Additionally, Global Solutions incurred $49.3 million of costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 and foreign currency movements reduced costs and expenses by $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S12	Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, the Global Solutions 2014 results and foreign currency impacts, Financial Services costs and expenses increased $21.6 million or 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S13	On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2015 was primarily from acquisitions completed during 2015, which included approximately $6.2 million of incremental expenses related to amortization associated with acquired intangibles and performance-related contingent consideration.
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S14	The increase in costs and expenses was also attributable to increased security, regulatory compliance and network infrastructure costs, as well as higher costs associated with new business initiatives as we expand our service offerings and expand our Bluedoor wealth management platform in the U.K.
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S15	These costs and expenses were partially offset by lower transaction and advisory costs of $1.2 million in 2015 as compared to $5.6 million of advisory and transaction costs incurred during 2014 in connection with the Argyros transaction and $13.0 million of costs incurred in 2014 related to restructuring activities.
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S16	Depreciation and amortization Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $72.0 million , a decrease of $0.4 million or 0.6% as compared to 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S17	The decrease in 2015 was primarily attributable to the sale of Global Solutions in 2014, partially offset by increased amortization costs associated with acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed during 2015.
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S18	Income from operations Financial Services segment income from operations for 2015 was $188.6 million , a decrease of $13.1 million or 6.5% as compared to 2014 .

714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S21	The decrease in Financial Services income from operations was primarily from higher operating expenses due to investments in our systems and infrastructure and the development of new business initiatives.
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S22	Income from operations was also adversely impacted by approximately $6.2 million of incremental expense resulting from amortization of acquired intangibles and expense for performance-related contingent consideration associated with our 2015 acquisitions.
714603_16_ITEM7_P66_S23	These decreases were partially offset by lower costs incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken in 2014.
714603_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Comparison of 2014 versus 2013 results Operating revenues Financial Services segment operating revenues of $1,117.5 million increased $54.2 million or 5.1% in 2014 as compared to 2013 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013 was primarily from higher operating revenues within our ALPS business.
714603_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	ALPS operating revenues increased over the comparable prior year periods as a result of net positive funds flow and favorable market conditions which contributed to the growth of assets under management within the ALPS proprietary funds and increases in other ALPS distribution and services revenues.
714603_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	Also contributing to the increased operating revenues was an increase in subaccounts processed as a result of organic growth from existing clients and new clients.
714603_16_ITEM7_P67_S4	Excluding a $6.0 million contract termination payment received in 2013, our operating revenues from retirement solutions increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 principally from higher professional services fee revenue and higher participants as a result of the conversion of new clients.
714603_16_ITEM7_P67_S5	Operating revenues also increased in 2014 due to higher professional services revenue from the implementation and configuration of new wealth management clients.
714603_16_ITEM7_P67_S6	The increase in Financial Services operating revenues were partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other foreign currencies.
714603_16_ITEM7_P67_S7	Financial Services operating revenues included approximately $41.2 million of software license fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 , an increase of $3.1 million as compared to 2013 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P67_S8	The growth in operating revenues was partially offset by the sale of Global Solutions on November 30, 2014.
714603_16_ITEM7_P67_S9	Global Solutions operating revenue decreased $9.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to one less month of operations in 2014.

714603_16_ITEM7_P68_S5	We also incurred higher restructuring charges and advisory and other transaction costs during 2014, primarily as a result of a $13.0 million charge resulting from the restructuring event implemented during 2014 to reduce our workforce and consolidate certain facilities to enhance operational efficiency within the Financial Services segment and $5.6 million of advisory and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the agreement reached with Argyros in 2014.
714603_16_ITEM7_P68_S6	These increases in costs and expenses were partially offset by lower mark-to-market losses on deferred compensation liabilities (the effect of which is offset within other income), changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other foreign currencies and lower expenses associated with the fund launched by ALPS of $2.8 million in 2013 that did not recur in 2014.

714603_16_ITEM7_P86_S5	In October 2015, we initiated our first investment under this seed capital program with a $25.0 million investment into a newly launched open-end fund.
714603_16_ITEM7_P86_S6	Additionally, in October 2015 we completed the sale and leaseback of our four North American Customer Communications production facilities which resulted in pretax proceeds totaling approximately $129.0 million.
714603_16_ITEM7_P86_S7	Information on our consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows, categorized by operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.
714603_16_ITEM7_P86_S8	Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities were $220.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 .

714603_16_ITEM7_P86_S17	Operating cash flows during 2013 resulted principally from net income of $352.6 million, adjustments for non-cash net gains of $74.3 million and $129.4 million in dividends from unconsolidated affiliates (including a $125.0 million dividend received from BFDS) resulting in net cash flows of $407.7 million .
714603_16_ITEM7_P86_S18	Cash provided from operating activities also included a $12.5 million use of cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities.
714603_16_ITEM7_P86_S19	The significant operating assets and liabilities changes during 2013 included a decrease in accounts receivable of $15.8 million , a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $20.7 million, and a decrease in income payable of $12.8 million primarily due to timing of payments.
714603_16_ITEM7_P86_S20	We have had significant proceeds from the sale of investments during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 which have been included within investing activities on the Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_16_ITEM7_P86_S21	The income taxes paid on the gains from these investment sales are required to be treated as an operating cash outflow.
714603_16_ITEM7_P86_S22	Income tax expense resulting from these investment sales will reduce operating cash flows in the period that taxes are paid.
714603_16_ITEM7_P86_S23	Income taxes paid related to gains on the sale of investments and other non-operating assets during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $87.1 million , $70.4 million and $73.5 million , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Software Development and Maintenance Our software development and maintenance efforts are focused on introducing new products and services as well as enhancing existing products and services.
714603_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	The following table summarizes software development, maintenance and enhancements to our proprietary systems and software products which are included in net income within cash flows from operations (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Investing Activities Cash flows provided by investing activities were $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	Sources of our cash inflows were primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $192.2 million , which includes $176.1 million of pretax proceeds from the sale of State Street stock.
714603_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	Additionally, in October 2015 we completed the sale and leaseback of our four North American Customer Communications production facilities which resulted in pretax proceeds totaling approximately $129.0 million.
714603_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	The proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our Canadian production facility were repatriated to the U.S.
714603_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Primary uses of cash include $111.2 million of capital expenditures, higher restricted cash for client fund obligations, cash used to acquire kasina LLC, Red Rocks Capital LLC and Wealth Management Systems Inc. during 2015 and investments within the newly launched open-end fund.
714603_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	Cash flows provided by investing activities during 2014 of $304.7 million were primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $343.0 million , which includes $190.3 million of pretax proceeds from the sale of State Street stock.
714603_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	Additionally, in 2014 cash flows from investing activities increased due to proceeds received from sale of Global Solutions of $77.4 million and proceeds from sale of non-operating real estate of $32.6 million .
714603_16_ITEM7_P89_S3	These cash inflows were partially offset by capital expenditures of $113.4 million .
714603_16_ITEM7_P89_S4	Cash flows provided by investing activities were $310.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $332.9 million , which includes $148.8 million of pretax proceeds from the sale of State Street stock.
714603_16_ITEM7_P89_S5	Additionally, in 2013 cash flows from investing activities increased $71.5 million due to lower restricted cash held for pharmacy processing client fund obligations.
714603_16_ITEM7_P89_S6	These cash inflows were partially offset by capital expenditures of $102.8 million .
714603_16_ITEM7_P89_S7	The following table summarizes capital expenditures by segment (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	During 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we capitalized software development costs of $23.5 million , $28.8 million and $28.4 million , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	Additionally, we used debt to acquire approximately $2.5 million of equipment during 2013 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	Capital expenditures using debt are treated as non-cash transactions and are not included in the annual capital expenditure amounts above.
714603_16_ITEM7_P90_S3	We anticipate our 2016 capital expenditures to total approximately $100.0 million.
714603_16_ITEM7_P90_S4	Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded primarily by cash flows from operating activities or through borrowings on our revolving credit facilities.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Financing Activities Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $284.8 million , $528.0 million and $731.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	Common Stock Issuances and Repurchases We received cash proceeds of $11.8 million , $13.0 million and $30.6 million from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of employee stock options during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	The value of shares received in exchange for satisfaction of the exercise price and for tax-withholding obligations arising from the exercise of options to purchase our stock or from the vesting of restricted shares are included in Common stock repurchased in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S3	During January 2015, we spent $50.0 million to purchase 0.5 million shares which completed an existing share repurchase plan authorized in 2014.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S4	On January 28, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new $250.0 million share repurchase plan, which allows, but does not require, the repurchase of common stock in open market and private transactions, and on July 29, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $250.0 million of share repurchases, which is incremental to the existing plan.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S5	We repurchased an additional 3.1 million shares of our common stock for $350.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 , resulting in approximately $150.0 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan authorized in 2015.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S6	Under previous share repurchase plans, we expended $200.0 million for approximately 2.2 million shares and $252.6 million for approximately 3.4 million shares during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S7	As of March 23, 2014, Argyros beneficially owned 9.2 million shares or approximately 22% of DST common shares.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S8	During March 2014, we entered into an agreement under which we agreed to a two-step process to assist Argyros with the disposition of a substantial portion of its common stock ownership in DST.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S9	To implement Argyros disposition, we facilitated the May 2014 registered, secondary common stock offering of $450.0 million (before any overallotment option) of DST common stock beneficially owned by Argyros.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S10	Concurrent with the closing of the secondary offering and based upon a price determined in the secondary offering, DST repurchased, and simultaneously retired, 2.4 million shares of our common stock from Argyros for $200.0 million.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S11	In connection with this share repurchase, we recorded a non-cash gain of $18.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from the change in stock price between the date the share repurchase price became fixed and the settlement date.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S12	Dividends We paid cash dividends of $1.20 per common share in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S13	The total cash paid for dividends in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $43.1 million , $47.6 million and $51.8 million , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S14	On January 27, 2016 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 per share on our common stock, payable on March 15, 2016 , to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2016 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S15	Future cash dividends will depend upon financial condition, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S16	Client Funds Obligations Client funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S17	In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency client balances invested overnight.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S18	We had $533.4 million , $399.6 million and $ 366.5 million of client funds obligations at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S19	Debt Activity During 2015 , we had the following primary sources of debt financing: our syndicated revolving credit facility; subsidiary line of credit facilities; accounts receivable securitization program; and privately placed senior notes (the Senior Notes ).
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S20	We had $562.1 million , $552.9 million and $683.0 million of debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, an increase of $9.2 million during 2015 and a decrease of $130.1 million during 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S21	The increase in debt outstanding during 2015 was primarily from higher borrowings on the syndicated revolving credit facility, partially offset by the repayment of the Series A Senior Notes and the pay down of the accounts receivable securitization line.
714603_16_ITEM7_P91_S22	In 2015 , we renewed our accounts receivable securitization program for a three year term through May 2018.
714603_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	The decrease in debt outstanding during 2014 was primarily from the repayment of the $125.0 million term loan credit facility in June 2014.
714603_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	Our debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary indebtedness, asset dispositions and require certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	We are currently in compliance with these covenants.
714603_16_ITEM7_P93_S2	A default under certain of our borrowings could trigger defaults under certain of our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in their maturities being accelerated.
714603_16_ITEM7_P93_S3	Our debt arrangements are described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
714603_16_ITEM7_P93_S4	The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Interest obligations on our outstanding debt are not included in the table above.
714603_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	The syndicated revolving credit facility contains grid schedules that adjust borrowing costs up or down based upon our consolidated leverage ratio.
714603_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	The grid schedules may result in fluctuations in borrowing costs ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% over Eurodollar and 0.00% to 0.70% over base rate , as defined.
714603_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Senior Notes have fixed interest rates and are comprised of $105.0 million of 4.86% Series B Senior Notes, $65.0 million of 5.06% Series C Senior Notes and $160.0 million of 5.42% Series D Senior Notes.
714603_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	In addition to the financial instruments listed above, the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization program are determined based on variable interest rates associated with LIBOR.
714603_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	We have liabilities for income tax uncertainties of $73.8 million at December 31, 2015 .
714603_16_ITEM7_P97_S2	These obligations are classified as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as resolution of these matters is expected to take more than a year; however, the ultimate timing of resolution is uncertain.
714603_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	Other Commercial Commitments In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products and other business assets, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters.
714603_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties.
714603_16_ITEM7_P98_S2	These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.
714603_16_ITEM7_P98_S3	At December 31, 2015, except for certain immaterial items, there were no liabilities for guarantees or indemnifications as it is not possible to determine either the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements or the timing of any such payments due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
714603_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	Historically, payments made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
714603_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.
714603_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	We believe that our guarantee arrangements will not have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures, capital resources, liquidity or results of operations.
714603_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	These arrangements are described above and in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Available-for-sale equity price risk Our investments in available-for-sale equity securities are subject to price risk.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The fair value of our available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $219.5 million .
714603_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The impact of a 10% change in fair value of these investments would be approximately $13.6 million to comprehensive income.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Changes in equity values of our investments have had and could have a material effect on our comprehensive income (loss) and financial position.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest rate risk We and certain of our joint ventures derive service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which we are the agent for clients.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The balances maintained in the bank accounts will fluctuate.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2015 , DST and BFDS had average daily cash balances of approximately $2.0 billion maintained in such accounts, of which approximately $1.2 billion were maintained at BFDS.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We estimate that a 100 basis point change in interest earnings rate would equal approximately $6.7 million of net income (loss).
714603_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	At December 31, 2015 , we had $562.1 million of debt, of which $226.1 million was subject to variable interest rates (Federal Funds rates, LIBOR rates, Prime rates).
714603_16_ITEM7A_P1_S5	We estimate that a 10% increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact to our consolidated pretax earnings or to the fair value of our debt.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P1_S6	The effect of changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt is mitigated by changes in interest rates attributable to balance earnings.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate risk The operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in our exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The principal currencies involved are the British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Thai baht and Indian rupee.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our international subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	We translate our assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and translate income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Currency exchange rate fluctuations have not historically significantly affected our consolidated financial results.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	At December 31, 2015 , our international subsidiaries had approximately $276.6 million in total assets and for the year ended December 31, 2015 , these international subsidiaries recorded net income of approximately $18.6 million .
714603_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	We estimate that a 10% change in exchange rates could change total consolidated assets by approximately $27.7 million .
714603_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	Furthermore, a 10% change in exchange rates based upon historical earnings in international operations could change consolidated net income for 2015 by approximately $1.9 million .
714603_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We have entered into foreign currency cash flow and economic hedging programs to mitigate the impact of movements in foreign currency (principally British pound, Canadian dollar and Thai baht) on our operations.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The total notional value of our foreign currency derivatives is $138.9 million at December 31, 2015 .
714603_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 .
714603_16_ITEM7A_P5_S3	We estimate that a 10% change in exchange rates would result in a $0.6 million change in other comprehensive income.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $0.1 million at December 31, 2015 .
714603_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	We estimate a 10% change in exchange rates on these contracts would result in a $6.7 million change to consolidated net income.
714603_16_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Gains and losses on the derivative instruments are largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in a minimal impact on earnings.
714603_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Stockholders of DST Systems, Inc.:
714603_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DST Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
714603_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
714603_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
714603_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
714603_16_ITEM8_P1_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
714603_16_ITEM8_P1_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
714603_16_ITEM8_P1_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
714603_16_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
714603_16_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
714603_16_ITEM8_P1_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
714603_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
714603_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
714603_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
714603_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

714603_16_ITEM8_P9_S2	We manage our business through our three operating segments, Financial Services, Healthcare Services and Customer Communications.
714603_16_ITEM8_P9_S3	Investments in equity securities, private equity investments, real estate and certain financial interests have been aggregated into the Investments and Other segment.
714603_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	Beginning in 2015, we modified our reportable segment presentation to reflect changes in how we now operate the business and make resource allocations.
714603_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	Certain operations, including the electronic presentment services for our financial services customers and our retirement plan participant communications and enrollment materials services, are now presented in the Financial Services segment rather than the Customer Communications segment.
714603_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	Additionally, real estate utilized principally by our business operations has been reclassified from our Investments and Other segment to the segment that utilizes the property.
714603_16_ITEM8_P10_S3	Real estate primarily occupied by third parties or unoccupied remains within Investments and Other segment under the revised presentation.
714603_16_ITEM8_P10_S4	Prior periods have been revised to reflect the new reportable segments.
714603_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	The consolidated financial statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company.
714603_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
714603_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	We consolidate any entity in which we have a controlling financial interest.
714603_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	Under the voting interest model, generally the investor that has voting control (usually more than 50% of an entity s voting interests) consolidates the entity.
714603_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	Under the variable interest entity ( VIE ) model, the party that has the power to direct the entity s most significant economic activities and the ability to participate in the entity s economics consolidates the entity.
714603_16_ITEM8_P13_S2	An entity is considered a VIE if it possesses one of the following characteristics: 1) the entity is thinly capitalized; 2) residual equity holders do not control the entity; 3) equity holders are shielded from economic losses; 4) equity holders do not participate fully in an entity s residual economics; and 5) the entity was established with non-substantive voting interests.
714603_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	For consolidated subsidiaries that are less than wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as non-controlling interests.
714603_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	Non-controlling interests that are redeemable or convertible for cash or other assets at the option of the holder are classified separate from stockholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_16_ITEM8_P14_S2	The portion of net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest for such subsidiaries is presented as net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	We have the following significant operating joint ventures: Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. ( BFDS International Financial Data Services, U.K. ( IFDS U.K. and International Financial Data Services, L.P. ( IFDS L.P. ).
714603_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	We do not have a controlling financial interest in these entities and therefore account for the financial results of these operating joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.
714603_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	We are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering a large portion of our Kansas City, Missouri-based leased office facilities.
714603_16_ITEM8_P15_S3	The lessors are generally joint ventures (in which we have a 50% ownership) that have been established specifically to purchase, finance and engage in leasing activities with the joint venture partners and unrelated third parties.
714603_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Our analysis of our real estate joint ventures for all periods presented indicate that none qualified as a VIE and, accordingly, they have not been consolidated.
714603_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	We provide investment management services to, and have transactions with, various exchange traded funds, mutual funds and other investment products sponsored by the Company in the normal course of business.
714603_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	We generally are considered to have a controlling financial interest in a fund when we own a majority of the outstanding controlling shares, which may arise as a result of seed capital investments in newly launched investment products from the time of initial launch to the time that the fund becomes majority-held by third-party investors.
714603_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
714603_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
714603_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned.
714603_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	The majority of our revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided.
714603_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all customer obligations have been met.
714603_16_ITEM8_P19_S3	We generally do not have payment terms from customers that extend beyond one year.
714603_16_ITEM8_P19_S4	Revenue from operating leases is recognized monthly as the rent accrues.
714603_16_ITEM8_P19_S5	Billing for services in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.
714603_16_ITEM8_P19_S6	Allowances for billing adjustments and doubtful account expense are estimated as revenues are recognized.
714603_16_ITEM8_P19_S7	Allowances for billing adjustments are recorded as reductions in revenues and doubtful account expense is recorded within Costs and expenses.
714603_16_ITEM8_P19_S8	The annual amounts for these items are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
714603_16_ITEM8_P19_S9	We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectibility is reasonably assured.
714603_16_ITEM8_P19_S10	If there is a customer-specific acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of customer acceptance.
714603_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
714603_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
714603_16_ITEM8_P20_S3	Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence, which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items.
714603_16_ITEM8_P20_S4	If such evidence is unavailable, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.
714603_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	Software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	Deferral of software license revenue results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_16_ITEM8_P21_S2	We recognize revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectibility has been reasonably assured.
714603_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket ( OOP ) expenses, such as postage and telecommunications charges, are recorded as revenue on an accrual basis.
714603_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	Because these additional revenues are offset by the reimbursable expenses incurred, they have minimal impact on income from operations and net income.
714603_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	For each segment, total revenues are reported in two categories, operating revenues and OOP reimbursements.
714603_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	OOP expenses are included in costs and expenses.
714603_16_ITEM8_P22_S4	Costs and expenses Costs and expenses include all costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, incurred to produce revenues.
714603_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	We believe that the nature of our business as well as our organizational structure, in which virtually all officers and associates have operational responsibilities, does not allow for a meaningful segregation of selling, general and administrative costs.
714603_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	These costs, which we believe to be immaterial, are also included in costs and expenses.
714603_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	Substantially all depreciation and amortization is directly associated with the production of revenues.
714603_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Cash equivalents Short-term liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents.
714603_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	Due to the short-term nature of these investments, carrying value approximates market value.
714603_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	Client funds/obligations Funds held on behalf of clients In connection with providing data processing services for our clients, we may hold client funds on behalf of transfer agency clients and pharmacy processing clients.
714603_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	End-of-day available client bank balances for full service mutual fund transfer agency clients are invested overnight.
714603_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Invested balances are returned to the full service mutual fund transfer agency client accounts the following business day.
714603_16_ITEM8_P27_S2	Funds received from clients for the payment of pharmacy claims incurred by its members are invested until the claim payments are presented to the bank.
714603_16_ITEM8_P27_S3	These amounts are included in funds held on behalf of clients in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent assets that are restricted for use.
714603_16_ITEM8_P27_S4	Client funding receivable Client funding receivables represent amounts due to us for pharmacy claims paid in advance of receiving client funding and for pharmacy claims processed for which client funding requests have not been made.
714603_16_ITEM8_P27_S5	Client funds obligations Client funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us.
714603_16_ITEM8_P27_S6	In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency client balances invested overnight.
714603_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	We have reported the cash flows related to the purchases of investment funds (available-for-sale securities) held on behalf of clients and the cash flows related to the proceeds from the sales/maturities of investment funds held on behalf of clients on a gross basis in the investing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	We have reported the cash inflows and outflows related to client fund investments on a net basis within net (increase) decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations in the investing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	We have reported the cash flows related to client funds used in investing activities on a net basis within net increase (decrease) in client funds obligations in the financing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Inventories Inventories are comprised primarily of paper and envelope stocks.
714603_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	Inventories, which are included as a component of Current Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are stated at the lower of cost or market.
714603_16_ITEM8_P29_S2	Cost for substantially all of our inventories is determined on an average cost basis.
714603_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Investments The equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities, partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where we are the limited partner) in which we have significant influence but do not control.
714603_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	Under the equity method, we recognize income or losses from our pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of our investment in and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_16_ITEM8_P30_S3	The cost method of accounting is used for these investments when we have a deminimus ownership percentage and do not have significant influence.
714603_16_ITEM8_P30_S4	Our cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.
714603_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Investments classified as available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income.
714603_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Investments in trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.
714603_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	Investments classified as held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
714603_16_ITEM8_P31_S3	Investment funds which are consolidated as a result of our seed capital investment are considered investment companies and therefore we retain the specialized industry accounting principles of these investment products in our consolidated financial statements.
714603_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Upon consolidation of a fund, the underlying securities of the fund are reflected at fair value with gains and losses included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Security transactions and investment income Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date.
714603_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	Security gains and losses are calculated on the specific identification method.
714603_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.
714603_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	Interest income, adjusted for discounts and premiums, is recorded on the accrual basis.
714603_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	Property and equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost with major additions and improvements capitalized.
714603_16_ITEM8_P34_S3	Cost includes the amount of interest cost associated with significant capital additions.
714603_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Depreciation of buildings is recorded using the straight-line method over 30 to 40 years.
714603_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	Technology equipment, furniture, fixtures and other equipment are depreciated using accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives, principally three to five years.
714603_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	Software is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, generally three to five years.
714603_16_ITEM8_P35_S3	We depreciate large printing and inserting equipment used by the Customer Communications segment using accelerated methods over a five to seven year life.
714603_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements.
714603_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	We review, on a quarterly basis, our property and equipment for possible impairment.
714603_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	We capitalize costs for the development of internal use software, including coding and software configuration costs and costs of upgrades and enhancements, after the preliminary project phase has been completed and management has committed to funding the project.
714603_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis, depending on the nature of the project, generally over a three to five year period.
714603_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	We review, on a quarterly basis, our capitalized software for possible impairment.
714603_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	Development costs for software that will be sold or licensed to third parties, prior to the achievement of technological feasibility, are expensed as incurred.
714603_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	We capitalize software development costs for software that will be sold or licensed to third parties which are incurred after the products reach technological feasibility but prior to the general release of the product to customers.
714603_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	These capitalized development costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis using the greater of the amount computed by taking the ratio of current year s gross revenues to current and anticipated future gross revenues or the amount computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the product, which is generally three to five years.
714603_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	We evaluate the net realizable value of capitalized software development costs on a product-by-product basis.
714603_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets We have recorded goodwill and intangible assets in connection with various acquisitions of businesses.
714603_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Intangible assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily represent customer relationships and other definite lived intangible assets (trade names, non-compete agreements, etc.) acquired.
714603_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	The estimated useful life on these intangible assets ranges from 3 to 19 years.
714603_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	The weighted average amortization period at December 31, 2015 for customer relationships and other intangible assets is 14.9 and 9.0 years, respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	We assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and assess identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
714603_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	Intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.
714603_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	Our assessment of goodwill for impairment includes a qualitative assessment that considers various factors, including growth in operating revenues and income from operations of our reporting units since our last quantitative assessment.
714603_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Our last quantitative assessment was performed in 2014, in which the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units.
714603_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows.
714603_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	Our 2015 , 2014 and 2013 annual goodwill impairment tests determined that goodwill was not impaired.
714603_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Income taxes We recognize the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.
714603_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	Deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the liability method.
714603_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and differences between the income tax and financial accounting statement bases of assets and liabilities and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment.
714603_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	The income statement effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes on the balance sheet.
714603_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	From time to time, we enter into transactions for which the tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code or applicable state tax laws is uncertain.
714603_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	We provide federal and/or state income taxes on such transactions, together with related interest, net of income tax benefit, and any applicable penalties in accordance with accounting guidance for income tax uncertainties.
714603_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	We record income tax uncertainties that are estimated to take more than 12 months to resolve as non-current.
714603_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are recorded in income tax expense.
714603_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	Foreign currency translation Our international subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency.
714603_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	We translate our assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates.
714603_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	Income and expense accounts are translated at average rates during the period.
714603_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	Diluted earnings per share are determined by including the dilutive effect of all potential common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	See Note 12 , Equity , for additional details regarding our earnings per share computation.
714603_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	Derivative and hedging activities We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value and the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
714603_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	From time to time, we utilize derivatives to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
714603_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	We do not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes.
714603_16_ITEM8_P56_S2	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had derivative instruments outstanding as described in Note 10 , Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments .
714603_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	Comprehensive income Our comprehensive income consists of net income and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, our proportional share of unconsolidated affiliates other comprehensive income (limited by the carrying value of the investment), unrealized gains or losses on our cash flow hedges and foreign currency translation adjustments, which are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, net of tax and reclassifications to earnings.
714603_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	Share-based compensation We have share-based compensation plans covering our employees and our non-employee directors and have outstanding share awards (primarily in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units) under each of these plans.
714603_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	We recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards offset by estimates of compensation costs related to awards that are not expected to vest.
714603_16_ITEM8_P57_S3	For share-based awards granted, we expense the grant date fair value of these awards using the straight-line method over the service period.
714603_16_ITEM8_P57_S4	Amortization for the grant date fair value of share-based awards containing both service and performance features depends on our judgments on whether the performance conditions will be achieved.
714603_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standard update, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
714603_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	This standard requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
714603_16_ITEM8_P58_S2	This standard is effective prospectively or retrospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.
714603_16_ITEM8_P58_S3	We elected to early adopt this standard and have applied it prospectively beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015.
714603_16_ITEM8_P58_S4	Prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted.
714603_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts in a business combination that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
714603_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	Effects on earnings as a result of the change to the provisional amounts should be recorded in the same period s financial statements and calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.
714603_16_ITEM8_P60_S2	The guidance is effective January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted.
714603_16_ITEM8_P60_S3	We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance which requires that inventory within the scope of the guidance be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
714603_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted.
714603_16_ITEM8_P61_S2	We do not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	In May 2015, the FASB issued guidance which removes the requirement to categorize investments within the fair value hierarchy for which fair value is measured using the net asset value practical expedient.
714603_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2016 and requires retrospective application for each prior period presented.
714603_16_ITEM8_P62_S2	We elected to early adopt this standard and applied this standard retrospectively beginning in fourth quarter 2015.
714603_16_ITEM8_P62_S3	The adoption did not have a significant impact our consolidated balance sheet, statement of income or statement of cash flows as the guidance relates to financial statement disclosures only.
714603_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
714603_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted.
714603_16_ITEM8_P63_S2	The guidance is a change in financial statement presentation only and will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial results.
714603_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance that will help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement.
714603_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2016.

714603_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, Consolidated (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.
714603_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	The new consolidation guidance changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a Variable Interest Entity ( VIE ), and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE.
714603_16_ITEM8_P65_S2	It also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities.
714603_16_ITEM8_P65_S3	The guidance is effective for us beginning in first quarter 2016.
714603_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.

714603_16_ITEM8_P67_S2	Early adoption of this standard is permitted as of January 2017.
714603_16_ITEM8_P67_S3	We are currently evaluating the standard, including which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.

714603_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	Fair Value Measurements Authoritative accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
714603_16_ITEM8_P96_S1	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
714603_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we held certain investment assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
714603_16_ITEM8_P97_S1	These investment assets include money market funds, available-for-sale equity securities and trading securities whereby fair value is determined using quoted prices in active markets.
714603_16_ITEM8_P97_S2	Accordingly, the fair value measurements of these investments have been classified as Level 1 in the table below.
714603_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	Fair value for deferred compensation liabilities that are credited with deemed gains or losses of the underlying hypothetical investments, primarily equity securities, has been classified as Level 1 in the tables below.
714603_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	In addition, we have interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments that are required to be reported at fair value.
714603_16_ITEM8_P98_S2	Fair value for the derivative instruments was determined using inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are directly or indirectly observable.
714603_16_ITEM8_P98_S3	Accordingly, our derivative instruments have been classified as Level 2 in the tables below.
714603_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	The following tables present assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):

714603_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 and at other times if a significant change in circumstances indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced.
714603_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	The valuation of goodwill requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows, market multiples and discount rates.
714603_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	Our 2015 annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units.
714603_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	In connection with the sale of Global Solutions on November 30, 2014, $7.4 million of the goodwill within the Financial Services segment was allocated to the business sold and therefore removed along with the other net assets of the business sold.

714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	Under the terms of the accounts receivable securitization program, (a) we periodically acquire accounts receivable originated by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, DST Output, DST Health Solutions, DST Technologies and Argus Health Systems (the Subsidiary Originators ), (b) we transfer receivables originated by us and receivables acquired from the Subsidiary Originators, on a periodic basis, to a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of DST (the SPE ), and (c) the SPE then sells undivided interests in the receivables to the bank.
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	We retain servicing responsibility over the receivables.
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S2	The program contains customary restrictive covenants as well as customary events of default.
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S3	We have continuing involvement with the transferred assets because we maintain servicing responsibilities for the accounts receivable assets included in the accounts receivable securitization program.
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S4	Accounts receivable assets transferred from us to our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary contain restrictions because they are not available to satisfy the creditors of any other person, including DST or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates.
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S5	Further, neither we nor the SPE guarantees collectibility of the receivables or the creditworthiness of obligors.
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S6	The SPE retains an interest in the receivables in excess of the amount transferred to the conduit, and such receivables continue to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S7	The carrying value of the retained interest approximates its estimated fair value at the balance sheet date.
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S8	We believe increases in the level of assumed interest rates and/or credit losses compared to assumptions in effect at the balance sheet date by 10% or 20% would not materially affect the fair value of the retained interest at the reporting date.
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S9	There was no outstanding amount under the program at December 31, 2015 .
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S10	The outstanding amount under the program was $120.0 million at December 31, 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S11	During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 total proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program were approximately $1,037.7 million , $1,024.7 million and $1,005.2 million , respectively, and total repayments were approximately $1,157.7 million , $1,054.7 million and $990.2 million , respectively, which comprise the net cash flow in the financing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S12	Aggregate transfers of undivided interests in the receivables from the SPE to the bank were $1,807.2 million and $1,758.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P115_S13	The impact on net income stemming from these transfers was not material.
714603_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	Costs associated with the accounts receivable securitization program are included in interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_16_ITEM8_P116_S1	The program costs applicable to the outstanding amount of undivided interests in the receivables are generally based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
714603_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	Revolving credit facilities On October 1, 2014, we entered into a new syndicated credit facility ( Credit Facility ).
714603_16_ITEM8_P117_S1	The Credit Facility provides for a revolving unsecured line in an aggregate principal amount of up to $850.0 million .
714603_16_ITEM8_P117_S2	The interest rates applicable to loans under the Credit Facility are generally based on Eurodollar, Federal Funds or prime rates plus applicable margins as defined in the agreement.
714603_16_ITEM8_P117_S3	The Credit Facility contains grid schedules that adjust borrowing costs up or down based upon our consolidated leverage ratio.
714603_16_ITEM8_P117_S4	The grid schedules may result in fluctuations in borrowing costs ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% over Eurodollar and 0.00% to 0.70% over base rate , as defined.
714603_16_ITEM8_P117_S5	Additionally, we pay an annual facility fee of 0.125% to 0.30% .
714603_16_ITEM8_P117_S6	Among other provisions, the Credit Facility requires certain leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	If any event of default occurs and is continuing, all amounts payable under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable.
714603_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	The Credit Facility also contains customary restrictive covenants and cross-default provisions.
714603_16_ITEM8_P118_S2	The maturity date for the Credit Facility is October 1, 2019.
714603_16_ITEM8_P118_S3	Amounts borrowed on the Credit Facility were $226.1 million and $44.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P118_S4	We also maintain a margin credit facility with a regulated broker/dealer which is collateralized by the underlying marketable securities and have various other unsecured revolving lines of credit to support our consolidated subsidiaries operations that provide total borrowings of up to $30.0 million .
714603_16_ITEM8_P118_S5	Borrowings on these lines of credit are available at variable rates of interest based on the LIBOR or the bank s Prime rate and mature during 2016.
714603_16_ITEM8_P118_S6	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no borrowings under any of these lines of credit.
714603_16_ITEM8_P118_S7	During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , total proceeds from our revolving credit facilities were approximately $1,053.6 million , $929.8 million and $1,032.3 million , respectively, and total repayments were approximately $871.8 million , $895.9 million and $1,160.0 million respectively, which comprise the net cash flows presented within the financing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	Senior notes During 2010, we issued $370.0 million of aggregate principal of privately placed senior notes (collectively, the Senior Notes ) pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated August 9, 2010 (the "Agreement").
714603_16_ITEM8_P119_S1	The Senior Notes are comprised of $40.0 million of 4.19% Series A Senior Notes due August 9, 2015, $105.0 million of 4.86% Series B Senior Notes due August 9, 2017, $65.0 million of 5.06% Series C Senior Notes due August 9, 2018 and $160.0 million of 5.42% Series D Senior Notes due August 9, 2020.
714603_16_ITEM8_P119_S2	We repaid the Series A Senior Notes at maturity during 2015.
714603_16_ITEM8_P119_S3	Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in February and August of each year.
714603_16_ITEM8_P119_S4	We may prepay the Senior Notes at any time, in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole prepayment premium.
714603_16_ITEM8_P119_S5	Pursuant to the Agreement, any Company subsidiary required to become a party to or otherwise guarantee the syndicated line of credit facility or other indebtedness in excess of $100.0 million , must also guarantee our obligations under the Senior Notes.
714603_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	The Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants, as well as certain customary events of default, including cross-default provisions.
714603_16_ITEM8_P120_S1	Among other provisions, the Agreement limits our ability to incur or create liens, sell assets, issue priority indebtedness and change lines of business.
714603_16_ITEM8_P120_S2	The Agreement also requires certain leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	Related party credit agreements We acquired certain intangible assets in 2011 from BFDS in exchange for an installment loan that is payable over five years and matures in September 2016.
714603_16_ITEM8_P121_S1	The amounts outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $1.5 million and $3.7 million , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P121_S2	Other indebtedness We have other indebtedness of $4.5 million and $14.9 million outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, which is primarily comprised of debt assumed in a 2006 business acquisition and a secured promissory note payable.
714603_16_ITEM8_P121_S3	The debt assumed had outstanding balances at December 31, 2015 and 2014 of $3.4 million and $7.0 million , respectively, and is payable in monthly installments with a fixed interest rate of 5.6% .
714603_16_ITEM8_P121_S4	The maturity date of this indebtedness is September 2016.
714603_16_ITEM8_P121_S5	The secured promissory note payable was repaid and the related interest rate swap was terminated during 2015.
714603_16_ITEM8_P121_S6	At December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance under this note payable was $6.1 million .
714603_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	Future principal payments of indebtedness at December 31, 2015 are as follows (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	The weighted average interest rates on our short-term borrowings were 1.67% and 1.86% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P123_S1	Based upon the borrowing rates currently available to us for indebtedness with similar terms and average maturities, the carrying value of long-term debt, with the exception of the Senior Notes, is considered to approximate fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM8_P123_S2	The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes was derived principally from quoted prices (level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).
714603_16_ITEM8_P123_S3	The carrying and fair value of the Senior Notes were as follows (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions.
714603_16_ITEM8_P124_S1	When determined appropriate, we use derivative instruments as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks.
714603_16_ITEM8_P124_S2	The primary market risks managed by us through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk.
714603_16_ITEM8_P124_S3	We may use various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts, option contracts and swaps.
714603_16_ITEM8_P124_S4	We do not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes.
714603_16_ITEM8_P124_S5	We determine the fair values of our derivatives based on quoted market prices that are directly or indirectly observable as further described within Note 6 , Fair Value Measurements .
714603_16_ITEM8_P124_S6	The fair value of our derivative instruments is reflected on a gross, rather than net, basis and is not significant to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 or 2014.
714603_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	Cash flow hedging strategy We use cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.
714603_16_ITEM8_P125_S1	The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) and are reclassified into the line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.
714603_16_ITEM8_P125_S2	The changes in fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings.
714603_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	The length of time for which we hedge our exposure to future cash flows is typically one to two years.
714603_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	We have entered into a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our net cash outflows from intercompany purchases of services from our international subsidiaries could be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
714603_16_ITEM8_P127_S1	We entered into forward foreign currency contracts (Thai baht) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies.
714603_16_ITEM8_P127_S2	The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for our foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $13.5 million and $14.0 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	We monitor the mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly.
714603_16_ITEM8_P128_S1	From time to time, we manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments.
714603_16_ITEM8_P128_S2	We have entered into interest rate swap agreements and have designated these instruments as part of our interest rate cash flow hedging program.
714603_16_ITEM8_P128_S3	The objective of this hedging program is to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in benchmark interest rates on our future interest payments.
714603_16_ITEM8_P128_S4	The total notional value of these interest rate swap agreements that were designated and qualified for our interest rate cash flow hedging program was $6.1 million as of December 31, 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM8_P128_S5	There were none at December 31, 2015 .
714603_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	The pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on AOCI and earnings was not significant during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .
714603_16_ITEM8_P129_S1	There were no gains or losses recognized into income as a result of hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .
714603_16_ITEM8_P129_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , we estimate that amounts to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months are $0.2 million .
714603_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	In addition to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, we also use certain derivatives as economic hedges of foreign currency exposure.
714603_16_ITEM8_P130_S1	Although these derivatives were not designated for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges.
714603_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	The changes in fair values of economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.
714603_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	We use foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on certain intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies, primarily the British pound and Australian dollar.
714603_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	The foreign currency economic hedging program consists of rolling, monthly forward foreign currency contracts which settle on the last day of each month.
714603_16_ITEM8_P133_S1	As a result, there are minimal unrealized gains or losses at the end of the period related to these contracts.
714603_16_ITEM8_P133_S2	The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency economic hedges were $125.4 million and $85.1 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse.
714603_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	Deferred tax expense (benefit) is generally the result of changes in the assets or liabilities for deferred taxes.
714603_16_ITEM8_P135_S1	The following summarizes pretax income (loss) (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM8_P136_S0	Provision for income taxes (benefits) consists of the following components (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM8_P137_S0	Following are the reconciliations of our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal income tax statutory rate (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	The federal and state deferred tax assets (liabilities) recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM8_P139_S0	We have approximately $17.3 million of federal net operating losses as of December 31, 2015 as a result of current year business combinations.
714603_16_ITEM8_P139_S1	These net operating losses begin to expire in 2022 and are available to reduce future income taxes.
714603_16_ITEM8_P139_S2	Since these net operating losses were generated by an entity prior to its acquisition by DST, our utilization is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
714603_16_ITEM8_P139_S3	We do not anticipate that such limitations will prohibit the utilization of the federal net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration.
714603_16_ITEM8_P139_S4	We have approximately $55.2 million of state net operating losses as of December 31, 2015.
714603_16_ITEM8_P139_S5	These net operating losses begin to expire in 2023.
714603_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	We have approximately $7.5 million and $22.2 million of net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2015 in Canada and the U.K., respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P140_S1	The Canada carryforwards begin to expire in 2028.
714603_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	The U.K. carryforwards do not expire but their utilization may be limited to offset only income with certain characteristics.
714603_16_ITEM8_P142_S0	A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
714603_16_ITEM8_P142_S1	In evaluating the realizability of certain international net deferred tax assets, we also anticipate that limitations may result in the benefit of these amounts not being realized and have established corresponding valuation allowances as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 of $15.7 million and $20.8 million , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	We provide deferred taxes for unremitted earnings of U.S. unconsolidated affiliates net of the 80% dividends received deduction provided for under current tax law.
714603_16_ITEM8_P143_S1	Through December 31, 2015 , the cumulative amount of such unremitted earnings was $83.5 million .
714603_16_ITEM8_P143_S2	These amounts would become taxable to us if distributed by the affiliates as dividends, in which case we would be entitled to the dividends received deduction for 80% of the dividends; alternatively, these earnings could be realized by the sale of the affiliates stock, which would give rise to tax at federal capital gains rates and state ordinary income tax rates, to the extent the stock sale proceeds exceeded our tax basis.
714603_16_ITEM8_P143_S3	Deferred taxes provided on unremitted earnings through December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $6.0 million and $5.6 million , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S0	We record U.S. tax on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S1	During fourth quarter 2013, we assessed the forecasted cash needs and the overall financial position of our foreign subsidiaries and determined that a portion of previously permanently reinvested earnings would no longer be reinvested overseas.
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S2	As a result, during 2013 we made distributions from and/or reversed our permanently reinvested assertions with respect to our Thailand, Mauritius and South Africa subsidiaries, as well as issued a one-time dividend from one of our Canadian subsidiaries.
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S3	These 2013 distributions resulted in incremental U.S. tax of $7.5 million .
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S4	Distributions in 2014 and 2015 resulted in incremental taxes of $0.7 million and $1.9 million , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S5	We recorded approximately $2.7 million and $2.5 million of related income tax liability, net of credits, on unremitted earnings in 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S6	We intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings in the businesses of our other foreign subsidiaries.
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S7	As a consequence, no federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided for amounts which would become payable, if any, on the distribution of such earnings.
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S8	In the event of such a distribution, we may be able to offset, at least in part, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such a distribution with foreign income tax credits which would become creditable as a result of such a distribution.
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S9	Due to the uncertainty of the manner in which the undistributed earnings would be brought back to the U.S., the tax laws in effect at that time, as well as the ability of the Company to claim foreign tax credits, it is not practicable for us to determine the income tax we would incur, if any, if such earnings were distributed.
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S10	As of December 31, 2015 , accumulated undistributed earnings considered permanently reinvested were $31.4 million .
714603_16_ITEM8_P144_S11	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM8_P145_S0	Included in the net unrecognized tax benefit at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $42.0 million , $51.8 million and $74.7 million , respectively, of tax positions which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
714603_16_ITEM8_P145_S1	We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes, which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods.
714603_16_ITEM8_P145_S2	The liability for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits increased $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $11.5 million .
714603_16_ITEM8_P145_S3	The liability for interest and penalties decreased $7.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM8_P145_S4	Although it is difficult to predict when all uncertain tax positions will reverse due to the unknown timing of the completion of examination periods, it is possible that aggregate income tax amounts of approximately $19.0 million to $21.0 million may reverse during 2016.
714603_16_ITEM8_P146_S0	We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
714603_16_ITEM8_P146_S1	An Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) examination for the tax years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009 was completed in April 2013.
714603_16_ITEM8_P146_S2	An IRS examination for the tax year ended December 31, 2010 was completed in September 2015.
714603_16_ITEM8_P146_S3	Federal tax years 2011 through 2015 are subject to examination while various years from 1999 through 2015 are under or are subject to various state, local, and foreign income tax examinations by taxing authorities.
714603_16_ITEM8_P147_S0	We do not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on our financial statements.
714603_16_ITEM8_P148_S0	During 2013, the IRS completed its examination of the previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions and research and experimentation credits for the periods 2006 through 2009.
714603_16_ITEM8_P148_S1	As a result, during 2013 we recognized income tax benefits of $16.1 million , resulting from the reversal of previously reserved tax positions related to these matters as well as other remeasurements during the period.
714603_16_ITEM8_P149_S0	During 2015, the IRS completed its examination of the previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions, research and experimentation credits and capital losses for the period 2010.
714603_16_ITEM8_P149_S1	As a result, during 2015 we recognized income tax benefits of $11.9 million , resulting from the reversal of previously reserved tax positions related to these matters as well as other remeasurements during the period.
714603_16_ITEM8_P150_S0	Equity Earnings per share The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):
714603_16_ITEM8_P151_S0	We had approximately 34.3 million and 37.6 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_16_ITEM8_P151_S1	There were no shares from options to purchase common stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
714603_16_ITEM8_P152_S0	We have authorized 10.0 million shares of preferred stock, of which no shares are currently issued or outstanding.
714603_16_ITEM8_P152_S1	Accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) balances, net of tax consist of the following (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM8_P153_S0	Additions to and reclassifications out of AOCI attributable to the Company (in millions):
714603_16_ITEM8_P154_S0	(1) Realized (gains)/losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized in Other income, net.

714603_16_ITEM8_P162_S2	Except for restrictions placed on the transferability of the restricted stock, holders of RSAs have full stockholders rights during the term of restriction, including voting rights and the right to receive cash dividends, if any.
714603_16_ITEM8_P162_S3	Grants of RSUs do not confer full stockholder rights such as voting rights and cash dividends, but provide for additional dividend equivalent RSU awards in lieu of cash dividends.
714603_16_ITEM8_P163_S0	Unvested shares of restricted stock may be forfeited upon termination of employment with the Company depending on the circumstances of the termination, or failure to achieve the required performance condition, if applicable.

( BFDS ), our domestic joint venture with State Street Corporation ( State Street ), utilizing our proprietary software applications, including our TA 2000 and TRAC systems.

714603_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts, participants or transactions processed.
714603_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	For subaccounts, broker/dealers provide a portion of the services directly.
714603_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	As a result, our revenue per account is generally higher for registered accounts than for subaccounts.
714603_17_ITEM1_P7_S3	On a more limited basis, we also generate revenue through asset-based fee arrangements, subscriptions and/or seat licensing and from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in our full service transfer agency bank accounts.

714603_17_ITEM1_P7_S6	Collectively, these joint ventures accounted for approximately 12.4% of the segment s operating revenues in 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Sources of new business for the Financial Services segment include: (i) existing clients, particularly with respect to complementary and new products and services, (ii) companies relying on their own in-house capabilities and not using outside vendors, (iii) companies using competitors systems, and (iv) new entrants into the markets served by Financial Services.
714603_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	We consider our existing client base to be one of our best sources of new business.
714603_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	We believe that competition in the markets in which the Financial Services segment operates is based largely on price, quality of service, features offered, the ability to handle rapidly changing volumes, response to security and compliance needs, product innovation, and responsiveness.
714603_17_ITEM1_P8_S3	Our competitors are primarily financial institutions and in-house systems.
714603_17_ITEM1_P8_S4	Our financial institution competitors may have an advantage because they can take into consideration the value of their clients funds on deposit or under management when pricing their services.
714603_17_ITEM1_P8_S5	We believe there is significant competition in our markets and our ability to compete effectively is dependent in part on access to capital.
714603_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Healthcare Services segment uses our proprietary software applications to provide healthcare organizations with pharmacy, healthcare administration, and health outcomes optimization solutions to satisfy their information processing, quality of care, cost management and payment integrity needs.

714603_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	Effective January 2017, two of our Healthcare Services customers began transitioning off of our systems, which is expected to result in lower overall segment revenue growth during 2017 as compared to 2016.

714603_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Customers primarily consist of managed care organizations, preferred provider organizations, third-party administrators, dental, vision, and behavioral health organizations operating commercial and government sponsored programs such as the Health Insurance Exchanges that operate under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid.
714603_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	We compete with other third-party providers and companies that perform their services in-house with licensed or internally developed systems and processes.
714603_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe that we compete effectively in the market due to our ongoing investment in our products and the development of new products to meet the evolving business requirements of our customers.
714603_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our competitors healthcare administration and health outcomes optimization solutions are primarily based on complete replacement of a payer s core system.
714603_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	We believe that a component application approach shifts the focus away from core application replacement to one in which clients have more alternatives for modernization of the business operation.
714603_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	With a component approach, health payer clients can still choose core application replacement if warranted, or adopt component applications that address only those areas of the business that offer the most opportunity of improvement for the customer, resulting in protection of the client s current IT investment and reduced disruption to its business operation.
714603_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	We use our proprietary software applications, supporting technology and enhanced clinical expertise to provide pharmacy health management solutions supporting commercial, Medicaid and Medicare Part D plans.

714603_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	The duration of the patent term is generally 20 years from its earliest application filing date.
714603_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	The patent term is not renewable.
714603_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	The durations of the copyrights depend on a number of factors, such as who created the work and whether he or she was employed by us at the time.
714603_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	The trademark rights generally will continue for as long as we maintain usage of the trademarks.

714603_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Trends or events affecting our clients or their industries could decrease the demand for our products and services and the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our significant customers could materially harm our business and results of operations.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We derive our revenues from the delivery of products and services to clients primarily in the mutual fund, brokerage, investment management, healthcare, and other financial service (e.g., insurance, banking and financial planning) industries.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Demand for our products and services among companies in those industries could decline for many reasons.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If demand for our products decreases or any of the industries we serve decline or fail or consolidate, reducing the number of potential clients, our business and our operating results could be adversely affected.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	On a consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2016 , our five largest customers (excluding BFDS and IFDS, our 50%-owned joint ventures with State Street) accounted for approximately 22.0% of our consolidated operating revenues.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	For the same period, the Healthcare Services segment s five largest customers accounted for approximately 51.4% of our revenue in that segment, including 17.8% from its largest customer.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Because of our significant customer concentration, particularly in the Healthcare Services segment, our revenue could fluctuate significantly due to changes in economic conditions, the use of competitive products, or the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our significant customers, and a delay or default in payment by any significant customer could materially harm our business and results of operations.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Events that adversely affect our clients businesses, rates of growth or numbers of customers they serve could decrease demand for our products and services and the number of transactions we process.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Events that could adversely affect our clients businesses include decreased demand for our customers products and services, adverse conditions in our customers markets or adverse economic conditions generally.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P1_S8	We may be unsuccessful in predicting the needs of changing industries and whether potential customers will accept our products or services.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P1_S9	We also may invest in technology or infrastructure for specific customers and not realize additional revenue from such investments.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P1_S10	If trends or events do not occur as we expect, our business could be negatively impacted.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems could result in significant costs and reputational damage.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have developed and maintained, and our businesses depend on, information technology, including elements both internal and external, to record and process a large volume of complex transactions and other data, including personally identifiable information regarding financial and health matters.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In certain circumstances, vendors have access to such data in order to assist us with responsibilities, such as producing benefit plan identification cards, maintaining software we license on our own behalf or resell to others, or helping clients comply with anti-money laundering regulations.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Any interruptions, delays, breakdowns, or breach, including as a result of cybersecurity breaches or breaches of our environments and procedures or those of our vendors, could result in significant data losses or theft of our or our customers intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In recent years, several health care and financial services firms were victims of computer systems hacking attacks, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data, and reputational harm.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Rapid advances in technology, and the limits and costs of technology, skills and manpower, may prevent us from anticipating, identifying, preventing or addressing all potential security threats and breaches.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues, regulatory penalties, and litigation.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The demand for our products and services could decrease if we do not continually address our clients technology and capacity requirements.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our clients use technology-based products and services in the complex and rapidly changing markets in which they operate.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We may not have effective and efficient processes to support the design, set-up, quality assurance, and maintenance activities for the timely implementation of new client services, migration of existing clients onto new or different platforms, and ongoing servicing that meets the needs of the business and clients.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We must substantially invest in technology and systems to meet customer requirements for technology and capacity.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we do not meet clients technology and capacity requirements in advance of our competitors or if the investments we make are not cost-effective or do not result in successful products or services, our business could be adversely affected.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The success of the information technology transformation initiative will depend on the timing, extent and cost of implementation; performance of third-parties; upgrade requirements; and availability and reliability of the various technologies required to provide such transformation.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We must continually invest in our information technology in order to continually meet our clients needs.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We are implementing a multi-year information technology transformation initiative intended to reduce operating costs, increase information security, upgrade infrastructure, implement automation, provide access to emerging technologies and position us to take advantage of market opportunities.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If we fail to provide an enhanced client experience, our ability to retain and attract clients and to maintain and grow revenues could be adversely affected.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Using new and sophisticated technology on a very large scale entails risks.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	For example, deployment of new software may adversely affect the performance of existing services on our existing platforms and decrease the customer experience.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If implementation of our information technology transformation initiative were delayed or costs exceed expected amounts, our margins could be adversely affected and such effects could be material.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If the delivery of services expected to be deployed on modernized architecture were delayed due to technological constraints, performance of third-party suppliers, or other reasons, the cost of providing such services could become higher than expected, which could result in higher costs to clients, potentially resulting in decisions to purchase services from our competitors, which would adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flow from operations.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our business strategy anticipates that we will supplement internal growth by pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We may be unable to identify suitable businesses to acquire.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other complementary businesses.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Information we obtain about an acquisition target may be limited and there can be no assurance that an acquisition will perform as expected or positively impact our financial performance.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Potential acquisitions involve risk, including the risk we would be unable to effectively integrate the acquired technologies, operations and personnel into our business, and the risk that management s attention and our capital would be diverted from other areas of our business.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P12_S6	The anticipated benefits of our acquisitions may not materialize.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the issuance of capital stock, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P12_S8	If we cannot complete acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In addition, we have divested, and may in the future divest, businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt our business, distract management from other responsibilities and may result in continued responsibility for the divested business, including through indemnification, for a period of time following the transaction, which could adversely affect our financial results.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If our new investments and business initiatives are not successful, our financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We are investing heavily in our technology to improve existing products and services and add new products and services to address the needs of existing or new clients.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our investments may not lead to successful deployment or increases in the number of accounts or transactions.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	If we are not successful in creating value from our investments by increasing sales or reducing expenses, our financial condition and prospects could be harmed.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P13_S6	An increase in subaccounting services performed by brokerage firms has and will continue to adversely impact our revenues.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We service open-end and closed-end funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, interval funds and exchange-listed closed-end funds, as well as private funds, collective investment trusts and other accounts under shareowner recordkeeping arrangements which we refer to as registered accounts.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These arrangements are distinguished from broker subaccounts, which are serviced under contract with a broker/dealer.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our clients may adopt the broker subaccount structure.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	We offer subaccounting services to brokerage firms that perform shareowner subaccounting.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	As the recordkeeping functions in connection with subaccounting are more limited than traditional shareowner accounting, the fees charged are generally lower on a per unit basis.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Brokerage firms that obtain agreements from our clients to use a broker subaccount structure cause accounts currently on our traditional recordkeeping system to convert to our subaccounting system, or to the subaccounting systems of other service providers, which generally results in lower revenues.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S6	While subaccounting conversions have generally been limited to our non tax-advantaged mutual fund accounts, such conversions have begun to extend to the tax-advantaged accounts (such as retirement and Section 529 accounts) we service, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Consolidation in or among our customers and potential customers could result in a reduction of customers or reduction in use of our services.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Mergers or acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers or between our customers and other entities could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers and result in the discontinuation or reduction in use of our services.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S9	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Our businesses are subject to substantial competition.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S12	We are subject to intense competition from other established service providers in all industries we serve.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Some of our competitors are able to bundle service offerings and offer more appealing pricing structures.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S14	Some of our clients, or the clients they serve, may develop, have developed or are developing the in-house capacity to perform the transaction processing and recordkeeping services they have paid us to perform.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S15	Additionally, some of our competitors and clients have greater financial and human resources and access to capital than we do.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S16	In the financial and healthcare markets we serve, we compete based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the range of products offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, stability and continuity of client and other intermediary relationships, quality of service, and level of fees charged for services.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S17	We continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products and services offered.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S18	Our failure to successfully compete in any of our material operating businesses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P14_S19	Competition could also affect the revenue mix of services we provide, resulting in decreased revenues in lines of business with higher profit margins.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may not be able to sustain critical operations and provide essential products and services during system failures or catastrophic events.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Damage to our facilities could impact our operations or financial condition.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The performance of our services also depends upon facilities that house central computer operations or operating centers.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Significant damage to any of our operating facilities could interrupt the operations at those facilities and interfere with our ability to serve customers.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Moreover, in the event of a catastropic event we may not be able to execute our business resumption strategies for data processing and capabilities, and we may not have the ability to recover critical data, programs, applications, and data processing capabilities in a timely manner; any of these could impact our ability to serve our clients.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We operate internationally and are thus exposed to currency fluctuations and foreign political, economic and other conditions that could adversely affect our revenues from or support by foreign operations.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Inherent risks in our international business activities could decrease our international sales and also could adversely affect our ability to receive important support from our international operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	These risks include potentially unfavorable foreign economic conditions, political conditions or national priorities, foreign government regulation, potential expropriation of assets by foreign governments, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, the failure to bridge cultural differences, and limited or prohibited access to our foreign operations and the support they provide.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We may also have difficulty repatriating any profits or be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in our international business.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Various events may cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The nature of these events might inhibit our ability to anticipate and act in advance to counter them.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We may be unsuccessful in determining or controlling when and whether events occur that could cause varying financial results.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Unfavorable results may occur that we did not anticipate or take advance action to address.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We incur significant costs to develop products used to service our existing and potential client operations.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	The timing of these expenses may fluctuate as new client contracts are signed or existing client contracts are renewed, causing our results to vary accordingly.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Factors contributing to the variability of our results include increased costs of supplies, increased costs relating to existing and potential client operations, and hiring staff to develop new and existing products.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P16_S7	The timing of our fees associated with new and existing client contracts, including changes in recognition as a result of changes in accounting principles, may also cause results to vary from period to period.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn for our services.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets, which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets, among other factors.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We could continue to be negatively impacted by the volatile markets as certain of our fees are tied to the asset bases of our clients.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The occurrence of significant market volatility or decreased levels of participation would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Additionally, we may be exposed to operational or other risks in connection with any systematic failures in the markets, or the default due to market-related failures of one or more counterparties with whom we transact.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We also derive significant revenues from asset management, administration and distribution contracts with clients.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Under these contracts, the fees paid to us are based on a variety of factors, including the market value of assets under management ( AUM ), assets under administration ( AUA ) and number of transactions processed.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	AUM, AUA or the number of transactions processed may decline for various reasons, causing results to vary.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Factors that could decrease AUM and AUA (and therefore revenues) include declines in the market value of the assets in the funds (and accounts as applicable) managed, administered and distributed, redemptions and other withdrawals from, or shifts among, the funds (and accounts as applicable) managed, administered and distributed, as well as market conditions generally.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Our revenues may decrease due to changes in asset management, administration and distribution fees and industry trends The asset management, administration and distribution business is highly competitive and we compete for investors and clients on the basis of factors such as performance, reputation, service, and cost.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Underperformance of any of our proprietary and client products, damage to our reputation, or service-related issues could lead to redemptions or terminations.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Additionally, the asset management industry has generally been subject to fee compression and asset flows to lower cost products.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Such a trend may result in fee compression in asset management, administration and distribution related contracts.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	certain funds may terminate investment management, administration and distribution agreements for any reason and without penalty.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The factors and trends described above could have a material adverse effect on revenues.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Investment decisions with respect to cash balances, market returns or losses on investments, and limits on insurance applicable to cash balances held in bank and brokerage accounts, including those held by us and as agent on behalf of our clients, could expose us to losses of such cash balances and adversely affect revenues attributable to cash balance deposit investments.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	As part of our transaction processing and other services, we maintain and manage large bank and investment accounts containing client funds, which we hold as agent, as well as operational funds.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our revenues include investment earnings related to client fund cash balances.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our choices in selecting investments, or market conditions that affect the rate of return on or the availability of investments, could have an adverse effect on the level of such revenues.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The amounts held in our operational and client deposit accounts could exceed the limits of government insurance programs of organizations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation, exposing us to the risk of loss.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Any substantial loss would have an adverse impact on our business and our financial condition.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Operational errors in the performance of our services or contractual obligations, as well as unknown or undetected defects, could lead to liability for claims, client loss and result in reputational damage.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The failure to properly perform our services or contractual obligations could result in our clients and/or certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to losses including censures, fines, or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Despite testing, defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services, which could cause us to compromise customer data, lose revenues, lose clients, divert development resources, or damage our reputation, any of which could harm our business.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Our revenues could decrease if client contracts are terminated or fail to renew or if clients renegotiate contracts or utilize our services at lower than anticipated levels.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We derive most of our revenue by selling products and services under long-term contracts, many of which contain terms and conditions based on anticipated levels of utilization of our services.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We cannot unilaterally extend the terms of our client contracts when they expire.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Contracts can terminate during the term of agreement for various reasons, including through termination for convenience clauses in some contracts that enable clients to cancel by written notice.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our revenues could decrease as a result of terminations or non-renewals of client contracts; extensions of client contracts under, or contract re-negotiations resulting in, less favorable terms; or utilization of services at less than anticipated levels.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We are substantially dependent on our intellectual property rights, and a claim for infringement or a requirement to indemnify a client for infringement could adversely affect us.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	We have made substantial investments in software and other intellectual property on which our business is highly dependent.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Businesses we acquire also often depend on intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and, ultimately, our business.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the U.S. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S9	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S10	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S11	To the extent available, we rely on patent, trade secret and copyright laws; however, significant portions of our proprietary intellectual property is not protected by patents.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S12	We also utilize nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and security measures to protect our proprietary technology.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S13	We cannot guarantee these measures will be effective.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S14	Our products and services rely on technology developed by others, including open source software, and we have no control over possible infringement of someone else s intellectual property rights by the provider of this technology.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S15	The owner of the rights could seek damages from us rather than or in addition to the persons who provide the technology to us.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S16	We could be subject at any time to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to evaluate and defend.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S17	Our clients may also face infringement claims, allege that such claims relate to our products and services, and seek indemnification from us.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P23_S18	Any loss of our intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights of others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our investments in funds and other companies could decline in value.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We hold significant investments in available-for-sale equity securities of other companies, primarily State Street Corporation, and other financial interests that are subject to fluctuations in market prices.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	A significant decline in the value of our equity investments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We may not always be able to sell those investments at higher prices than we paid for them or than the value of the consideration used to acquire them.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	From time to time we add new investment strategies to our investment product offerings by providing the initial cash investments as seed capital.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The seed capital investments may decline in value.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	A significant decline in their value could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are a limited partner in various private equity funds and have future capital commitments related to certain private equity fund investments.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Generally, private equity fund securities are non-transferable or are subject to long holding periods, and withdrawals from the private equity firm partnerships are typically not permitted.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Even when transfer restrictions do not apply, there is generally no public market for the securities.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Therefore, we may not be able to sell the securities at a time when we desire to do so.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We may not always be able to sell those investments at the same or higher prices than we paid for them.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	We also participate in joint ventures with other companies.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	These joint venture investments could require further capital contributions.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We have restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	If we do not comply with these restrictive covenants, our failure could result in material and adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary investments, and asset dispositions, and require us to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in reduced liquidity for the Company and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our debt agreements could result in a cross default under one or more of our other debt agreements, including our financing agreements.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S5	This would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operation.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Regulatory and Litigation Risks We and our unconsolidated affiliates are subject to regulation.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Any regulatory violations, changes or uncertainties could adversely affect our business.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S8	A number of our businesses are subject to U.S. or foreign regulation, including privacy, licensing, processing, recordkeeping, investment adviser, broker/dealer, retirement, reporting and related regulations.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S9	New products and services we plan to offer may also be subject to regulation, either directly or as a downstream provider to customers or clients.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S10	Such regulations cover all aspects of our businesses including, but not limited to, sales and trading methods, trade practices among broker/dealers, use and safekeeping of customers funds and securities, capital structure of securities firms, net capital, anti-money laundering efforts, healthcare, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S11	Any violation of applicable regulations could expose us or those businesses to civil or criminal liability, significant fines or sanctions, damage our reputation, the revocation of licenses, censures, or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, which could adversely affect our business or our financial results.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S12	Governmental changes, changing interpretation of regulations, and uncertainties surrounding services we provide could increase our costs of business, result in penalties, or diminish business, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S13	The SEC or other regulatory agencies may issue regulations impacting mutual fund service providers, which could adversely affect our business.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S14	The Department of Labor ( DOL ) recently issued fiduciary regulations that, if not delayed, repealed or substantially altered in the near future, are likely to impact our business.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S15	The SEC or other regulatory agencies may issue regulations impacting third-party service providers of mutual funds and other fund-types products, such as distributors, administrators, or custodians, (collectively referred to as mutual funds ), which could adversely affect our business.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S16	The SEC may issue additional regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Dodd-Frank Act ) or other legislative authority that would require brokers and financial intermediaries that distribute mutual funds to make more detailed fee disclosures at the point-of-sale.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S17	Additionally, brokers and financial intermediaries may become, in some instances, subject to a new DOL-imposed fiduciary standard-of-care that, if applicable, could cause them to alter their methods of distribution, share class structure, and/or wholesaling activities.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S18	It is not yet clear what impact they may have on such activities.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P27_S19	It is also unclear whether the regulations will be delayed, repealed or substantially altered in the near future.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We cannot predict all of the requirements the SEC or FINRA may impose.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	accounts on our systems as a result of changes in client offerings or the attractiveness of offerings to customers of our clients.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The biggest impact of the fiduciary regulations is expected to fall on brokers and registered investment advisers who give individualized non-discretionary advice in the retail marketplace, but discretionary investment managers in the institutional space are also expected to be affected, primarily in connection with sales of investment products and services.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	To the extent that our business units, clients, unaffiliated intermediary partners and retirement plan service providers fit into these categories, this could adversely affect our business and operating results.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Additionally, to the extent the Dodd- Frank Act and/or DOL regulations impact the operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business, those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs, reduce their capacity to transact, or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our clients are subject to regulation that could affect our business.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our clients are subject to extensive regulation, including investment adviser, broker/dealer and privacy regulations applicable to services we provide to the financial services industry and insurance, privacy and other regulations applicable to services we provide to the healthcare industry.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Changes in, and any violation by our clients of, applicable laws and regulations (whether related to the services we provide or otherwise) could diminish their business or financial condition and thus their demand for our products and services or could increase our cost of continuing to provide services to such industries.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Demand could also decrease if we do not continue to offer products and services that help our clients comply with regulations.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	For example, our accounts in our Healthcare Services segment are impacted by the Affordable Care Act, including the Health Insurance Marketplace.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Changes to the Affordable Care Act may be enacted by Congress in response to the new administration s stated agenda, and we cannot predict the impact that will have on our customers and their demand for our services.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Our businesses expose us to risks of claims and losses that could be significant and damage our reputation and business prospects.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Our proprietary applications and related consulting and other services include the processing or clearing of financial and healthcare transactions for our clients and their customers and the design of benefit plans and compliance programs.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S8	The dollar amount of transactions processed or cleared is vastly higher than the revenues we derive from providing these services.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S9	In the event we make transaction processing or operational errors, or mismanage any process, we could be exposed to claims for any resulting processing delays, disclosure of protected information, miscalculations, mishandling of pass-through disbursements or other processes, and failure to follow a client s instructions or meet specifications.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S10	Additionally, we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from a failure of third parties (including regulatory authorities) to recognize the limitations of our role as our clients agent or consultant, and we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from fraud committed by third parties.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S11	We may be exposed to the risk of counterparty breaches or failure to perform.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S12	We may be subject to claims, including class actions, for reimbursements, losses or damages arising from any transaction processing or operational error, or from process mismanagement.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P31_S13	Because of the sensitive nature of the financial and healthcare transactions we process, our liability and any alleged damages may significantly exceed the fees we receive for performing the service at issue.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Litigation could include class action claims based upon, among other theories, various regulatory requirements and consumer protection and privacy laws that class action plaintiffs may attempt to use to assert private rights of action.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Any of these claims and related settlements or judgments could affect our operating results, damage our reputation, decrease demand for our services, or cause us to make costly operating changes.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We do not control certain businesses in which we have significant ownership.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We invest in joint ventures and other unconsolidated affiliates as part of our business strategy, and part of our net income is derived from our pro rata share of the earnings of those businesses.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Despite owning significant equity interests in those companies and having directors on their boards, we do not control their operations, strategies or financial decisions.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The other owners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the businesses we co-own.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Our pro rata share of any losses due to unfavorable performance of those companies could negatively impact our financial results.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Some of our joint venture investments are subject to buy-sell agreements, which could, among other things, restrict us from selling our interests even if we were to determine it would be prudent to do so.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We own interests in unconsolidated entities, including Boston Financial Data Services, International Financial Data Services Limited Partnership, International Financial Data Services Limited, and various real estate joint ventures.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our interests in such unconsolidated entities are subject to buy/sell arrangements, which could restrict our ability to sell our interests even if we were to determine it would be prudent to do so.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	These arrangements could also allow us to purchase the other owners interests to prevent someone else from acquiring them and we cannot control the timing of occasions to do so.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	The businesses or other owners may encourage us to increase our investment in or make contributions to the businesses at an inopportune time.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Various plans, agreements, laws and organizational documents may have anti-takeover effects.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, certain plans and agreements, and applicable laws could make it more difficult for a party to make a tender offer for our shares or complete a takeover that is not approved by our Board of Directors.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	legal restrictions on business combinations with certain stockholders.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Because of contractual commitments, a change in control could affect our operating results and weaken our management retention and incentive tools.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	A change in control of the Company could trigger various rights and obligations in service agreements with certain customers and in agreements governing our joint ventures.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	A change in control could also allow some clients to terminate their agreements with us or to obtain rights to use our processing software.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We are parties to joint venture agreements that allow other co-owners to buy our equity interests if we undergo a change in control.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Under certain executive equity-based and other incentive compensation awards, benefit programs and employment agreements with our management, a change in control by itself, or an individual s termination of employment without cause or resignation for good reason (each as defined in applicable agreements) after a change in control could accelerate funding, payment or vesting of equity grants, as applicable, under such agreements and programs.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	This accelerated funding, vesting or payment may decrease an employee s incentive to continue employment with us.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We have adopted an executive severance plan which, among other things, provides benefits to participating senior officers and executives who are terminated in connection with a change of control.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Certain other executive officers have agreements with us that require us to continue to employ them for three years after a change in control or to pay certain amounts if we terminate their employment without cause or they resign for good reason following a change in control.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P38_S5	The executives might not be incented to achieve desired results for the new owners of our business, and the cost of keeping the executives on the payroll might deter potential new owners from acquiring us or hinder new owners from hiring replacement management.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P38_S6	We may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P38_S7	Future cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
714603_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Payment of dividends is subject to applicable laws and to restrictions in applicable debt agreements.
714603_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	production space in the United Kingdom for operations that are included within our discontinued operations.
714603_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also own undeveloped land in Kansas City, Missouri and California and an underground facility with approximately 538,000 square feet in Kansas City, Missouri, of which 497,000 square feet is leased to third parties.
714603_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our real estate joint ventures own 2.7 million square feet of real estate, of which 2.2 million square feet is occupied by third parties or is vacant.
714603_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	We believe our facilities are currently adequate for their intended purposes and are adequately maintained.

714603_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	We have entered and may enter into one or more plans with our brokers or banks for pre-authorized purchases within defined limits pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 to affect all or a portion of such share repurchases.

714603_17_ITEM6_P0_S4	In 2014, we recorded a pretax gain of $100.5 million on the sale of the wholly-owned subsidiary, DST Global Solutions, Ltd., which is included in Gain on sale of business in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_17_ITEM6_P0_S5	In addition, we recorded net gains on securities and other investments of $343.5 million, which were included in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

714603_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	(7) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into account the impact of certain items that are not necessarily ongoing in nature, do not have a high level of predictability associated with them or are non-operational items.
714603_17_ITEM6_P1_S1	Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a useful basis for evaluating underlying business unit performance, but non-GAAP diluted earnings should not be considered in isolation and is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, evaluating business unit performance utilizing GAAP financial information.
714603_17_ITEM6_P1_S2	A description of the use of non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to DST Systems, Inc. and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to DST Systems, Inc. is below.
714603_17_ITEM6_P1_S3	In addition to reporting financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), we have disclosed non-GAAP financial information which has been reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the following financial schedules titled Reconciliation of Reported Diluted Earnings per Share to Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share - Continuing Operations Attributable to DST Systems, Inc.
714603_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	In making these adjustments to determine the non-GAAP results, we take into account the impact of items that are not necessarily ongoing in nature, that do not have a high level of predictability associated with them or that are non-operational in nature.
714603_17_ITEM6_P2_S1	Generally, these items include net gains on dispositions of business units, net gains (losses) associated with securities and other investments, restructuring and impairment costs, and other similar items.
714603_17_ITEM6_P2_S2	Beginning in 2016, we have also included acquired intangible asset amortization for all periods presented.
714603_17_ITEM6_P2_S3	Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a useful basis for evaluating underlying business unit performance, but should not be considered in isolation and is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, evaluating business unit performance utilizing GAAP financial information.
714603_17_ITEM6_P2_S4	Management uses non-GAAP measures in its budgeting and forecasting processes and to further analyze our financial trends and operational run-rate, as well as in making financial comparisons to prior periods presented on a similar basis.
714603_17_ITEM6_P2_S5	We believe that providing such adjusted results allows investors and other users of our financial statements to better understand our comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
714603_17_ITEM6_P2_S6	DST s management uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures in its own evaluation of our performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods.
714603_17_ITEM6_P2_S7	Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.
714603_17_ITEM6_P2_S8	Although our management believes non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the performance of our business, we acknowledge that items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on our financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP.
714603_17_ITEM6_P2_S9	Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP results.
714603_17_ITEM6_P2_S10	These factors should be considered when evaluating our results.

714603_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	This report contains forward-looking statements - that is, statements related to future, not past, events.
714603_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, see, will, would, or target.
714603_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.
714603_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	For us, particular risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include:
714603_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	the other factors that are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.
714603_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	These or other uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements.
714603_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.
714603_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	This document includes certain forward-looking projected financial information that is based on current estimates and forecasts.
714603_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact our financial statements or results of operations are difficult to predict.
714603_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	These forward-looking statements are based on information as of the date of this report and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.
714603_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Introduction DST Systems, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries ( we, our, us, the Company or DST ) use proprietary software applications to provide sophisticated information processing and servicing solutions through strategically unified data management and business processing solutions to clients globally within the asset management, brokerage, retirement, healthcare and other markets.
714603_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our wholly-owned data centers provide the secure technology infrastructure necessary to support our solutions.
714603_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	We manage our business through two operating segments: Financial Services and Healthcare Services.
714603_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our investments in equity securities, private equity investments, real estate and certain financial interests have been aggregated into an Investments and Other segment.
714603_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	In connection with the execution of our strategic plan, which includes focusing on the Financial Services and Healthcare markets, we sold our North American Customer Communications business for cash consideration of $410.7 million on July 1, 2016.
714603_17_ITEM7_P6_S5	We recorded a pretax gain of $341.5 million on the sale during 2016.
714603_17_ITEM7_P6_S6	Additionally, during the second quarter 2016, our Board of Directors approved a plan for management to divest of our U.K. Customer Communications business.
714603_17_ITEM7_P6_S7	As a result of this significant shift in the strategic direction of our operations, we have classified the results of the businesses sold and being sold as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statement of Income for all periods presented.
714603_17_ITEM7_P6_S8	The net after-tax proceeds from the sale are being used in accordance with the Company s capital plan, including investments in the business, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, debt repayments and other corporate purposes.
714603_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Financial Services Segment DST s proprietary software applications enable us to offer our customers information processing solutions that enable them to capture, analyze and report their investors transactions.
714603_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Examples of the services we provide include tracking of purchases, redemptions, exchanges and transfers of shares; maintaining investor identification and ownership records; reconciling cash and share activity; processing dividends; reporting sales; performing tax and other compliance functions; and providing information for printing of investor trade confirmations, statements and year-end tax forms.
714603_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	Services are provided either under a remote processing model or on a BPO basis.
714603_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	Our BPO service offerings are enhanced by our proprietary workflow software, AWD, which is also licensed separately to third parties.
714603_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	In the U.S. we provide services to mutual funds, brokerage firms, retirement plans and alternative investment funds (such as real estate investment trusts) either directly or through BFDS, our joint venture with State Street.
714603_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	In Australia and the U.K., we license software solutions to funds and fund managers, who perform participant accounting and recordkeeping for the wealth management and retirement savings market.
714603_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	We also provide investor services on a Remote and BPO basis internationally (U.K., Canada, Ireland and Luxembourg) solely through IFDS U.K. and IFDS L.P., which are joint ventures with State Street.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts, participants or transactions processed.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	For subaccounts, a portion of the services we provide for registered accounts are provided directly by the broker/dealer.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	As a result, our revenue per account is generally higher for registered accounts than for subaccounts.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	On a more limited basis, we also generate revenue through asset-based fee arrangements and from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in our full service transfer agency bank accounts.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S4	We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S5	We receive revenues for processing services and products provided under various agreements with unconsolidated affiliates.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S6	We believe that the terms of our contracts with unconsolidated affiliates are fair to us and are no less favorable to us than those obtained from unaffiliated parties.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S7	Our operating revenues derived from sales to unconsolidated affiliates, primarily BFDS and IFDS, were $138.5 million , $134.9 million and $135.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S8	We continue to evaluate the products and services we offer within the Financial Services segment and have identified certain offerings in which the increased risk and required investment resulting from recent regulations outweighs the benefit we expect to receive.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S9	As a result of this evaluation, during 2016 we made the decision to exit certain non-core products and services.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S10	We expect the exit of these businesses will result in approximately $8.6 million less operating revenue and $3.8 million less operating income on an annual basis.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S11	Additionally, in November 2016, we sold a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary that provides water billing software and services solutions for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 million , subject to customary working capital post-closing adjustments.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S12	This business had approximately $5.4 million of operating revenue and $1.2 million of operating income on an annual basis.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S13	As these decisions were the result of a tactical review of our products and services, and not the result of a significant shift in strategic direction, the revenue and operating income from these products and services are included within our continuing operations.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S14	We are also continuing to monitor changes in the financial services industry, including the shift from direct products to fee-based platforms which could reduce the number of direct mutual fund registered accounts we service.
714603_17_ITEM7_P9_S15	On February 24, 2016, we acquired all of the membership interests of KRFS, for $94.7 million in cash, after giving effect to a $0.3 million adjustment agreed upon in June 2016 to settle working capital under the terms of the agreement.
714603_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	KRFS is an independent, full-service provider of specialized hedge fund administration services to the global financial community.
714603_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	KRFS hedge fund services include accounting and valuation, back-office outsourcing, investor services, treasury services, and customized reporting.
714603_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	We expect the acquisition to provide us with additional opportunities within the alternative investment marketplace and expand our asset administration service offerings.
714603_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	During 2015, we acquired all of the membership interests of kasina LLC, a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry, and Red Rocks Capital LLC, an asset manager which focuses on listed private equity and other private asset investments.
714603_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	In 2015, we also acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Wealth Management Systems Inc., a provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement marketplace.
714603_17_ITEM7_P10_S5	In December 2015, we entered into a ten year contract with a new client to provide both subaccounting and mutual fund servicing solutions.
714603_17_ITEM7_P10_S6	The client converted approximately 10.0 million subaccounts onto our platform during 2016 and based on current volumes, is expected to convert approximately 2.3 million registered accounts onto our platform by the end of 2017.
714603_17_ITEM7_P10_S7	Implementation efforts have resulted in increased costs that are expected to continue through 2017 as we convert the client onto our platform.
714603_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	During 2014, we sold our wholly-owned U.K. subsidiary, DST Global Solutions Limited and certain related affiliates (together, Global Solutions ).
714603_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Global Solutions provided post-trade, middle-, and back-office investment management software applications, implementation and other professional services.
714603_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Healthcare Services segment uses our proprietary software applications to provide healthcare organizations a variety of medical and pharmacy benefit solutions to satisfy their information processing, quality of care, cost management concerns and payment integrity programs, while achieving compliance and improving operational efficiencies.
714603_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our healthcare solutions include claims adjudication, benefit management, care management, business intelligence and other ancillary services.
714603_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	We also continue to expand and enhance our Healthcare Services offerings to ensure we are able to address the changing needs of our clients within the complex and highly regulated health industries which we serve.
714603_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	For example, our pharmacy management business continues to make investments to expand our clinical, network, and analytic capabilities to help our customers and prospective customers achieve the best possible outcomes for their members and to allow us to more effectively compete in the broader competitive pharmacy benefit manager ( PBM ) market.
714603_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Historically, we have acted as an agent within our pharmacy-solutions business and, accordingly, recognized revenue on a net basis.
714603_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	As our enhanced products evolve and we expand our pharmacy-solutions service offerings, we will evaluate the provisions within our new pharmacy network and customer contracts to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the transactions.
714603_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	If we determine that we are acting as a principal in the transactions, we will report the transactions on a gross basis, resulting in significantly higher revenues and costs reflected within our consolidated financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	We generally derive revenue from our pharmacy-solutions business on a transactional fee basis.
714603_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	Fees are earned on pharmacy claims processing and payments services, pharmacy and member call center services, pharmaceutical rebate administration, administration or management of clinical programs, pharmacy network management, member and plan web services and management information and reporting.
714603_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	Further, revenues include investment earnings related to client cash balances maintained in our bank accounts.
714603_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	Medical claim processing revenues are generally derived from fees charged on a per member/per month basis or transactional basis.
714603_17_ITEM7_P15_S4	We also realize revenue from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage or members increase.
714603_17_ITEM7_P15_S5	Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations.
714603_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	During 2016, two of our Healthcare Services customers notified us that they would begin transitioning their services off our systems effective January 2017.
714603_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	We continue to expect our Healthcare Services segment to achieve strong revenue growth through a combination of new client wins and organic growth.
714603_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	However, we now expect this growth will derive from a smaller revenue base, which will result in lower overall segment revenue growth during 2017 as compared to 2016.
714603_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Investments and Other Segment The Investments and Other segment is comprised of our real estate consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, investments in equity securities, private equity investments and other financial interests.
714603_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	The assets held by this segment are primarily passive in nature.
714603_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	The Investments and Other segment s revenues are derived from rental income from third-party real estate leases.
714603_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	Rental income is recorded as revenue when, based on lease terms, it is earned.
714603_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Investments and Other segment records investment income (dividends, interest and net gains or losses on investment securities) within Other income, net.
714603_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The Investments and Other segment derives part of its income from its pro rata share in the earnings or losses of certain unconsolidated affiliates.
714603_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	We make lease payments to certain real estate joint ventures.
714603_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Seasonality Generally, we do not have significant seasonal fluctuations in our business operations.
714603_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Processing volumes for mutual fund customers within our Financial Services segment are usually highest during the quarter ended March 31 due primarily to processing year-end transactions during January.
714603_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	We have historically added operating equipment in the last half of the year in preparation for processing year-end transactions, which has the effect of increasing costs for the second half of the year.
714603_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	Revenues and operating results from individual license sales vary depending on the timing and size of the contracts.
714603_17_ITEM7_P20_S4	New Authoritative Accounting Guidance See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 , Significant Accounting Policies - New authoritative accounting guidance.
714603_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
714603_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
714603_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
714603_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
714603_17_ITEM7_P21_S4	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; software capitalization and amortization; depreciation of fixed assets; valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill; accounting for investments; and accounting for income taxes.
714603_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned.
714603_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	The majority of our revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided.
714603_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all customer obligations have been met.
714603_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	We generally do not have payment terms from customers that extend beyond one year.
714603_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Billing for services in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.
714603_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectibility is reasonably assured.
714603_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	If there is a customer-specific acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of customer acceptance.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration should be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence, which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S4	If such evidence is unavailable, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S5	We derive over 90% of our revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S6	The majority of our fees are billed on a monthly basis, generally with thirty-day collection terms.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S7	Revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon performance of the services.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S8	Our standard business practice is to bill monthly for development, consulting and training services on a time and materials basis.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S9	In some cases we bill a fixed fee for development and consulting services.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S10	For fixed fee arrangements, we recognize revenue on a proportionate performance basis.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S11	We derive less than 10% of our revenues from licensing products.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S12	We license our wealth management products, AWD products and healthcare administration processing software solutions.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S13	Perpetual software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_17_ITEM7_P24_S14	Deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Term software license revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement.
714603_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	While license fee revenues are not a significant percentage of our total operations, they can significantly impact earnings in the period in which they are recognized.
714603_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Revenues from individual license sales depend heavily on the timing, size and nature of the contract.
714603_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	We recognize revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectibility has been reasonably assured.
714603_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	We may enter into arrangements with broker/dealers or other third parties to sell or market closed-end fund shares.
714603_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	Depending on the arrangement, we may earn distribution fees for marketing and selling the underlying fund shares.
714603_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	Conversely, we may incur distribution expenses, including structuring fees, finders fees and referral fees paid to unaffiliated broker/dealers or introducing parties for marketing and selling underlying fund shares of a closed-end fund we sponsor.
714603_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	revenues and expenses are not significant percentages of our operating revenues or costs and expenses, they can significantly impact operations and earnings in the period in which they are recognized.
714603_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	We have entered into various agreements with related parties, principally unconsolidated affiliates, under which we provide data processing and software services.
714603_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	We believe that the terms of our contracts with related parties are fair to us and are no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties.
714603_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	We assess collection based on a variety of factors, including past collection history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer.
714603_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	We generally do not request collateral from our customers.
714603_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	If we determine that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.
714603_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	Allowances for billing adjustments and doubtful account expense are estimated as revenues are recognized.
714603_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	Allowances for billing adjustments are recorded as reductions in revenues and doubtful account expense is recorded within Costs and expenses.
714603_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	The annual amounts for these items are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Software capitalization and amortization We make substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of our processing services as well as our sale of licensed products.
714603_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	We also develop a large portion of our software internally.
714603_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	We capitalize software development costs for computer software developed or obtained for internal use after the preliminary project phase has been completed and management has committed to funding the project.
714603_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	For computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed to third parties, we capitalize software development costs which are incurred after the products reach technological feasibility but prior to the general release of the product to customers.
714603_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_17_ITEM7_P32_S4	Significant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects.
714603_17_ITEM7_P32_S5	Management specifically evaluates software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts, milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects.
714603_17_ITEM7_P32_S6	Significant changes in any of these items may result in discontinuing capitalization of development costs, as well as immediately expensing previously capitalized costs.
714603_17_ITEM7_P32_S7	We review, on a quarterly basis, our capitalized software for possible impairment.
714603_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Depreciation of fixed assets Our approach on personal property, specifically technology equipment is to own the property as opposed to leasing it where practicable.
714603_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	We believe this approach provides us with better flexibility for disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life.
714603_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	We depreciate technology equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives: (1) non-mainframe equipment three years; (2) mainframe central processing unit four years; and (3) mainframe direct access storage devices five years.
714603_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	We depreciate furniture and fixtures over estimated useful lives, principally three to five years, using accelerated depreciation methods.
714603_17_ITEM7_P33_S4	We depreciate leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements.
714603_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Management judgment is required in assigning economic lives to fixed assets.
714603_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Management specifically analyzes fixed asset additions, remaining net book values and gain/loss upon disposition of fixed assets to determine the appropriateness of assigned economic lives.
714603_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Significant changes in any of these items may result in changes in the economic life assigned and the resulting depreciation expense.
714603_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment.
714603_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	We evaluate the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and evaluate identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
714603_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	Factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy for the overall business; and significant negative industry or economic trends.
714603_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	When it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we assess actual impairment based on gross cash flows.
714603_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our assessment of goodwill for impairment may first include a qualitative assessment that considers various factors, including those described above as well as growth in operating revenues and income from operations of our reporting units since our last quantitative assessment.
714603_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.
714603_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment includes comparing the fair value to the net book value of our reporting units.
714603_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	We estimate fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches.
714603_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is necessary.
714603_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
714603_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	To measure the amount of any impairment loss, we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the affected reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
714603_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	Specifically, we allocate the fair value of the affected reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill.
714603_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.
714603_17_ITEM7_P39_S6	Our 2016 , 2015 and 2014 annual goodwill impairment tests determined that goodwill was not impaired, except during 2016 for the goodwill held at the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit, which is included as a component of discontinued operations, as further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data - Note 4, Discontinued Operations.
714603_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Accounting for investments We have three significant types of investments: 1) investments in available-for-sale securities, the largest of which is our investment in State Street common stock; 2) investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which is comprised principally of BFDS, IFDS U.K., IFDS L.P. and certain real estate joint ventures; and 3) investments in private equity funds and other investments accounted for under the cost method.
714603_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	We account for investments in entities in which we own less than 20% and do not have significant influence in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, which requires us to designate our investments as trading or available-for-sale.
714603_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders equity.
714603_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	We record an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary.
714603_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our financial position.
714603_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	The equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities, partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where we are the limited partner) in which we have significant influence but do not control.
714603_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	We classify these investments as unconsolidated affiliates.
714603_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	Under the equity method, we recognize income or losses from our pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of our investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	The cost method of accounting is used for these investments when we have a de minimis ownership percentage and do not have significant influence.
714603_17_ITEM7_P42_S5	Our cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.
714603_17_ITEM7_P42_S6	Accounting for income taxes We account for income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns.
714603_17_ITEM7_P42_S7	Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).
714603_17_ITEM7_P42_S8	In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.
714603_17_ITEM7_P42_S9	A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
714603_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	We recognize liabilities for potential tax exposures based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be required.
714603_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, then we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary.
714603_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained if challenged by the taxing authorities.
714603_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected.
714603_17_ITEM7_P43_S5	An unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_17_ITEM7_P43_S6	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions within income tax expense.
714603_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Results of Operations The following table summarizes our consolidated operating results (in millions).

714603_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $3.4 million of pretax charges related to employee termination costs as a result of a restructuring initiative within the Healthcare Services segment which involved the closure of an operating location at the end of the existing lease term in mid-2016.
714603_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $8.5 million of pretax charges related to employee and lease termination costs related to a restructuring initiative within our Financial Services segment.

714603_17_ITEM7_P48_S6	Interest expense decreased 1.3% during 2016 as compared to 2015 and 9.5% during 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily from lower weighted average debt balances outstanding.
714603_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Gain on sale of business On November 1, 2016, we sold DST Billing Solutions Limited ( Billing Solutions ) for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 million, subject to customary working capital post-closing adjustments.
714603_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	Operating revenue and income generated for the Billing Solutions business sold was approximately $4.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.
714603_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	We recorded a pretax gain of $5.5 million on the sale of the business during 2016.
714603_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	On November 30, 2014, we sold Global Solutions for cash consideration of $95.0 million , subject to customary working capital post-closing adjustments.
714603_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Of the $95.0 million in proceeds received, $9.5 million was restricted for a period of eighteen months from the transaction, for purposes of payment of potential obligations under the terms and conditions of the sale agreement.
714603_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	The $9.5 million of restricted proceeds held in escrow was received by DST during 2016.
714603_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	During 2015, we received cash proceeds of $7.9 million in settlement of the working capital post-closing adjustment.
714603_17_ITEM7_P50_S4	We recorded a pretax gain of $100.5 million on the sale of the business during 2014.
714603_17_ITEM7_P50_S5	Our pretax gain exceeded our sale proceeds primarily from the reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments due to the substantial liquidation of certain foreign entities, partially offset by transaction costs.
714603_17_ITEM7_P50_S6	The carrying value of the entities sold was minimal.
714603_17_ITEM7_P50_S7	Operating revenue generated from the Global Solutions businesses sold was approximately $61.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
714603_17_ITEM7_P50_S8	Operating income generated from the Global Solutions businesses sold was approximately $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
714603_17_ITEM7_P50_S9	Other income, net The components of other income, net are as follows (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Included in the net realized gains from the disposition of available-for-sale securities during 2015 and 2014 were gains of $157.3 million and $169.3 million , respectively, from the sale of approximately 2.3 million and 2.6 million shares of State Street during 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	There were no sales of State Street shares during 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	We recorded a net gain on private equity funds and other investments of $16.5 million , $35.7 million and $27.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, primarily due to distributions received from certain of our private equity fund investments resulting in realized gains.
714603_17_ITEM7_P51_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments and may require an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our net income.
714603_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	In 2014 , we received cash dividends of $33.2 million from a cost method investment in a privately-held company.
714603_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Following receipt of the dividend, we sold our remaining interest in the privately-held company, resulting in pre-tax cash proceeds and a related gain of $103.6 million .
714603_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	We repurchased $200.0 million of our common stock from a group of stockholders including George L. Argyros, Julia A. Argyros, and certain of their affiliates (collectively, the Argyros Group or Argyros ) during 2014.
714603_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	The price paid per share was determined in connection with the secondary offering of Argyros DST common stock in May 2014.
714603_17_ITEM7_P52_S4	In connection with this share repurchase, we recorded a non-cash gain of $18.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from the change in stock price between the date the share repurchase price became fixed and the settlement date.
714603_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	We receive dividend income from certain investments held, of which State Street is the most significant.
714603_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	State Street s quarterly dividend per common share was $0.38 , $0.34 and $0.30 per share during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	Dividends received from State Street common stock were $3.1 million , $3.2 million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is as follows (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Additional condensed financial information of our significant operating unconsolidated affiliates, BFDS, IFDS U.K. and IFDS L.P., is presented below (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Equity in earnings of IFDS decreased $17.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 , as compared to 2015 , primarily attributable to lower revenues recognized related to the ongoing client conversion activities and higher operating costs as IFDS expands its infrastructure to address increasing regulatory, compliance and security needs.
714603_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	The multi-year implementation efforts for the previously announced two wealth management clients continue to progress, however the scope and timing continues to be adjusted as client requirements evolve.
714603_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	In 2014, IFDS began capitalizing a significant portion of the software development costs being incurred to develop the wealth management platform for the U.K. market resulting in approximately 146.2 million ( 73.1 million at DST s 50% ownership) of capitalized costs through December 31, 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	These costs will continue to be incurred as the platform is completed.
714603_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Equity in earnings of IFDS increased $10.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 , as compared to 2014 , primarily attributable to higher revenues recognized related to the ongoing client conversion activities of the wealth management platform clients in the U.K., organic growth at existing customers and new client processing revenues.
714603_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Partially offsetting the increased revenues are higher operating costs as IFDS expands its infrastructure to prepare for the addition of new clients and associated service offerings as well as negative foreign currency impacts in both the U.K. and Canada.
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	IFDS shareowner accounts serviced on their shareowner accounting platforms were 22.6 million at December 31, 2016 , an increase of 0.5 million accounts or 2.3% as compared to December 31, 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	The increase was primarily due to organic growth and new client conversions.
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	IFDS shareowner accounts serviced were 22.1 million at December 31, 2015 , a decrease of 1.7 million accounts or 7.1% as compared to December 31, 2014 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	The decline in accounts from 2014 to 2015 was driven by the transition of one of IFDS clients off of the FAST platform and onto the wealth management platform in 2015.
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S4	Equity in earnings of BFDS increased $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S5	The increase was primarily attributable to higher ancillary and non-operating revenues as well as a reduction in operating costs.
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S6	Equity in earnings of BFDS increased $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S7	The increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in operating costs.
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S8	Our equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of $3.5 million as compared to 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S9	The decrease was primarily due to a $3.6 million gain resulting from the sale of real estate by an unconsolidated affiliate during 2015.
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S10	Our equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $10.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 , an decrease of $0.3 million as compared to 2014 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P58_S11	The decrease was primarily due to a $5.7 million gain recognized upon the sale of an unconsolidated affiliate during 2014, partially offset by a $3.6 million gain resulting from the sale of real estate by an unconsolidated affiliate during 2015.
714603_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 36.2% , 32.5% and 24.7% for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	The effective tax rates in each of the three years ended December 31, 2016 were affected by tax benefits relating to certain international operations and recognition of state tax benefits associated with income apportionment rules.
714603_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	Our income tax rate for 2016 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily attributable to state income taxes, transaction related taxes, and a change in the proportional mix of domestic and international income, partially offset by federal income tax credits for foreign income taxes and research and development costs.
714603_17_ITEM7_P59_S3	Our effective income tax rate for 2015 was favorably impacted by a $11.9 million benefit from the completion of the IRS examination of previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions, research and experimentation credits and capital losses for the period 2010 as well as other remeasurements during the period.
714603_17_ITEM7_P59_S4	Our effective income tax rate for 2014 was favorably impacted by the reversal of $30.8 million of uncertain tax position liabilities, net of additions, primarily related to statute expirations.
714603_17_ITEM7_P59_S5	Excluding the effect of discrete period items, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 37% in 2017 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P59_S6	The 2017 tax rate can be affected as a result of variances among the estimates and amounts of 2017 sources of taxable income (e.g., domestic consolidated, joint venture and/or international), the realization of tax credits, adjustments which may arise from the resolution of tax matters under review and our assessment of our liability for uncertain tax positions.
714603_17_ITEM7_P59_S7	Income from discontinued operations, net of tax Income from discontinued operations, net of tax increased $199.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and increased $16.0 million or 49.2% during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P59_S8	The increase is primarily attributable to the $234.7 million gain, net of tax, on the sale of our North American Customer Communications business partially offset by the goodwill and asset impairments in our U.K. Customer Communications business.
714603_17_ITEM7_P59_S9	In February 2017, we updated our impairment analysis utilizing new information received regarding our U.K. Customer Communications business which indicated the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the business.
714603_17_ITEM7_P59_S10	As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.0 million , which is included as a component of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
714603_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	No tax benefit was recognized for this impairment charge.

714603_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven from businesses acquired during 2015 and 2016, which contributed $31.8 million of incremental operating revenues as well as increased professional services revenues associated with our international wealth management platform business.
714603_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	During 2016, we also completed the conversion of approximately 10.0 million subaccounts associated with the previously announced new client, which resulted in incremental revenues.
714603_17_ITEM7_P63_S3	These increases were partly offset by a decline in mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenue due to lower registered accounts, primarily as a result of subaccounting conversions, lower revenue due to extending certain long-term contracts with lower pricing, and approximately $6.1 million of negative foreign currency movements during 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P63_S4	Additionally, software license revenues were $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of $2.3 million as compared to 2015 .

714603_17_ITEM7_P63_S9	On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2016 was primarily from acquisitions completed during 2015 and 2016, which included approximately $33.7 million of incremental expenses.
714603_17_ITEM7_P63_S10	Also, contributing to the increase in costs and expenses were the restructuring activities, which resulted in $10.4 million of employee and lease termination costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 to enhance operational efficiency within the Financial Services segment, increased costs incurred to enhance the network infrastructure utilized across all of our operating business and incremental costs to service new and existing clients.
714603_17_ITEM7_P63_S11	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we also recognized a $6.0 million software impairment.
714603_17_ITEM7_P63_S12	These costs and expenses were partially offset by the reversal of approximately $6.5 million of accrued performance-related contingent consideration, a $9.6 million reduction of stock compensation expense as certain performance-based stock units ( PSU ) are no longer expected to vest, savings realized from cost containment initiatives and $7.2 million of foreign currency movements.
714603_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Depreciation and amortization Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $79.7 million , an increase of $8.1 million or 11.3% as compared to 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	The increase in 2016 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization associated with acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016 as well as increased depreciation from capitalized costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure and increase security and regulatory compliance.
714603_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	The increase in 2016 was also attributable to the acceleration of depreciation on certain capitalized software during 2016.

714603_17_ITEM7_P64_S5	These decreases were partially offset by the reversal of accrued performance-related contingent consideration, higher operating revenues and cost containment efforts during 2016, as well as a reduction of stock compensation expense as certain PSUs are no longer expected to vest.
714603_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	The impacts on operating income from foreign currency movements were not significant.

714603_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	The decrease in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the sale of Global Solutions in November of 2014 and foreign currency movements.
714603_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	Global Solutions contributed $61.4 million of operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and foreign currency movements reduced operating revenue by approximately $16.2 million during 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	Excluding Global Solutions 2014 results and the foreign currency impacts, Financial Services operating revenues increased $52.6 million or 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 , primarily driven from year-over-year growth across a number of our service offerings.
714603_17_ITEM7_P66_S4	Specifically, operating revenues increased as a result of increased professional services revenue associated with our wealth management platform business as well as organic and new client growth within our Retirement and Brokerage Solutions businesses.

714603_17_ITEM7_P66_S12	On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2015 was primarily from acquisitions completed during 2015, which included approximately $4.7 million of incremental expenses related to performance-related contingent consideration.
714603_17_ITEM7_P66_S13	The increase in costs and expenses was also attributable to increased security, regulatory compliance and network infrastructure costs, as well as higher costs associated with new business initiatives as we expand our service offerings and expand our wealth management platform in the U.K.
714603_17_ITEM7_P66_S14	These costs and expenses were partially offset by lower transaction and advisory costs of $1.2 million in 2015 as compared to $5.6 million of advisory and transaction costs incurred during 2014 in connection with the Argyros transaction and $13.0 million of costs incurred in 2014 related to restructuring activities.

714603_17_ITEM7_P66_S21	Operating income was also adversely impacted by approximately $6.2 million of incremental expense resulting from amortization of acquired intangibles and expense for performance-related contingent consideration associated with our 2015 acquisitions.
714603_17_ITEM7_P66_S22	These decreases were partially offset by lower costs incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken in 2014.

714603_17_ITEM7_P71_S12	Costs were also higher due to the resolution of a previously disclosed regulatory inquiry which resulted in the reversal of $4.0 million previously accrued in excess of the final settlement amount of $2.0 million during 2014.

714603_17_ITEM7_P78_S2	Cash flows used in continuing investing activities during 2015 of $102.4 million were primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $192.2 million , which includes $176.1 million of pretax proceeds from the sale of State Street stock.
714603_17_ITEM7_P78_S3	These sources of cash were offset by $117.4 million of cash used to acquire kasina LLC, Red Rocks Capital LLC and Wealth Management Systems Inc. during 2015 and $88.9 million used to purchase capital assets, as well as higher restricted cash balances for client fund obligations.
714603_17_ITEM7_P78_S4	Cash flows provided from continuing investing activities were $335.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $343.0 million , which includes $190.3 million of pretax proceeds from the sale of State Street stock.
714603_17_ITEM7_P78_S5	Additionally, in 2014 cash flows from investing activities increased due to proceeds received from sale of Global Solutions of $77.4 million and proceeds from sale of non-operating real estate of $32.2 million .
714603_17_ITEM7_P78_S6	These cash inflows were partially offset by capital expenditures of $82.6 million .
714603_17_ITEM7_P78_S7	The following table summarizes capital expenditures by segment (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	During 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , we capitalized software development costs of $21.5 million , $23.3 million and $28.8 million , respectively, which are included within the capital expenditures listed above.
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	Capital expenditures using debt are treated as non-cash transactions and are not included in the annual capital expenditure amounts above.
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S2	We anticipate our 2017 capital expenditures for continuing operations to total approximately $70.0 million .
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S3	Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded primarily by cash flows from operating activities or through borrowings on our revolving credit facilities.
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S4	Financing Activities Cash flows used in continuing financing activities totaled $374.8 million , $278.7 million and $526.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S5	Common Stock Issuances and Repurchases We received cash proceeds of $5.3 million , $11.8 million and $13.0 million from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of employee stock options during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S6	The value of shares received in exchange for satisfaction of the exercise price and for tax-withholding obligations arising from the exercise of options to purchase our stock or from the vesting of restricted shares are included in Common stock repurchased in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S7	On June 13, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new $300.0 million share repurchase plan, which allows, but does not require, the repurchase of common stock in open market and private transactions.
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S8	The plan does not have an expiration date.
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S9	We repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $300.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S10	Subsequently, during January and February 2017, we repurchased an additional 0.7 million shares of our common stock for $75.0 million resulting in approximately $75.0 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan authorized in 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S11	Under previous share repurchase plans, we expended $400.0 million for approximately 3.6 million shares and $200.0 million for approximately 2.2 million shares during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S12	As of March 23, 2014, Argyros beneficially owned 9.2 million shares or approximately 22% of DST common shares.
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S13	During March 2014, we entered into an agreement under which we agreed to a two-step process to assist Argyros with the disposition of a substantial portion of its common stock ownership in DST.
714603_17_ITEM7_P79_S14	To implement Argyros disposition, we facilitated the May 2014 registered, secondary common stock offering of $450.0 million (before any overallotment option) of DST common stock beneficially owned by Argyros.
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	secondary offering, DST repurchased, and simultaneously retired, 2.4 million shares of our common stock from Argyros for $200.0 million.
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	In connection with this share repurchase, we recorded a non-cash gain of $18.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from the change in stock price between the date the share repurchase price became fixed and the settlement date.
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	Dividends We paid cash dividends of $1.32 per common share in 2016 and $1.20 per common share in both 2015 and 2014 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S3	The total cash paid for dividends in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $43.4 million , $43.1 million and $47.6 million , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S4	On January 25, 2017 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share on our common stock, payable on March 10, 2017 , to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 24, 2017 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S5	Future cash dividends will depend upon financial condition, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S6	Client Funds Obligations Client funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us.
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S7	In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency client balances invested overnight.
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S8	We had $564.6 million , $533.4 million and $ 399.6 million of client funds obligations at December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S9	Debt Activity During 2016 , we had the following primary sources of debt financing: our syndicated revolving credit facility; accounts receivable securitization program; and privately placed senior notes (the Senior Notes ).
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S10	We had $508.2 million , $562.1 million and $552.9 million of debt outstanding at December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, a decrease of $53.9 million during 2016 and an increase of $9.2 million during 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S11	The decrease in debt outstanding during 2016 was primarily resulting from the utilization of the proceeds from the sale of our North American Customer Communications business to pay down outstanding balances, partially offset by borrowings to fund the KRFS business acquisition, share repurchases and working capital uses.
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S12	The increase in debt outstanding during 2015 was primarily from higher borrowings on the syndicated revolving credit facility, partially offset by the repayment of the Series A Senior Notes and the pay down of the accounts receivable securitization line.
714603_17_ITEM7_P80_S13	In 2015 , we renewed our accounts receivable securitization program for a three year term through May 2018.
714603_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Our debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary indebtedness, asset dispositions and require certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	We are currently in compliance with these covenants.
714603_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	A default under certain of our borrowings could trigger defaults under certain of our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in their maturities being accelerated.
714603_17_ITEM7_P81_S3	Our debt arrangements are further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 , Debt.
714603_17_ITEM7_P81_S4	The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Interest obligations on our outstanding debt are not included in the table above.
714603_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	The syndicated revolving credit facility contains grid schedules that adjust borrowing costs up or down based upon our consolidated leverage ratio.
714603_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	The grid schedules may result in fluctuations in borrowing costs ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% over Eurodollar and 0.00% to 0.70% over base rate , as defined.
714603_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	The Senior Notes have fixed interest rates and are comprised of $105.0 million of 4.86% Series B Senior Notes, $65.0 million of 5.06% Series C Senior Notes and $160.0 million of 5.42% Series D Senior Notes.
714603_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	In addition to the financial instruments listed above, the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization program are determined based on variable interest rates associated with LIBOR.
714603_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	We have liabilities for income tax uncertainties of $69.8 million at December 31, 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	These obligations are classified as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as resolution of these matters is expected to take more than a year; however, the ultimate timing of resolution is uncertain.
714603_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	Other Commercial Commitments In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products and other business assets, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters.
714603_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties.
714603_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.
714603_17_ITEM7_P87_S3	At December 31, 2016 , except for certain immaterial items, there were no liabilities for guarantees or indemnifications as it is not possible to determine either the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements or the timing of any such payments due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
714603_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Historically, payments made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
714603_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.
714603_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	We believe that our guarantee arrangements will not have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures, capital resources, liquidity or results of operations.
714603_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	These arrangements are described above and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 , Commitments and Contingencies.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Available-for-sale equity price risk Our investments in available-for-sale equity securities are subject to price risk.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The fair value of our available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $180.5 million .
714603_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The impact of a 10% change in fair value of these investments would have been approximately $11.2 million to comprehensive income.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Changes in equity values of our investments have had and could have a material effect on our comprehensive income (loss) and financial position.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest rate risk We and certain of our joint ventures derive service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which we are the agent for clients.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The balances maintained in the bank accounts will fluctuate.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2016 , DST and BFDS had average daily cash balances of approximately $2.0 billion maintained in such accounts, of which approximately $1.2 billion were maintained at BFDS.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We estimate that a 100 basis point change in the short-term interest earnings rate would equal approximately $7.1 million of net income (loss).
714603_17_ITEM7A_P1_S4	At December 31, 2016 , we had $508.2 million of debt, of which $178.2 million was subject to variable interest rates (Federal Funds rates, LIBOR rates, Prime rates).
714603_17_ITEM7A_P1_S5	We estimate that a 10% increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact to our consolidated pretax earnings or to the fair value of our debt.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P1_S6	The effect of changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt is mitigated by changes in interest rates attributable to balance earnings.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate risk The operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in our exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The principal currencies involved are the British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Thai baht and Indian rupee.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our international subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	We translate our assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and translate income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Currency exchange rate fluctuations have not historically significantly affected our consolidated financial results.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2016 , our international subsidiaries for our continuing operations had approximately $135.3 million in total assets and for the year ended December 31, 2016 , these international subsidiaries recorded net income of approximately $25.4 million .
714603_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We estimate that a 10% change in exchange rates would have changed total consolidated assets by approximately $13.5 million .
714603_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Furthermore, a 10% change in exchange rates based upon historical earnings in international operations would have changed consolidated net income for 2016 by approximately $2.5 million .
714603_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We have entered into foreign currency cash flow and economic hedging programs to mitigate the impact of movements in foreign currency (principally British pound, Australian dollar and Thai baht) on our operations.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The total notional value of our foreign currency derivatives is $105.9 million at December 31, 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $0.1 million at December 31, 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM7A_P6_S3	We estimate that a 10% change in exchange rates would result in a $0.4 million change in other comprehensive income.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $0.3 million at December 31, 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM7A_P6_S5	We estimate a 10% change in exchange rates on these contracts would result in a $5.5 million change to consolidated net income.
714603_17_ITEM7A_P6_S6	Gains and losses on the derivative instruments are largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in a minimal impact on earnings.
714603_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Stockholders of DST Systems, Inc.:
714603_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DST Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
714603_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
714603_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
714603_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
714603_17_ITEM8_P1_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
714603_17_ITEM8_P1_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
714603_17_ITEM8_P1_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
714603_17_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
714603_17_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
714603_17_ITEM8_P1_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
714603_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
714603_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

714603_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	Description of Business DST Systems, Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries ( we, our, us, the Company or DST ) use proprietary software applications to provide sophisticated information processing and servicing solutions, through strategically unified business processing and data management, to clients globally within the asset management, brokerage, retirement, healthcare and other markets.
714603_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	Our wholly-owned data centers provide the secure technology infrastructure necessary to support our solutions.
714603_17_ITEM8_P9_S2	We manage our business through our two operating segments, Financial Services and Healthcare Services.
714603_17_ITEM8_P9_S3	Investments in equity securities, private equity investments, real estate and certain financial interests have been aggregated into the Investments and Other segment.
714603_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	On July 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our North American Customer Communications business.
714603_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	Additionally, during 2016, our Board of Directors approved a plan for management to pursue the divestiture of our United Kingdom Customer Communications business.
714603_17_ITEM8_P10_S2	As a result, beginning in 2016, the Customer Communications segment, as well as certain businesses previously reported within the Financial Services segment that were part of the July 1, 2016 sale, have been reported as discontinued operations.
714603_17_ITEM8_P10_S3	Prior period amounts have been adjusted to be consistent with the current discontinued operations presentation.
714603_17_ITEM8_P10_S4	See Note 4 , Discontinued Operations , for additional information.
714603_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The consolidated financial statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company.
714603_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
714603_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	Certain amounts in the 2015 and 2014 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.
714603_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	We consolidate any entity in which we have a controlling financial interest.
714603_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Under the voting interest model, generally the investor that has voting control (usually more than 50% of an entity s voting interests) consolidates the entity.
714603_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	Under the variable interest entity ( VIE ) model, the party that has the power to direct the entity s most significant economic activities and the ability to participate in the entity s economics consolidates the entity.
714603_17_ITEM8_P13_S2	An entity is considered a VIE if it possesses one of the following characteristics: 1) the entity is thinly capitalized; 2) residual equity holders do not control the entity; 3) equity holders are shielded from economic losses; 4) equity holders do not participate fully in an entity s residual economics; and 5) the entity was established with non-substantive voting interests.
714603_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	For consolidated subsidiaries that are less than wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as non-controlling interests.
714603_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	Non-controlling interests that are redeemable or convertible for cash or other assets at the option of the holder are classified separate from stockholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_17_ITEM8_P14_S2	The portion of net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest for such subsidiaries is presented as net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	We have the following significant operating joint ventures: BFDS; IFDS U.K.; and IFDS L.P.
714603_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	We do not have a controlling financial interest in these entities and therefore account for the financial results of these operating joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.
714603_17_ITEM8_P15_S2	We are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering a large portion of our Kansas City, Missouri-based leased office facilities.
714603_17_ITEM8_P15_S3	The lessors are generally joint ventures (in which we have a 50% ownership) that have been established specifically to purchase, finance and engage in leasing activities with the joint venture partners and unrelated third parties.
714603_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Our analysis of our real estate joint ventures for all periods presented indicate that none qualified as a VIE and, accordingly, they have not been consolidated.
714603_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	We provide investment management services to, and have transactions with, various exchange traded funds, mutual funds and other investment products sponsored by the Company in the normal course of business.
714603_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	We generally are considered to have a controlling financial interest in a fund when we own a majority of the outstanding controlling shares, which may arise as a result of seed capital investments in newly launched investment products from the time of initial launch to the time that the fund becomes majority-held by third-party investors.
714603_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
714603_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
714603_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned.
714603_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	The majority of our revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided.
714603_17_ITEM8_P19_S2	Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all customer obligations have been met.
714603_17_ITEM8_P19_S3	We generally do not have payment terms from customers that extend beyond one year.
714603_17_ITEM8_P19_S4	Revenue from operating leases is recognized monthly as the rent accrues.
714603_17_ITEM8_P19_S5	Billing for services in which cash is collected in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.
714603_17_ITEM8_P19_S6	Allowances for billing adjustments and doubtful account expense are estimated as revenues are recognized.
714603_17_ITEM8_P19_S7	Allowances for billing adjustments are recorded as reductions in revenues and doubtful account expense is recorded within Costs and expenses.
714603_17_ITEM8_P19_S8	The annual amounts for these items are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P19_S9	We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectibility is reasonably assured.
714603_17_ITEM8_P19_S10	If there is a customer-specific acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of customer acceptance.
714603_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
714603_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
714603_17_ITEM8_P20_S3	Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence, which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items.
714603_17_ITEM8_P20_S4	If such evidence is unavailable, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.
714603_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	Deferral of software license revenue results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_17_ITEM8_P21_S2	We recognize revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectibility has been reasonably assured.
714603_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket ( OOP ) expenses, such as postage and telecommunications charges, are recorded as revenue on an accrual basis.
714603_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	Because these additional revenues are offset by the reimbursable expenses incurred, they have minimal impact on income from operations and net income.
714603_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	For each segment, total revenues are reported in two categories, operating revenues and OOP reimbursements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P22_S3	OOP expenses are included in costs and expenses.
714603_17_ITEM8_P22_S4	Costs and expenses Costs and expenses include all costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, incurred to produce revenues.
714603_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	We believe that the nature of our business as well as our organizational structure, in which virtually all officers and associates have operational responsibilities, does not allow for a meaningful segregation of selling, general and administrative costs.
714603_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	These costs, which we believe to be immaterial, are also included in costs and expenses.
714603_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Substantially all depreciation and amortization is directly associated with the production of revenues.
714603_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Cash equivalents Short-term liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents.
714603_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	Due to the short-term nature of these investments, carrying value approximates market value.
714603_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Client funds/obligations Funds held on behalf of clients In connection with providing data processing services for our clients, we may hold client funds on behalf of transfer agency clients and pharmacy processing clients.

714603_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	Invested balances are returned to the full service mutual fund transfer agency client accounts the following business day.
714603_17_ITEM8_P27_S2	Funds received from clients for the payment of pharmacy claims incurred by its members are invested until the claim payments are presented to the bank.
714603_17_ITEM8_P27_S3	These amounts are included in funds held on behalf of clients in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent assets that are restricted for use.
714603_17_ITEM8_P27_S4	Client funding receivable Client funding receivables represent amounts due to us for pharmacy claims paid in advance of receiving client funding and for pharmacy claims processed for which client funding requests have not been made.
714603_17_ITEM8_P27_S5	Client funds obligations Client funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us.
714603_17_ITEM8_P27_S6	In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency client balances invested overnight.
714603_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	We have reported the cash flows related to the purchases of investment funds (available-for-sale securities) held on behalf of clients and the cash flows related to the proceeds from the sales/maturities of investment funds held on behalf of clients on a gross basis in the investing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

714603_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	We have reported the cash flows related to client funds used in investing activities on a net basis within net increase (decrease) in client funds obligations in the financing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	The equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities, partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where we are the limited partner) in which we have significant influence but do not control.
714603_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	Under the equity method, we recognize income or losses from our pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of our investment in and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_17_ITEM8_P29_S3	The cost method of accounting is used for these investments when we have a de minimis ownership percentage and do not have significant influence.
714603_17_ITEM8_P29_S4	Our cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.
714603_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Investments classified as available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income.
714603_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	Investments in trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.
714603_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	Investments classified as held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
714603_17_ITEM8_P30_S3	Investment funds which are consolidated as a result of our seed capital investment are considered investment companies and therefore we retain the specialized industry accounting principles of these investment products in our consolidated financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Upon consolidation of a fund, the underlying securities of the fund are reflected at fair value with gains and losses included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Security transactions and investment income Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date.
714603_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	Security gains and losses are calculated on the specific identification method.
714603_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.
714603_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	Interest income, adjusted for discounts and premiums, is recorded on the accrual basis.

714603_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	We review, on a quarterly basis, our property and equipment for possible impairment.
714603_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	We capitalize costs for the development of internal use software, including coding and software configuration costs and costs of upgrades and enhancements, after the preliminary project phase has been completed and management has committed to funding the project.
714603_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis, depending on the nature of the project, generally over a three to five year period.
714603_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	We review, on a quarterly basis, our capitalized software for possible impairment.
714603_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	Development costs for software that will be sold or licensed to third parties, prior to the achievement of technological feasibility, are expensed as incurred.
714603_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	We capitalize software development costs for software that will be sold or licensed to third parties which are incurred after the products reach technological feasibility but prior to the general release of the product to customers.
714603_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	These capitalized development costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis using the greater of the amount computed by taking the ratio of current year s gross revenues to current and anticipated future gross revenues or the amount computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the product, which is generally three to five years.
714603_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	We evaluate the net realizable value of capitalized software development costs on a product-by-product basis.
714603_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets We have recorded goodwill and intangible assets in connection with various acquisitions of businesses.
714603_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Intangible assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily represent customer relationships and other definite lived intangible assets (trade names, non-compete agreements, etc.) acquired.
714603_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	The estimated useful life on these intangible assets ranges from 3 to 19 years.
714603_17_ITEM8_P43_S2	The weighted average amortization period at December 31, 2016 for customer relationships and other intangible assets is 14.7 and 8.7 years, respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	We assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and assess identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
714603_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.
714603_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Our assessment of goodwill for impairment for 2016 included a quantitative assessment that compared the fair value to the net book value of our reporting units.
714603_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows and substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units.
714603_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	For 2015, we performed a qualitative assessment that considered various factors, including growth in operating revenues and income from operations of our reporting units since our last quantitative assessment in 2014.
714603_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	Our 2016 , 2015 and 2014 annual goodwill impairment tests determined that goodwill was not impaired, except during 2016 for the goodwill held at the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit, which is included as a component of discontinued operations, as further described in Note 4, Discontinued Operations.
714603_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	Income taxes We recognize the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.
714603_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	Deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the liability method.
714603_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and differences between the income tax and financial accounting statement bases of assets and liabilities and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment.
714603_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	The income statement effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes on the balance sheet.
714603_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	From time to time, we enter into transactions for which the tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code or applicable state tax laws is uncertain.
714603_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	We provide federal and/or state income taxes on such transactions, together with related interest, net of income tax benefit, and any applicable penalties in accordance with accounting guidance for income tax uncertainties.
714603_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	We record income tax uncertainties that are estimated to take more than 12 months to resolve as non-current.
714603_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are recorded in income tax expense.

714603_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	Diluted earnings per share are determined by including the dilutive effect of all potential common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	See Note 13 , Equity , for additional details regarding our earnings per share computation.
714603_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	Derivative and hedging activities We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value and the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
714603_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	From time to time, we utilize derivatives to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
714603_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	We do not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes.
714603_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had derivative instruments outstanding as described in Note 11 , Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments .
714603_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	Comprehensive income Our comprehensive income consists of net income and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, our proportional share of unconsolidated affiliates other comprehensive income (limited by the carrying value of the investment), unrealized gains or losses on our cash flow hedges and foreign currency translation adjustments, which are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, net of tax and reclassifications to earnings.
714603_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	Share-based compensation We have share-based compensation plans covering our employees and our non-employee directors and have outstanding share awards (primarily in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units) under each of these plans.
714603_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	We recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards offset by estimates of compensation costs related to awards that are not expected to vest.
714603_17_ITEM8_P56_S3	For share-based awards granted, we expense the grant date fair value of these awards using the straight-line method over the service period.
714603_17_ITEM8_P56_S4	Amortization for the grant date fair value of share-based awards containing both service and performance features depends on our judgments on whether the performance conditions will be achieved.
714603_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance which requires the statement of cash flows to explain changes during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
714603_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 and requires retrospective application.
714603_17_ITEM8_P57_S2	We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires the recognition of income tax consequences for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
714603_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 and requires modified retrospective application.
714603_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance to clarify how certain transactions are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
714603_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted.
714603_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	We do not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows.
714603_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
714603_17_ITEM8_P60_S2	We expect increased volatility in earnings as the excess tax benefits driven by changes in our stock price will be recorded to the Consolidated Statement of Income upon adoption.
714603_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations.
714603_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted.
714603_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	modified retrospective method, with elective reliefs, which requires application of the new guidance for all periods presented.
714603_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
714603_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which updates the reporting model for certain financial instruments, including the requirement for equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.
714603_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 and requires a cumulative-effective adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
714603_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
714603_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts in a business combination that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
714603_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	Effects on earnings as a result of the change to the provisional amounts should be recorded in the same period s financial statements and calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.
714603_17_ITEM8_P67_S2	The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued guidance which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a Variable Interest Entity ( VIE ), and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE.
714603_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	It also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities.
714603_17_ITEM8_P68_S2	In connection with the adoption of the guidance on January 1, 2016, the Company reevaluated all of its investment products for consolidation and determined that certain of its investments in private equity funds met the definition of a VIE as our equity interests lacked the characteristics of a controlling financial interest.
714603_17_ITEM8_P68_S3	The revised consolidation guidance did not result in consolidation of any of our investments.
714603_17_ITEM8_P68_S4	See Note 5, Investments, for additional details regarding our investments in variable interest entities.
714603_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance which requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
714603_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	The new standard and subsequently issued amendments will become effective for us beginning with the first quarter 2018, and although permitted, we will not early adopt this guidance.
714603_17_ITEM8_P69_S2	We are in the process of selecting the method of adoption, either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition approach, however we have not yet determined the method by which the standard will be adopted.
714603_17_ITEM8_P69_S3	In addition, we are currently evaluating the impacts of the application of the new standard to our existing portfolio of customer contracts and will continue to review new contracts entered into prior to the adoption of the new standard.
714603_17_ITEM8_P69_S4	While we expect the adoption of the standard will change the timing of when revenue is recognized for certain revenue streams, we anticipate that the majority of our contracts with customers will be accounted for under the series deliverable guidance in the new standard which will likely result in no change as compared to current revenue recognition.
714603_17_ITEM8_P69_S5	We expect to continue finalizing our assessment of the expected impact of adoption throughout 2017.
714603_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	LLC On February 24, 2016, we acquired all of the membership interests of KRFS, for $94.7 million in cash, after giving effect to a $0.3 million adjustment agreed upon in June 2016 to settle working capital under the terms of the agreement.

714603_17_ITEM8_P82_S7	Our pretax gain exceeded our sale proceeds primarily from the reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments due to the substantial liquidation of certain foreign entities, partially offset by transaction costs.

714603_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	In February 2017, we updated our impairment analysis utilizing new information received (level 3 in the fair value hierarchy) regarding our U.K. Customer Communications business which indicated the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the business.
714603_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.0 million , which is included as a component of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
714603_17_ITEM8_P89_S2	The impairment resulted in the write-down of goodwill and long-lived assets of the business based on the estimated fair value.
714603_17_ITEM8_P89_S3	There was no tax benefit recognized for this impairment charge as it is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
714603_17_ITEM8_P89_S4	These amounts reflect management s preliminary estimates and subsequent negotiations and the closing on any sale of this business could result in further adjustments to this impairment.

714603_17_ITEM8_P112_S1	These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
714603_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we held certain investment assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

714603_17_ITEM8_P126_S1	Our 2016 annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units.
714603_17_ITEM8_P126_S2	Due to the new segment reporting effective as of January 1, 2015, goodwill of approximately $6.7 million was reallocated to the Financial Services segment from the former Customer Communications segment based on the relative fair values of the businesses transfered.
714603_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	As mentioned in Note 1 , Description of Business , we completed the sale of our North American Customer Communications business and announced our intent to dispose of our United Kingdom Customer Communications business during 2016.
714603_17_ITEM8_P127_S1	As a result, the Customer Communications segment has been reported as discontinued operations.
714603_17_ITEM8_P127_S2	Prior period amounts above have been revised to reflect the reallocated goodwill.
714603_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	Debt The Company is obligated under notes and other indebtedness as follows (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	Accounts receivable securitization program We securitize certain of our domestic accounts receivable through an accounts receivable securitization program with a third-party bank.
714603_17_ITEM8_P129_S1	The maximum amount that can be outstanding under this program is $150.0 million .
714603_17_ITEM8_P129_S2	The facility matures in May 2018, unless renewed.
714603_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	As a result of the sale of the North American Customer Communications business, it was removed from the accounts receivable securitization program resulting in a reduction in the receivables eligible to be borrowed against in 2016.
714603_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	Under the terms of the accounts receivable securitization program, (a) we periodically acquire accounts receivable originated by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, DST Health Solutions, DST Technologies and Argus Health Systems (the Subsidiary Originators ), (b) we transfer receivables originated by us and receivables acquired from the Subsidiary Originators, on a periodic basis, to a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of DST (the SPE ), and (c) the SPE then sells undivided interests in the receivables to the bank.
714603_17_ITEM8_P131_S1	We retain servicing responsibility over the receivables.
714603_17_ITEM8_P131_S2	The program contains customary restrictive covenants as well as customary events of default.
714603_17_ITEM8_P131_S3	We have continuing involvement with the transferred assets because we maintain servicing responsibilities for the accounts receivable assets included in the accounts receivable securitization program.
714603_17_ITEM8_P131_S4	Accounts receivable assets transferred from us to our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary contain restrictions because they are not available to satisfy the creditors of any other person, including DST or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates.
714603_17_ITEM8_P131_S5	Further, neither we nor the SPE guarantees collectibility of the receivables or the creditworthiness of obligors.
714603_17_ITEM8_P131_S6	The SPE retains an interest in the receivables in excess of the amount transferred to the conduit, and such receivables continue to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_17_ITEM8_P131_S7	The carrying value of the retained interest approximates its estimated fair value at the balance sheet date.
714603_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	increases in the level of assumed interest rates and/or credit losses compared to assumptions in effect at the balance sheet date by 10% or 20% would not materially affect the fair value of the retained interest at the reporting date.
714603_17_ITEM8_P132_S1	The outstanding amount under the program was $103.2 million at December 31, 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM8_P132_S2	There was no outstanding amount under the program at December 31, 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM8_P132_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 total proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program were approximately $895.5 million , $1,037.7 million and $1,024.7 million , respectively, and total repayments were approximately $792.3 million , $1,157.7 million and $1,054.7 million , respectively, which comprise the net cash flow in the financing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_17_ITEM8_P132_S4	Aggregate transfers of undivided interests in the receivables from the SPE to the bank were $1,459.9 million and $1,807.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P132_S5	The impact on net income stemming from these transfers was not material.
714603_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	Costs associated with the accounts receivable securitization program are included in interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_17_ITEM8_P133_S1	The program costs applicable to the outstanding amount of undivided interests in the receivables are generally based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
714603_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	Revolving credit facilities On October 1, 2014, we entered into a new syndicated credit facility ( Credit Facility ).
714603_17_ITEM8_P134_S1	The Credit Facility provides for a revolving unsecured line in an aggregate principal amount of up to $850.0 million .
714603_17_ITEM8_P134_S2	The interest rates applicable to loans under the Credit Facility are generally based on Eurodollar, Federal Funds or prime rates plus applicable margins as defined in the agreement.
714603_17_ITEM8_P134_S3	The Credit Facility contains grid schedules that adjust borrowing costs up or down based upon our consolidated leverage ratio.
714603_17_ITEM8_P134_S4	The grid schedules may result in fluctuations in borrowing costs ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% over Eurodollar and 0.00% to 0.70% over base rate , as defined.
714603_17_ITEM8_P134_S5	Additionally, we pay an annual facility fee of 0.125% to 0.30% .
714603_17_ITEM8_P134_S6	Among other provisions, the Credit Facility requires certain leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	If any event of default occurs and is continuing, all amounts payable under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable.
714603_17_ITEM8_P135_S1	The Credit Facility also contains customary restrictive covenants and cross-default provisions.
714603_17_ITEM8_P135_S2	The maturity date for the Credit Facility is October 1, 2019.
714603_17_ITEM8_P135_S3	Amounts borrowed on the Credit Facility were $75.0 million and $226.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P135_S4	We have various unsecured revolving lines of credit to support our consolidated subsidiaries operations that provide total borrowings of up to $25.0 million .
714603_17_ITEM8_P135_S5	Borrowings on these lines of credit are available at variable rates of interest based on the LIBOR or the bank s Prime rate and mature during 2017.
714603_17_ITEM8_P135_S6	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , there were no borrowings under any of these lines of credit.
714603_17_ITEM8_P135_S7	During the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , total proceeds from our revolving credit facilities were approximately $977.1 million , $1,053.6 million and $929.8 million , respectively, and total repayments were approximately $1,128.2 million , $871.8 million and $895.9 million respectively, which comprise the net cash flows presented within the financing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	Senior notes During 2010, we issued $370.0 million of aggregate principal of privately placed senior notes (collectively, the Senior Notes ) pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated August 9, 2010 (the Agreement ).
714603_17_ITEM8_P136_S1	The Senior Notes are comprised of $40.0 million of 4.19% Series A Senior Notes due August 9, 2015, $105.0 million of 4.86% Series B Senior Notes due August 9, 2017, $65.0 million of 5.06% Series C Senior Notes due August 9, 2018 and $160.0 million of 5.42% Series D Senior Notes due August 9, 2020.

714603_17_ITEM8_P136_S3	Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in February and August of each year.
714603_17_ITEM8_P136_S4	We may prepay the Senior Notes at any time, in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole prepayment premium.
714603_17_ITEM8_P136_S5	Pursuant to the Agreement, any Company subsidiary required to become a party to or otherwise guarantee the syndicated line of credit facility or other indebtedness in excess of $100.0 million , must also guarantee our obligations under the Senior Notes.
714603_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	The Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants, as well as certain customary events of default, including cross-default provisions.
714603_17_ITEM8_P137_S1	Among other provisions, the Agreement limits our ability to incur or create liens, sell assets, issue priority indebtedness and change lines of business.
714603_17_ITEM8_P137_S2	The Agreement also requires certain leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	Related party credit agreements We acquired certain intangible assets in 2011 from BFDS in exchange for an installment loan that was payable over five years.
714603_17_ITEM8_P138_S1	The loan was repaid during 2016.
714603_17_ITEM8_P138_S2	The amount outstanding at December 31, 2015 was $1.5 million .
714603_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	Other indebtedness We had other indebtedness, which was primarily comprised of debt assumed in a 2006 business acquisition.
714603_17_ITEM8_P139_S1	The debt assumed was repaid during 2016.
714603_17_ITEM8_P139_S2	The amount outstanding at December 31, 2015 was $3.4 million and was payable in monthly installments with a fixed interest rate of 5.6% .
714603_17_ITEM8_P139_S3	Future principal payments of indebtedness at December 31, 2016 are as follows (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	The weighted average interest rates on our short-term borrowings were 2.36% and 1.67% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P140_S1	Based upon the borrowing rates currently available to us for indebtedness with similar terms and average maturities, the carrying value of long-term debt, with the exception of the Senior Notes, is considered to approximate fair value at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM8_P140_S2	The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes was derived principally from quoted prices (level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).
714603_17_ITEM8_P140_S3	The carrying and fair value of the Senior Notes were as follows (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions.
714603_17_ITEM8_P141_S1	When determined appropriate, we use derivative instruments as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks.
714603_17_ITEM8_P141_S2	The primary market risks managed by us through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk.
714603_17_ITEM8_P141_S3	We may use various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts, option contracts and swaps.
714603_17_ITEM8_P141_S4	We do not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes.
714603_17_ITEM8_P141_S5	We determine the fair values of our derivatives based on quoted market prices that are directly or indirectly observable as further described within Note 7 , Fair Value Measurements .
714603_17_ITEM8_P141_S6	The fair value of our derivative instruments is reflected on a gross, rather than net, basis and is not significant to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016 or 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	Cash flow hedging strategy We use cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.
714603_17_ITEM8_P142_S1	The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) and are reclassified into the line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.
714603_17_ITEM8_P142_S2	The changes in fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings.
714603_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	The length of time for which we hedge our exposure to future cash flows is typically one to two years.
714603_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	We have entered into a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our net cash outflows from intercompany purchases of services from our international subsidiaries could be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
714603_17_ITEM8_P144_S1	We entered into forward foreign currency contracts (Thai baht) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies.
714603_17_ITEM8_P144_S2	The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for our foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $14.3 million and $13.5 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P145_S0	We monitor the mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly.
714603_17_ITEM8_P145_S1	From time to time, we manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments.
714603_17_ITEM8_P145_S2	We have not entered into interest rate swap agreements during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM8_P145_S3	The pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on AOCI and earnings was not significant during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 .
714603_17_ITEM8_P145_S4	There were no gains or losses recognized into income as a result of hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .
714603_17_ITEM8_P145_S5	As of December 31, 2016 , we estimate that amounts to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months are $0.1 million .
714603_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	In addition to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, we also use certain derivatives as economic hedges of foreign currency exposure.
714603_17_ITEM8_P146_S1	Although these derivatives were not designated for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges.
714603_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	The changes in fair values of economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.
714603_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	We use foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on certain intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies, primarily the British pound and Australian dollar.
714603_17_ITEM8_P149_S0	The foreign currency economic hedging program consists of rolling, monthly forward foreign currency contracts which settle on the last day of each month.
714603_17_ITEM8_P149_S1	As a result, there are minimal unrealized gains or losses at the end of the period related to these contracts.
714603_17_ITEM8_P149_S2	The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency economic hedges were $91.6 million and $125.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P150_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse.
714603_17_ITEM8_P151_S0	Deferred tax expense (benefit) is generally the result of changes in the assets or liabilities for deferred taxes.
714603_17_ITEM8_P151_S1	The following summarizes pretax income from continuing operations (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM8_P152_S0	Provision for income taxes (benefits) from continuing operations consists of the following components (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM8_P153_S0	Following are the reconciliations of our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal income tax statutory rate (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM8_P154_S0	The federal and state deferred tax assets (liabilities) recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM8_P155_S0	We have approximately $10.8 million of federal net operating losses as of December 31, 2016 as a result of prior year business combinations.
714603_17_ITEM8_P155_S1	These net operating losses begin to expire in 2028 and are available to reduce future income taxes.
714603_17_ITEM8_P155_S2	Since these net operating losses were generated by an entity prior to its acquisition by DST, our utilization is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
714603_17_ITEM8_P155_S3	We do not anticipate that such limitations will prohibit the utilization of the federal net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration.
714603_17_ITEM8_P155_S4	We have approximately $49.5 million of state net operating losses as of December 31, 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM8_P155_S5	These net operating losses begin to expire in 2023.
714603_17_ITEM8_P155_S6	We have approximately $0.7 million and $9.3 million of net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2016 in Canada and the U.K., respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P155_S7	The Canada carryforwards begin to expire in 2032.
714603_17_ITEM8_P156_S0	The U.K. carryforwards do not expire but their utilization may be limited to offset only income with certain characteristics.
714603_17_ITEM8_P157_S0	A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
714603_17_ITEM8_P157_S1	In evaluating the realizability of certain international net deferred tax assets, we also anticipate that limitations may result in the benefit of these amounts not being realized and have established corresponding valuation allowances as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 of $5.7 million and $10.5 million , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P157_S2	In evaluating certain state net operating losses, we anticipate that limitations may result in the benefit of these amounts not being realized and have established a corresponding valuation allowance of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2016 .
714603_17_ITEM8_P158_S0	We provide deferred taxes for unremitted earnings of U.S. unconsolidated affiliates net of the 80% dividends received deduction provided for under current tax law.
714603_17_ITEM8_P158_S1	Through December 31, 2016 , the cumulative amount of such unremitted earnings was $91.9 million .
714603_17_ITEM8_P158_S2	These amounts would become taxable to us if distributed by the affiliates as dividends, in which case we would be entitled to the dividends received deduction for 80% of the dividends; alternatively, these earnings could be realized by the sale of the affiliates stock, which would give rise to tax at federal capital gains rates and state ordinary income tax rates, to the extent the stock sale proceeds exceeded our tax basis.
714603_17_ITEM8_P158_S3	Deferred taxes provided on unremitted earnings through December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $6.5 million and $6.0 million , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P158_S4	We record U.S. tax on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Distributions in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 resulted in incremental taxes of $1.0 million , $1.9 million and $0.7 million , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P158_S5	We recorded approximately $2.6 million and $2.7 million of related income tax liability, net of credits, on unremitted earnings in 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P158_S6	We intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings in the businesses of our other foreign subsidiaries.
714603_17_ITEM8_P158_S7	As a consequence, no federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided for amounts which would become payable, if any, on the distribution of such earnings.
714603_17_ITEM8_P158_S8	In the event of such a distribution, we may be able to offset, at least in part, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such a distribution with foreign income tax credits which would become creditable as a result of such a distribution.
714603_17_ITEM8_P159_S0	U.S., the tax laws in effect at that time, as well as the ability of the Company to claim foreign tax credits, it is not practicable for us to determine the income tax we would incur, if any, if such earnings were distributed.
714603_17_ITEM8_P159_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , accumulated undistributed earnings considered permanently reinvested were $113.6 million , which is inclusive of discontinued operations.
714603_17_ITEM8_P159_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM8_P160_S0	Included in the net unrecognized tax benefit at December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were $40.9 million , $42.0 million and $51.8 million , respectively, of tax positions which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
714603_17_ITEM8_P160_S1	We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes, which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods.
714603_17_ITEM8_P160_S2	The liability for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits decreased $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $10.4 million .
714603_17_ITEM8_P160_S3	The liability for interest and penalties increased $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM8_P160_S4	Although it is difficult to predict when all uncertain tax positions will reverse due to the unknown timing of the completion of examination periods, it is possible that aggregate income tax amounts of approximately $10.0 million to $13.0 million may reverse during 2017.
714603_17_ITEM8_P161_S0	We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
714603_17_ITEM8_P161_S1	An IRS examination for the tax year ended December 31, 2010 was completed in September 2015.
714603_17_ITEM8_P161_S2	Federal tax years 2011 through 2016 are subject to examination while various years from 2007 through 2016 are under or are subject to various state, local, and foreign income tax examinations by taxing authorities.
714603_17_ITEM8_P162_S0	We do not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on our financial statements.
714603_17_ITEM8_P163_S0	During 2015, the IRS completed its examination of the previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions, research and experimentation credits and capital losses for the period 2010.
714603_17_ITEM8_P163_S1	As a result, during 2015 we recognized income tax benefits of $11.9 million , resulting from the reversal of previously reserved tax positions related to these matters as well as other remeasurements during the period.
714603_17_ITEM8_P163_S2	An IRS examination for the tax year ended December 31, 2014 is expected to begin during 2017.
714603_17_ITEM8_P164_S0	Equity Earnings per share The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):
714603_17_ITEM8_P165_S0	We had approximately 32.0 million and 34.3 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
714603_17_ITEM8_P165_S1	There were no shares from options to purchase common stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
714603_17_ITEM8_P166_S0	We have authorized 10.0 million shares of preferred stock, of which no shares are currently issued or outstanding.
714603_17_ITEM8_P166_S1	Other comprehensive income (loss) AOCI balances, net of tax consist of the following (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM8_P167_S0	Additions to and reclassifications out of AOCI attributable to the Company (in millions):
714603_17_ITEM8_P168_S0	(1) Realized (gains)/losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized in Other income, net.
714603_17_ITEM8_P168_S1	(2) Reclassification to net earnings of derivatives qualifying as effective foreign currency cash flow hedges are recognized in Costs and expenses.

714603_17_ITEM8_P168_S5	The unconsolidated affiliate used inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are directly or indirectly observable relating to the measurement of the interest rate swap.

714603_17_ITEM8_P170_S1	In connection with this share repurchase, we recorded a non-cash gain of $18.1 million during 2014 resulting from the change in stock price between the date the share repurchase price became fixed and the settlement date.

714603_17_ITEM8_P176_S1	Grants of restricted stock are valued at the date of grant based on the value of DST s common stock and are expensed using the straight-line method over the service period or, in the case of performance based vesting awards, over the expected period to achieve the required performance criteria.
714603_17_ITEM8_P176_S2	Except for restrictions placed on the transferability of the restricted stock, holders of RSAs have full stockholders rights during the term of restriction, including voting rights and the right to receive cash dividends, if any.
714603_17_ITEM8_P176_S3	Grants of RSUs do not confer full stockholder rights such as voting rights and cash dividends, but provide for additional dividend equivalent RSU awards in lieu of cash dividends.
714603_17_ITEM8_P177_S0	Unvested shares of restricted stock may be forfeited upon termination of employment with the Company depending on the circumstances of the termination, or failure to achieve the required performance condition, if applicable.

714603_17_ITEM8_P179_S3	Future compensation expense is not projected on approximately $46.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense as the related awards are not currently expected to achieve their required performance features and therefore are not expected to vest.

714603_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Trends or events affecting our clients or their industries could decrease the demand for our products and services and the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our significant clients could materially harm our business and results of operations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We derive our revenues from the delivery of products and services to clients primarily in the mutual fund, brokerage, investment management, other financial service (e.g., insurance, banking and financial planning), healthcare and pharmacy industries.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Demand for our products and services among companies in those industries could decline for many reasons.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If demand for our products or services decreases or any of the industries we serve decline or fail or consolidate, reducing the number of potential clients, our business and our operating results could be adversely affected.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	On a consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2017 , our five largest clients accounted for approximately 23.7% of our consolidated operating revenues.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	For the same period, the Healthcare Services segment s five largest clients accounted for approximately 48.7% of our revenues in that segment, including 18.6% from its largest clients.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Because of our significant client concentration, particularly in the Healthcare Services segment, our revenues could fluctuate significantly due to changes in economic conditions, the use of competitive products, or the loss of, reduction of business with, or less favorable terms with any of our significant clients, and a delay or default in payment by any significant client could materially harm our business and results of operations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Events that adversely affect our clients businesses, rates of growth or numbers of clients they serve could decrease demand for our products and services and the number of transactions we process.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Events that could adversely affect our clients businesses include decreased demand for our clients products and services, adverse conditions in our clients markets or adverse economic conditions generally.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P1_S8	We may be unsuccessful in predicting the needs of changing industries and whether potential clients will accept our products or services.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P1_S9	We also may invest in technology or infrastructure for specific clients and not realize additional revenue from such investments.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P1_S10	If trends or events do not occur as we expect, our business could be negatively impacted.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or those of third parties on which we rely could result in significant costs and reputational damage.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have developed and maintained, and our businesses depend on, information technology, including elements both internal and external, to record and process a large volume of complex transactions and other data, including personally identifiable information regarding financial and health matters.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In certain circumstances, vendors have access to such data in order to assist us with responsibilities, such as producing benefit plan identification cards, maintaining software we license on our own behalf or for resell to others, or helping clients comply with anti-money laundering regulations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Any interruptions, delays, breakdowns, or breach, including as a result of cybersecurity breaches or breaches of our environments and procedures or those of our vendors, could result in significant data losses or theft of our or our clients intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Several health care and financial services firms have been victims of computer systems hacking attacks, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data, and reputational harm.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Rapid advances in technology, and the limits and costs of technology, skills and manpower, may prevent us from anticipating, identifying, preventing or addressing all potential security threats and breaches.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	A cybersecurity breach involving our systems or those of third parties on which we rely could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues, regulatory penalties, and litigation.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The demand for our products and services could decrease if we do not continually address our clients technology and capacity requirements.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our clients use technology-based products and services in the complex and rapidly changing markets in which they operate.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our processes to support the design, set-up, quality assurance, and maintenance activities for the timely implementation of new client services, migration of existing clients onto new or different platforms, and ongoing servicing may not meet the needs of our business and clients.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We must substantially invest in technology and systems to meet client requirements for technology and capacity.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If we do not meet clients technology and capacity requirements in advance of our competitors or if the investments we make are not cost-effective or do not result in successful products or services, our business could be adversely affected.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	The success of our information technology transformation initiative will depend on the timing, extent and cost of implementation; performance of third-parties; upgrade requirements; and availability and reliability of the various technologies required to provide such transformation.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We must continually invest in our information technology in order to continually meet our clients needs.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	We are implementing a multi-year information technology transformation initiative intended to reduce operating costs, increase information security, upgrade infrastructure, expand automation, provide access to emerging technologies and position us to take advantage of market opportunities.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P6_S7	If we fail to provide an enhanced client experience with this initiative, our ability to retain and attract clients and to maintain and grow revenues could be adversely affected.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Using new and sophisticated technology on a very large scale entails risks.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	For example, deployment of new software may adversely affect the performance of existing services on our existing platforms and decrease the client experience.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If implementation of our information technology transformation initiative results in delayed services or costs of the initiative exceed expected amounts, our margins could be adversely affected and such effects could be material.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If the delivery of services expected to be deployed on modernized architecture were delayed due to technological constraints, performance of third-party suppliers, or other reasons, the cost of providing such services could become higher than expected, which could result in higher costs to clients, potentially resulting in decisions to purchase services from our competitors, which would adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flow from operations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our business strategy anticipates that we will supplement internal growth by pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We may be unable to identify suitable businesses to acquire.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other complementary businesses.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Information we obtain about an acquisition target may be limited and there can be no assurance that an acquisition will perform as expected or positively impact our financial performance.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Potential acquisitions involve risk, including the risk we would be unable to effectively integrate the acquired technologies, operations and personnel into our business, and the risk that management s attention and our capital would be diverted from other areas of our business.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P8_S6	The anticipated benefits of our acquisitions may not materialize.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the issuance of capital stock, incurrence or assumption of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P8_S8	If we cannot complete acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In addition, we have divested, and may in the future divest, businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These divestitures similarly require a significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt our business, distract management from other responsibilities and may result in continued responsibility for the divested business, including through indemnification, for a period of time following the transaction, which could adversely affect our financial results.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If our new investments and business initiatives are not successful, our financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We have invested, and continue to invest heavily in our technology to improve existing products and services and add new products and services to address the needs of existing or new clients.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our investments may not lead to successful deployment or increases in the number of accounts or transactions.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If we are not successful in creating value from our investments by increasing sales or reducing expenses, our financial condition and prospects could be harmed.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	An increase in subaccounting services performed by brokerage firms has and will continue to adversely impact our revenues.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We service open-end and closed-end funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, interval funds and exchange-listed closed-end funds, as well as private funds, collective investment trusts and other accounts under shareowner recordkeeping arrangements which we refer to as registered accounts.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	These arrangements are distinguished from broker subaccounts, which are serviced under contract with a broker/dealer.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our clients may adopt the broker subaccount structure.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We offer subaccounting services to brokerage firms that perform shareowner subaccounting.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	As the recordkeeping functions in connection with subaccounting are more limited than traditional shareowner accounting, the fees charged are generally lower on a per unit basis.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Brokerage firms that obtain agreements from our clients to use a broker subaccount structure cause accounts currently on our traditional recordkeeping system to convert to our subaccounting system, or to the subaccounting systems of other service providers, which generally results in lower revenues.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S6	While subaccounting conversions have generally been limited to our non tax-advantaged mutual fund accounts, such conversions have begun to extend to the tax-advantaged accounts (such as retirement and Section 529 accounts) we service, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Consolidation in or among our clients and potential clients could result in a reduction of clients or reduction in use of our products or services.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Mergers or acquisitions of or consolidations among our clients or between our clients and other entities could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients and result in the discontinuation or reduction in use of our products or services.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S9	This could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of clients or the activities of the consolidated entities.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S11	Our businesses are subject to substantial competition.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S12	We are subject to intense competition from other established service providers in all industries we serve.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S13	Some of our competitors are able to bundle service offerings and offer more appealing pricing structures.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S14	Some of our clients, or the clients they serve, may develop, have developed or are developing the in-house capacity to perform the transaction processing and recordkeeping services they have paid us to perform.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S15	Additionally, some of our competitors and clients have greater financial and human resources and access to capital than we do.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S16	In the financial and healthcare markets we serve, we compete based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the range of products or services offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, stability and continuity of client and other intermediary relationships, quality of service, and level of fees charged for products and services.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S17	We continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products and services offered.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S18	Our failure to successfully compete in any of our material operating businesses could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P11_S19	Competition could also affect the revenue mix of products or services we provide, resulting in decreased revenues in lines of business with higher profit margins.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may not be able to sustain critical operations and provide essential products and services during system failures or catastrophic events.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Damage to our systems or facilities or those of third parties on which we rely could impact our operations or financial condition.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The performance of our services also depends upon facilities that house central computer operations or operating centers, including facilities provided by third parties on which we rely.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Significant damage to any of our operating facilities or those of third parties on which we rely could interrupt the operations at those facilities and interfere with our ability to serve clients.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Moreover, in the event of a catastrophic event we may not be able to execute our business resumption strategies for data processing and capabilities, and we may not have the ability to recover critical data, programs, applications, and data processing capabilities in a timely manner; any of these could impact our ability to serve our clients.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	In addition, it is possible that hardware failures or errors or technical deficiencies in our systems or those of third parties on which we rely could similarly result in data loss or corruption.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Any failure of our systems or facilities or those of third parties on which we rely could expose us to liability and damages relating to such failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We operate internationally and are thus exposed to currency fluctuations and foreign political, economic and other conditions that could adversely affect our revenues from or support by foreign operations .
714603_18_ITEM1A_P12_S8	Inherent risks in our international business activities could decrease our international sales and also could adversely affect our ability to receive important support from our international operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P12_S9	These risks include potentially unfavorable foreign economic conditions, political conditions or national priorities, foreign government regulation, potential expropriation of assets by foreign governments, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, the failure to bridge cultural differences, and limited or prohibited access to our foreign operations and the support they provide.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P12_S10	We may also have difficulty repatriating any profits or be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in our international business.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As a result of the December 2016 referendum in the U.K. to exit the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit ), the value of the British pound has fluctuated greatly as compared to the US dollar.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The relative strengthening of the dollar relative to the British pound may adversely affect our revenues and operating results.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Any withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union could significantly disrupt the movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the European Union; the financial services industry could be particularly sensitive to Brexit and it could result in increased legal and regulatory complexities for our operations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	There can be no assurance that these disruptions and regulatory changes would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Various events may cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The nature of these events might inhibit our ability to anticipate and act in advance to counter them.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We may be unsuccessful in determining or controlling when and whether events occur that could cause varying financial results.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Unfavorable results may occur that we did not anticipate or take advance action to address.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We incur significant costs to develop products and services used to service our existing and potential client operations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	The timing of these expenses may fluctuate as new client contracts are signed or existing client contracts are renewed or terminated, causing our results to vary accordingly.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Factors contributing to the variability of our results include increased costs of supplies, increased costs relating to existing and potential client operations, and hiring staff to develop new and existing products.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S7	The timing of our fees associated with new and existing client contracts, including changes in recognition as a result of changes in accounting principles, may also cause results to vary from period to period.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S9	We generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn for our products and services.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S10	These revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S11	The number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets, which are impacted by market prices and the liquidity of the securities markets, among other factors.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S12	We could continue to be negatively impacted by the volatile markets as certain of our fees are tied to the asset bases of our clients.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S13	The occurrence of significant market volatility or decreased levels of participation would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S14	Additionally, we may be exposed to operational or other risks in connection with any systematic failures in the markets, or the default due to market-related failures of one or more counterparties with whom we transact.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S15	We also derive significant revenues from asset management, administration and distribution contracts with clients.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S16	Under these contracts, the fees paid to us are based on a variety of factors, including the market value of assets under management ( AUM ), assets under administration ( AUA ) and number of transactions processed.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P14_S17	AUM, AUA or the number of transactions processed may decline for various reasons, causing results to vary.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	(and therefore revenues) include declines in the market value of the assets in the funds (and accounts as applicable) managed, administered and distributed, redemptions and other withdrawals from, or shifts among, the funds (and accounts as applicable) managed, administered and distributed, as well as market conditions generally.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our revenues may decrease due to changes in asset management, administration and distribution fees and industry trends.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The asset management, administration and distribution business is highly competitive and we compete for investors and clients on the basis of factors such as performance, reputation, service, and cost.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Underperformance of any of our proprietary and client products and services, damage to our reputation, or service-related issues could lead to redemptions or terminations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Additionally, the asset management industry has generally been subject to fee compression and asset flows to lower cost products or services.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Such a trend may result in fee compression in asset management, administration and distribution related contracts.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P15_S6	The asset management, administration and distribution contracts may be terminated by the parties thereto, and the board of directors or trustees of certain funds may terminate investment management, administration and distribution agreements for any reason and without penalty.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The factors and trends described above could have a material adverse effect on revenues.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Investment decisions with respect to cash balances, market returns or losses on investments, and limits on insurance applicable to cash balances held in bank and brokerage accounts, including those held by us and as agent on behalf of our clients, could expose us to losses of such cash balances and adversely affect revenues attributable to cash balance deposit investments.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As part of our transaction processing and other services, we maintain and manage large bank and investment accounts containing client funds, which we hold as agent, as well as operational funds.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our revenues include investment earnings related to client fund cash balances.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Our choices in selecting investments, or market conditions that affect the rate of return on or the availability of investments, could have an adverse effect on the level of such revenues.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The amounts held in our operational and client deposit accounts could exceed the limits of government insurance programs of organizations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation, exposing us to the risk of loss.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Any substantial loss would have an adverse impact on our business and our financial condition.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Operational errors in the performance of our services or contractual obligations, as well as unknown or undetected defects, could lead to liability for claims, client loss and result in reputational damage.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	The failure to properly perform our services or contractual obligations could result in our clients and/or certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to losses including censures, fines, or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Despite testing, defects or errors may occur in our existing or new services, which could cause us to compromise client data, lose revenues, lose clients, divert development resources, or damage our reputation, any of which could harm our business.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Our revenues could decrease if client contracts are terminated or fail to renew or if clients renegotiate contracts or utilize our services at lower than anticipated levels.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We derive most of our revenue by selling products and services under multi-year contracts, many of which contain terms and conditions based on anticipated levels of utilization of our services.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We cannot unilaterally extend the terms of our client contracts when they expire.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Contracts can terminate during the term of agreement for various reasons, including through termination for convenience clauses in some contracts that enable clients to cancel by written notice.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our revenues could decrease as a result of terminations or non-renewals of client contracts; extensions of client contracts under, or contract re-negotiations resulting in, less favorable terms; or utilization of services at less than anticipated levels.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We are substantially dependent on our intellectual property rights, and a claim for infringement or a requirement to indemnify a client for infringement could adversely affect us.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	We have made substantial investments in software and other intellectual property on which our business is highly dependent.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Businesses we acquire also often depend on intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and, ultimately, our business.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the U.S. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	To the extent available, we rely on patent, trade secret and copyright laws; however, significant portions of our proprietary intellectual property are not protected by patents.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We also utilize nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and security measures to protect our proprietary technology.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We cannot guarantee these measures will be effective.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our products and services rely on technology developed by others, including open source software, and we have no control over possible infringement of someone else s intellectual property rights by the provider of this technology.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The owner of the rights could seek damages from us rather than or in addition to the persons who provide the technology to us.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We could be subject at any time to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to evaluate and defend.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Our clients may also face infringement claims, allege that such claims relate to our products and services, and seek indemnification from us.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Any loss of our intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights of others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Our investments in funds and our joint ventures could decline in value.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S9	From time to time we add new investment strategies to our investment product offerings by providing the initial cash investments as seed capital.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S10	The seed capital investments may decline in value.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P19_S11	A significant decline in their value could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We are a limited partner in various private equity funds and have future capital commitments related to certain private equity fund investments.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Generally, private equity fund securities are non-transferable or are subject to long holding periods, and withdrawals from the private equity firm partnerships are typically not permitted.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Even when transfer restrictions do not apply, there is generally no public market for the securities.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Therefore, we may not be able to sell the securities at a time when we desire to do so.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We may not always be able to sell those investments at the same or higher prices than we paid for them.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	We also participate in joint ventures with other companies.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P20_S6	These joint venture investments could require further capital contributions.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We have restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If we do not comply with these restrictive covenants, our failure could result in material and adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary investments, and asset dispositions, and require us to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in reduced liquidity for the Company and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our debt agreements could result in a cross default under one or more of our other debt agreements, including our financing agreements.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	This would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operation.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Regulatory and Litigation Risks We and our unconsolidated affiliates are subject to regulation.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Any regulatory violations, changes or uncertainties could adversely affect our business.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S8	A number of our businesses are subject to U.S. or foreign regulation, including privacy, licensing, processing, recordkeeping, investment adviser, broker/dealer, retirement, data protection, reporting and related regulations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S9	New products and services we plan to offer may also be subject to regulation, either directly or as a downstream provider to customers or clients.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Such regulations cover all aspects of our businesses including, but not limited to, sales and trading methods, trade practices among broker/dealers, use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities, use of client and employee data, capital structure of securities firms, net capital, anti-money laundering efforts, healthcare, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Any violation of applicable regulations could expose us or those businesses to civil or criminal liability, significant fines or sanctions, damage our reputation, the revocation of licenses, censures, or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, which could adversely affect our business or our financial results.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Governmental changes, changing interpretation of regulations, and uncertainties surrounding services we provide could increase our costs of business, result in penalties, or diminish business, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S13	The SEC or other regulatory agencies may issue regulations impacting mutual fund service providers, which could adversely affect our business.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P21_S14	The Department of Labor ( DOL ) issued fiduciary regulations in 2016 that, if not delayed, repealed or substantially altered in the near future, are likely to impact our business.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The SEC may issue additional regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Dodd-Frank Act ) or other legislative authority that would require brokers and financial intermediaries that distribute mutual funds to make more detailed fee disclosures at the point-of-sale.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Additionally, many brokers and financial intermediaries have become subject to a new DOL-imposed fiduciary standard-of-care that is causing them to review, and may impact, their methods of distribution, share class structures, and/or wholesaling activities.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Although the DOL rule is fully effective, the current administration has delayed implementation of the best interest contract exemption, providing an extended transition period for distributors to address their new fiduciary status.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	It remains unclear whether the regulations will be replaced by an SEC standard, repealed or substantially altered within the near future.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We cannot predict all of the requirements the SEC or FINRA may impose.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Additionally, we cannot predict whether the SEC or FINRA proposal will provide a unified standard with the DOL rule, or whether it will provide a patchwork of standards that depend on the type of account in which the retirement assets are invested.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Additionally, while the industry would prefer a united federal fiduciary standard, individual states such as Nevada, New York and Maryland have recently begun to explore their own legislative options to provide a fiduciary standard for investment advice.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Regulations that cause current distribution channels or interest in mutual fund investing to change could decrease the number of accounts on our systems as a result of changes in client offerings or the attractiveness of offerings to customers of our clients.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The fiduciary regulations are expected to primarily impact brokers and registered investment advisers who give individualized non-discretionary advice in the retail marketplace, but discretionary investment managers in the institutional space are also expected to be affected, primarily in connection with the sale of investment products and services.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	To the extent that our business units, clients, unaffiliated intermediary partners and retirement plan service providers fit into these categories, this could adversely affect our business and operating results.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Additionally, to the extent the Dodd-Frank Act and/or DOL regulations impact the operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business, those institutions may seek to pass through increased costs to us or they may reduce their transactional volume which is a primary source of our revenues.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Our clients are subject to regulation that could affect our business.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Our clients are subject to extensive regulation, including investment adviser, broker/dealer and privacy regulations applicable to products and services we provide to the financial services industry and insurance, privacy and other regulations applicable to services we provide to the healthcare industry.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Changes in, and any violation by our clients of, applicable laws and regulations (whether related to the products and services we provide or otherwise) could diminish their business or financial condition and thus their demand for our products and services or could increase our cost of continuing to provide our products and services to such industries.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Demand could also decrease if we do not continue to offer products and services that help our clients comply with regulations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S8	For example, our accounts in our Healthcare Services segment are impacted by the Affordable Care Act, including the Health Insurance Marketplace.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S9	Changes to the Affordable Care Act may be enacted by Congress in response to the current administration s stated agenda, and we cannot predict the impact that will have on our clients and their demand for our products and services.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S10	Our businesses expose us to risks of claims and losses that could be significant and damage our reputation and business prospects.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S11	Our proprietary applications and related consulting and other services include the processing or clearing of financial and healthcare transactions for our clients and their customers and the design of benefit plans and compliance programs.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S12	The dollar amount of transactions processed or cleared is vastly higher than the revenues we derive from providing these services.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S13	In the event we make transaction processing or operational errors, or mismanage any process, we could be exposed to claims for any resulting processing delays, disclosure of protected information, miscalculations, mishandling of pass-through disbursements or other processes, and failure to follow a client s instructions or meet specifications.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S14	Additionally, we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from a failure of third parties (including regulatory authorities) to recognize the limitations of our role as our clients agent or consultant, and we may be subject to claims or liability resulting from fraud committed by third parties.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S15	We may be exposed to the risk of counterparty breaches or failure to perform.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S16	We may be subject to claims, including class actions, for reimbursements, losses or damages arising from any transaction processing or operational error, or from process mismanagement.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P24_S17	Because of the sensitive nature of the financial and healthcare transactions we process, our liability and any alleged damages may significantly exceed the fees we receive for performing the service at issue.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Litigation could include class action claims based upon, among other theories, various regulatory requirements and consumer protection and privacy laws that class action plaintiffs may attempt to use to assert private rights of action.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Any of these claims and related settlements or judgments could affect our operating results, damage our reputation, decrease demand for our products and services, or cause us to make costly operating changes.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Changes in tax laws, including the recently enacted federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( Tax Act ), as well as other factors, could cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate in 2018 and thereafter.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in federal and various state jurisdictions.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We are currently evaluating the Tax Act with our professional advisers.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We have recognized the provisional tax impacts, based on reasonable estimates, related to the one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of undistributed accumulated foreign earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and have included these amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	In addition, because of the uncertainties relating to the future application of the Tax Act and actions we may take in the future, the effect of the Tax Act on us in 2018 and future years may change significantly and cannot be predicted.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are subject to audits by tax authorities from time to time in federal and state jurisdictions.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and penalties.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our results of operations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We do not control certain businesses in which we have significant ownership.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We invest in joint ventures and other unconsolidated affiliates as part of our business strategy, and part of our net income is derived from our pro rata share of the earnings of those businesses.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Despite owning significant equity interests in those companies and having directors on their boards, we do not control their operations, strategies or financial decisions.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	The other owners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the businesses we co-own.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Our pro rata share of any losses due to unfavorable performance of those companies could negatively impact our financial results.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Some of our joint venture investments are subject to buy-sell agreements, which could, among other things, restrict us from selling our interests even if we were to determine it would be prudent to do so.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S6	We own interests in unconsolidated entities and various real estate joint ventures.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S7	Our interests in such unconsolidated entities are subject to buy/sell arrangements, which could restrict our ability to sell our interests even if we were to determine it would be prudent to do so.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S8	These arrangements could also allow us to purchase the other owners interests to prevent someone else from acquiring them and we cannot control the timing of occasions to do so.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S9	The businesses or other owners may encourage us to increase our investment in or make contributions to the businesses at an inopportune time.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S10	In addition, some of the agreements governing our joint venture arrangements include buy/sell provisions that provide a party to the arrangement with the option to purchase the other party s interests upon such other party s change of control at a purchase price that may be less than fair market value.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S11	For instance, consummation of the proposed Merger would constitute a change of control of the Company under the partnership agreement of IFDS L.P. and, as a result, the other partner would have the option to purchase our interests in IFDS L.P. at a price equal to book value, unless another purchase provision in the partnership agreement was triggered prior to the change of control.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S12	Book value may be substantially less than fair market value at the time of any sale of our interests upon a change of control.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P29_S13	Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, certain plans and agreements, and applicable laws could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	legal restrictions on business combinations with certain stockholders.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Because of contractual commitments, a change in control could affect our operating results and weaken our management retention and incentive tools.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	A change in control of the Company could trigger various rights and obligations in service agreements with certain clients and other agreements.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	A change in control could also allow some clients to terminate their agreements with us or to obtain rights to use our processing software.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Under certain executive equity-based and other incentive compensation awards, benefit programs and employment agreements with our management, a change in control by itself, or an individual s termination of employment without cause or resignation for good reason (each as defined in applicable agreements) after a change in control could accelerate funding, payment or vesting of equity grants, as applicable, under such agreements and programs.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	This accelerated funding, vesting or payment may decrease an employee s incentive to continue employment with us.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We have adopted an executive severance plan which, among other things, provides benefits to participating senior officers and executives who are terminated in connection with a change of control.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Certain other executive officers have agreements with us that require us to continue to employ them for three years after a change in control or to pay certain amounts if we terminate their employment without cause or they resign for good reason following a change in control.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P31_S7	The executives might not be incented to achieve desired results for the new owners of our business, and the cost of keeping the executives on the payroll might deter potential new owners from acquiring us or hinder new owners from hiring replacement management.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P31_S8	We may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P31_S9	Future cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Payment of dividends is subject to applicable laws and to restrictions in applicable debt agreements.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We are currently precluded from declaring dividends pursuant to the definitive Merger Agreement with SS C, as further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Description of Business.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The consummation of the Merger is subject to many conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not be completed.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We cannot provide any assurance that the Merger will be completed or that there will not be a delay in the completion of the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our ability to consummate the Merger is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks that the conditions to the Merger are not satisfied, or if possible, waived, including, among others, (a) receipt of the approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote (the Company Stockholder Approval (b) receipt of certain regulatory approvals; and (c) the absence of governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The process to obtain the requisite approvals could prevent, or substantially delay, the consummation of the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S4	The closing of the Merger is also dependent on the accuracy of representations and warranties made by the parties to the Merger Agreement (subject to customary materiality qualifiers and other customary exceptions), the performance in all material respects by the parties of obligations imposed under the Merger Agreement and the receipt of officer certificates by the other party certifying the satisfaction of the preceding conditions.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S5	We cannot provide any assurance as to whether or when the conditions to the closing of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or as to whether or when the Merger will be consummated.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that cannot be met.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Before the Merger may be completed, various approvals, authorizations and declarations of non-objection must be obtained from certain regulatory and governmental authorities.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S8	Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each party has agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other party in taking any and all actions, and to do all things reasonably necessary, appropriate or desirable, to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including obtaining any requisite approvals.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S9	These approvals include approval of, or under, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, approval under the competition law of Ireland and approvals of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, the Central Bank of Ireland and Luxembourg s Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S10	These regulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals and if such regulatory and governmental entities seek to impose such conditions, lengthy negotiations may ensue among such regulatory or governmental entities, SS C and DST.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P33_S11	Such conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger and such conditions may not be satisfied for an extended period of time.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the closing of the Merger not being satisfied.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The special meeting of our stockholders at which the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement will be considered may take place before all of the required regulatory approvals have been obtained and before regulatory remedies, if any, are known.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In this event, if the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, we and SS C may subsequently agree to regulatory remedies without further seeking stockholder approval, even if such regulatory remedies could have an adverse effect on us, SS C or the combined company, except as required by applicable law.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Merger Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to pursue other alternatives to the Merger and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay SS C a termination fee of $165.0 million.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The Merger Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative proposal.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Further, subject to limited exceptions, consistent with applicable law, the Merger Agreement provides that our Board of Directors will not fail to make, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to SS C, its recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of approving the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Although our Board of Directors is permitted to take certain actions in response to a superior proposal or an intervening event if it determines that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, doing so in specified situations could require us to pay SS C a termination fee.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P35_S4	There also is a risk that the requirement to pay the termination fee to SS C in certain circumstances may result in a potential acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger will not be completed.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The Merger Agreement may be terminated if the Merger is not consummated on or before July 11, 2018 (subject to extension to November 11, 2018 by either party if all conditions are satisfied other than regulatory approvals) or if the Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, SS C and DST may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances, including by SS C if DST s Board of Directors shall have changed its recommendation to stockholders and by DST in order to enter into an agreement providing for a superior proposal.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Upon a termination of the Merger Agreement due to entry into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, and as a result of DST s Board of Directors making a change of recommendation prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, we will be required to pay SS C a termination fee of $165.0 million.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Failure to consummate the Merger could negatively impact DST and our future operations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	If the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger is not consummated, our ongoing business may be adversely affected by a variety of factors.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S6	Our business may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities during the pendency of the Merger, (ii) payment of certain significant transaction costs relating to the Merger without receiving the anticipated benefits and (iii) the focus of our management on the Merger for an extended period of time rather than on other management opportunities or other beneficial opportunities for our Company.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S7	The market price of Company common stock may also decline as a result of any such failures to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S8	We may be negatively impacted if the Merger Agreement is terminated and DST seeks but is unable to find another business combination or strategic transaction offering equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided in the Merger, or if we become subject to litigation related to entering into or failing to consummate the Merger, including direct actions by our stockholders against the directors and/or officers for breaches of fiduciary duty or derivative actions brought by our stockholders.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S9	Furthermore, we may experience negative reactions from our stockholders, clients and employees in the event the Merger is not consummated.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S10	We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions until the Merger is consummated.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S11	Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on clients, counterparties to contracts, employees and other parties may have an adverse effect on us.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S12	These uncertainties could disrupt our business and cause clients, suppliers, vendors, partners and others that deal with us to defer entering into contracts with us or making other decisions concerning us or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S13	These uncertainties may also impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P36_S14	Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to completion of the Merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Merger Agreement restricts us, without the consent of SS C, from making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying dividends, and taking other specified actions until the earlier of the completion of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Furthermore, the preparation for the integration of the two companies may place a significant burden on management and internal resources.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect our financial results prior to and/or following the completion of the Merger and could limit us from pursuing attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Completion of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which DST is a party.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S5	The completion of the transactions may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which DST is a party.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S6	If SS C and DST are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Even if SS C and DST are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to DST.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S8	For example, consummation of the proposed Merger would constitute a change of control of the Company under the partnership agreement of IFDS L.P. and, as a result, the other partner would have the option to purchase our interests in IFDS L.P. at a price equal to book value, which may be substantially less than fair market value, unless another purchase provision in the partnership agreement was triggered prior to the change of control.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S9	We will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S10	We expect to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S11	A material portion of these expenses are payable by us whether or not the Merger is completed.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P37_S12	Further, while we have assumed that a certain amount of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	These expenses may exceed the costs historically borne by DST.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	These costs could adversely affect the financial condition and results of our operations prior to the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Any legal proceedings in connection with the Merger could delay or prevent the completion of the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Transactions such as the Merger often give rise to lawsuits by stockholders or other third parties.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no judgment, order, injunction, ruling or decree, preliminary, temporary or permanent, or other legal restraint or prohibition and no action, proceeding, binding order or determination by any governmental entity, will be in effect preventing or otherwise making illegal the consummation of the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In connection with the Merger, plaintiffs may file lawsuits against us and/or our directors and officers in connection with the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Such legal proceedings could also prevent or delay the completion of the Merger and result in additional costs.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In addition, if any lawsuit is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting us or SS C from consummating the Merger on the agreed upon terms, the injunction may prevent the Merger from being completed within the expected timeframe, or at all.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If the Merger is prevented or delayed, the lawsuits could result in substantial costs, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Merger is completed may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	We may waive one or more of the conditions to the Merger without resoliciting the Company Stockholder Approval.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P40_S6	We may determine to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions to our obligations to complete the Merger, to the extent permitted by applicable laws.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P40_S7	We will evaluate the materiality of any such waiver and its effect on our stockholders in light of the facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether any amendment of this proxy statement and resolicitation of proxies is required or warranted.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P40_S8	In some cases, if our Board determines that such a waiver is warranted but that such waiver or its effect on our stockholders is not sufficiently material to warrant resolicitation of proxies, we have the discretion to complete the Merger without seeking further stockholder approval.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P40_S9	Any determination whether to waive any condition to the Merger or as to resoliciting stockholder approval or amending this proxy statement as a result of a waiver will be made by us at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The opinion of our financial advisor will not reflect changes in circumstances between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We have not obtained an updated opinion in connection with the Merger from our financial advisor, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated ( BofA Merrill Lynch ), as of the date of this Form 10-K and do not expect to receive an updated opinion prior to the completion of the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Changes in our operations and prospects, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond our control, and on which the opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch was based, may significantly alter the value of our Company or the price of our common stock by the time the Merger is completed.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The opinion does not speak as of the time the Merger will be completed or as of any date other than the date of the opinion.
714603_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Because BofA Merrill Lynch will not be updating its opinion, which was issued in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 11, 2018, the opinion will not address the fairness of the Merger consideration from a financial point of view at the time the Merger is completed.
714603_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our businesses.
714603_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	At this time, we do not believe any material losses under these claims to be probable.
714603_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	While the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, it is in the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, that the final outcome in such proceedings, in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
714603_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table provides the quarterly high and low prices of, and quarterly cash dividends paid on, the Company s common stock for the two-year period ended December 31, 2017 .

714603_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	The prices set forth above do not include commissions and do not necessarily represent actual transactions.
714603_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	The closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2017 was $62.07 .
714603_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following table sets forth information with respect to shares of our common stock purchased by us during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 .
714603_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	_______________________________________________________________________ (1) For the three months ended December 31, 2017 , we purchased, in accordance with the 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan, 4,445 shares of our common stock for participant income tax withholding in conjunction with stock option exercises or from the vesting of restricted shares, as requested by the participants or from shares surrendered in satisfaction of the option exercise price.
714603_18_ITEM5_P2_S2	These purchases were not made under the publicly-announced repurchase plans or programs, but were allowed by the rules of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.
714603_18_ITEM5_P2_S3	Of these shares, 4,054 shares were purchased in October 2017 and 391 shares were purchased in December 2017 .
714603_18_ITEM5_P2_S4	(2) On May 9, 2017 our Board of Directors authorized a new $300.0 million share repurchase plan.
714603_18_ITEM5_P2_S5	The plan allows, but does not require, the repurchase of common stock in open market and private transactions.
714603_18_ITEM5_P2_S6	The plan does not have an expiration date.
714603_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	During 2017, we entered into one or more plans with our brokers or banks for pre-authorized purchases within defined limits pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 to affect all or a portion of such share repurchases.
714603_18_ITEM5_P3_S1	We are currently precluded from executing additional stock repurchases pursuant to the Merger Agreement with SS C, as further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Description of Business.
714603_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	Stock Performance Graph The following graph shows the changes in value since December 31, 2012 of an assumed investment of $100 in: (i) DST Common Stock; (ii) the stocks that comprise the S P MidCap 400 Index (1) ; and (iii) the stocks that comprise the S P MidCap 400 Index - Information Technology Sector (1) ( S P MidCap IT Index ).

714603_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	_______________________________________________________________________ (1) In 2017, we recorded a $43.8 million net gain on previously held equity interests and $159.8 million of net gains on securities and other investments, which are included in Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income primarily as a result of the acquisition of State Street s ownership in both BFDS and IFDS U.K.
714603_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	Additionally, as a result of a termination agreement reached with a wealth management platform client, operating revenues of $93.2 million related to previously deferred revenues and contractual termination payments received were recognized and bad debt expense, severance and other costs and expenses of $38.9 million were recorded in Costs and expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	In 2016, we acquired Kaufman Rossin Fund Services LLC.
714603_18_ITEM6_P1_S1	Additionally, we recorded net gains on securities and other investments of $16.3 million, which is included in Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_18_ITEM6_P1_S2	(3) In 2015, we acquired the following businesses: kasina LLC, Red Rocks Capital LLC and Wealth Management Systems Inc.
714603_18_ITEM6_P1_S3	Additionally, we recorded net gains on securities and other investments of $199.3 million, which is included in Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_18_ITEM6_P1_S4	(4) In 2014, we recorded a pretax gain of $100.5 million on the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary, DST Global Solutions, Ltd., which is included in Gain on sale of business in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_18_ITEM6_P1_S5	In addition, we recorded net gains on securities and other investments of $343.5 million, which were included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_18_ITEM6_P1_S6	In 2013, we recorded net gains on securities and other investments of $222.8 million, which were included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income (7) The reconciliation of reported diluted earnings per share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is presented below under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.
714603_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	In addition to reporting financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), we have disclosed non-GAAP financial information which has been reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the following financial schedules titled Reconciliation of Reported Diluted Earnings per Share to Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share - Continuing Operations Attributable to DST Systems, Inc.
714603_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	In making these adjustments to determine the non-GAAP results, we take into account the impact of items that are not necessarily ongoing in nature, that do not have a high level of predictability associated with them or that are non-operational in nature.
714603_18_ITEM6_P3_S1	Generally, these items include net gains on dispositions of businesses, net gains (losses) associated with securities and other investments, acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring and impairment costs, and other similar items.
714603_18_ITEM6_P3_S2	Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is also adjusted for the income tax impact of the above items, as applicable.
714603_18_ITEM6_P4_S0	The income tax impact of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred.
714603_18_ITEM6_P4_S1	Additionally, income tax is adjusted to remove the impacts of large discrete or unusual items.
714603_18_ITEM6_P4_S2	Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a useful basis for evaluating underlying business unit performance, but should not be considered in isolation and is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, evaluating business unit performance utilizing GAAP financial information.
714603_18_ITEM6_P4_S3	Management uses non-GAAP measures in its budgeting and forecasting processes and to further analyze our financial trends and operational run-rate, as well as in making financial comparisons to prior periods presented on a similar basis.
714603_18_ITEM6_P4_S4	We believe that providing such adjusted results allows investors and other users of our financial statements to better understand our comparative operating performance for the periods presented.
714603_18_ITEM6_P4_S5	Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure in its own evaluation of the Company s performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods.
714603_18_ITEM6_P4_S6	Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.
714603_18_ITEM6_P4_S7	Although our management believes non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the performance of its business, we acknowledge that items excluded from such measures may have a material impact on our financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP.
714603_18_ITEM6_P4_S8	Therefore, management typically uses non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP results.
714603_18_ITEM6_P4_S9	These factors should be considered when evaluating our results.

714603_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	This report contains forward-looking statements - that is, statements related to future, not past, events.
714603_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, see, will, would, or target.
714603_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.
714603_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	For us, particular risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include:
714603_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	the other factors that are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.
714603_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	These or other uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements.
714603_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	This document includes certain forward-looking projected financial information that is based on current estimates and forecasts.
714603_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact our financial statements or results of operations are difficult to predict.
714603_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	These forward-looking statements are based on information as of the date of this report.
714603_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized, except as may be required by law.
714603_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Introduction DST Systems, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries use proprietary software applications to provide sophisticated information processing and servicing solutions through strategically unified data management and business process solutions to clients globally within the asset management, brokerage, retirement, healthcare and other markets.
714603_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our wholly-owned data centers provide the secure technology infrastructure necessary to support our solutions.
714603_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	In order to position the Company to take advantage of new and emerging technologies, we are embarking on an information technology transformation effort which will increase our operating expenses for the near term.
714603_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	We expect these investments will result in lower centralized infrastructure costs and a more agile platform on which to deliver future capabilities.
714603_18_ITEM7_P7_S4	On January 11, 2018, we entered into a Merger Agreement wherein SS C will acquire DST.
714603_18_ITEM7_P7_S5	Under the terms of the agreement, SS C will purchase DST in an all-cash transaction for $84.00 per share plus the assumption of debt, equating to an enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion.
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	restrictions on making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying dividends, repurchasing stock and taking other specified actions.
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	The transaction is subject to DST stockholder approval, clearances by the relevant regulatory authorities and other customary closing conditions and is currently expected to close by the end of the second quarter 2018; however, there can be no assurances as to the actual closing or the timing of the closing.
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	Consummation of the proposed Merger would constitute a change of control of DST under the partnership agreement of IFDS L.P. and, as a result, the other partner would have the option to purchase our interests in IFDS L.P. at a price equal to book value, unless another purchase provision in the partnership agreement was triggered prior to the change of control.
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	In March 2017, we acquired State Street s ownership interests in our joint ventures BFDS and IFDS U.K., as well as other investments and real estate held by IFDS L.P.
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S4	The BFDS acquisition was effectuated through a non-taxable exchange of our State Street common stock with a fair value of $163.4 million for State Street s ownership interest in BFDS.
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S5	We also acquired State Street s ownership interest in IFDS U.K., and IFDS L.P. s ownership in IFDS Percana and IFDS Realty U.K. for total cash consideration of $234.9 million .
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S6	In May 2017, we completed the sale of our U.K. Customer Communications business for cash consideration of $43.6 million .
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S7	We recorded a pretax gain of $2.6 million on the sale during 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S8	We sold our North American Customer Communications business for cash consideration of $410.7 million on July 1, 2016 and we recorded a pretax gain of $341.5 million on the sale in 2016.
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S9	We have classified the results of the businesses sold as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented.
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S10	The net after-tax proceeds from these sales are being used in accordance with the Company s capital plan, including investments in the business, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, debt repayments and other corporate purposes, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Merger Agreement with SS C. Beginning in 2017, DST established a new reportable segment structure that reflects how management is now operating the business and making resource allocations following the acquisitions of IFDS U.K. and BFDS, as well as the recent reductions in non-core investment assets.
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S11	The Company s operating business units are now reported as three operating segments (Domestic Financial Services, International Financial Services and Healthcare Services).
714603_18_ITEM7_P8_S12	Prior periods have been revised to reflect the new reportable operating segments.
714603_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Domestic Financial Services Segment Through the Domestic Financial Services segment, we provide investor, investment, advisor/intermediary and asset distribution services to companies within the U.S. financial services industry.
714603_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Utilizing our proprietary software applications, we offer our clients information processing solutions that enable them to capture, analyze and report their investors transactions including direct and intermediary sales of mutual funds, alternative investments, securities brokerage accounts and retirement plans.
714603_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Examples of the services we provide include tracking of purchases, redemptions, exchanges and transfers of shares; maintaining investor identification and ownership records; reconciling cash and share activity; processing dividends; reporting sales; and performing tax and other compliance functions.
714603_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	We also support full reporting to investors for confirmations, statements and tax forms, web access, and electronic delivery of documents.
714603_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	Services are provided either on a Remote or BPO basis utilizing our proprietary software applications.
714603_18_ITEM7_P9_S5	Our BPO service offerings are enhanced by our proprietary workflow software, which is also licensed separately to third parties.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Domestic Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts, participants or transactions processed.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	For subaccounts, a portion of the services we provide for registered accounts are provided directly by the broker/dealer.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	As a result, our revenue per account is generally higher for registered accounts than for subaccounts.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	On a more limited basis, we also generate revenue through asset-based fee arrangements and from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in our full service transfer agency bank accounts.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S5	We are continuing to monitor changes in the financial services industry, including the shift from direct products to fee-based platforms which could reduce the number of direct mutual fund registered accounts we service.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S6	In December 2017, we entered into a ten year contract with a new client to provide both mutual fund and retirement servicing solutions.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S7	Based on current volumes, the client is expected to convert approximately 2.0 million registered accounts and 0.3 million retirement accounts onto our platforms during mid to late 2019.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S8	This new client currently performs their processing in-house and in order to assist the new client with covering the costs to transition to our platforms we have agreed to pay them $13.0 million in transition assistance during the conversion, of which $2.0 million was paid in December 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S9	The total amounts will be amortized as a reduction to revenue over the course of the ten year contractual term.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S10	Additionally in December 2017, we renewed our largest Domestic Financial Services client to a new seven year contract.
714603_18_ITEM7_P10_S11	Based upon our new rate structure, we expect our operating revenue in 2018 associated with this client to be relatively consistent with the 2017 revenue.
714603_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	As part of the continuing strategic review of our operations, we decided not to renew a long-term surety bond insurance agreement which expired in December 2017 as the proposed revised terms were no longer economically advantageous.
714603_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	This agreement historically generated approximately $14.0 million of annual revenue.
714603_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	On February 24, 2016, we acquired all of the membership interests of Kaufman Rossin Fund Services LLC ( KRFS ), an independent, full-service provider of specialized hedge fund administration services to the global financial community.
714603_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	KRFS hedge fund services include accounting and valuation, back-office outsourcing, investor services, treasury services, and customized reporting.
714603_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	During 2015, we acquired all of the membership interests of kasina LLC, a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry, and Red Rocks Capital LLC, an asset manager which focuses on listed private equity and other private asset investments.
714603_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	In 2015, we also acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Wealth Management Systems Inc., a provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement marketplace.
714603_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	In December 2015, we entered into a ten year contract with a new client to provide both subaccounting and mutual fund servicing solutions.
714603_18_ITEM7_P11_S7	The client converted approximately 10.0 million subaccounts onto our platform during 2016 and converted approximately 2.6 million registered accounts onto our platform during the third quarter of 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	We offer investor and policyholder administration and technology services on a Remote and BPO basis in the U.K. and, through our joint venture IFDS L.P., in Canada, Ireland, and Luxembourg.
714603_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Additionally, in Australia and in the U.K., we provide solutions related to participant accounting and recordkeeping for wealth management, wrap platforms and retirement savings ( superannuation ) industries/markets through use of our wealth management platform and our life and pension administration system.
714603_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our primary clients are mutual fund managers, insurers and platform providers.
714603_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	International Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts or transactions processed.
714603_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	We also realize revenues from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage increases.
714603_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations.
714603_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients.
714603_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	In November 2016, we sold a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary that provides water billing software and services solutions for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 million .
714603_18_ITEM7_P14_S5	This business had approximately $5.4 million of operating revenue and $1.2 million of operating income on an annual basis.
714603_18_ITEM7_P14_S6	As these decisions were the result of a tactical review of our products and services, and not the result of a significant shift in strategic direction, the revenue and operating income from these products and services are included within our continuing operations.
714603_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	During 2017, we reached a termination agreement with a wealth management platform client who had engaged us for a multi-year development and implementation effort as well as post-implementation services.
714603_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	The termination agreement resulted in incremental operating revenues of $93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue and recognized termination payments received.
714603_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	Additionally, our International Financial Services segment has been notified that two of our clients, which have collectively contributed approximately $33.0 million of annual revenue, will be migrating off our FAST platform in stages through the end of 2018.
714603_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Healthcare Services segment uses our proprietary software applications to provide healthcare organizations a variety of medical and pharmacy benefit solutions to satisfy their information processing, quality of care, cost management concerns and payment integrity programs, while achieving compliance and improving operational efficiencies.
714603_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Our healthcare solutions include claims adjudication, benefit management, care management, business intelligence and other ancillary services.
714603_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	We also continue to expand and enhance our Healthcare Services offerings to ensure we are able to address the changing needs of our clients within the complex and highly regulated health industries which we serve.
714603_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	For example, our pharmacy management business continues to make investments to expand our clinical, network, and analytic capabilities to help our clients and prospective clients achieve the best possible outcomes for their members and to allow us to more effectively compete in the broader competitive pharmacy benefit manager ( PBM ) market.
714603_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Historically, we have acted as an agent within our pharmacy-solutions business and, accordingly, recognized revenue on a net basis.
714603_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	As our enhanced products evolve and we expand our pharmacy-solutions service offerings, we will evaluate the provisions within our new pharmacy network and client contracts to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the transactions.
714603_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	If we determine that we are acting as a principal in the transactions, we will report the transactions on a gross basis, resulting in significantly higher revenues and costs reflected within our consolidated financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	We generally derive revenue from our pharmacy-solutions business on a transactional fee basis.
714603_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	Fees are earned on pharmacy claims processing and payments services, pharmacy and member call center services, pharmaceutical rebate administration, administration or management of clinical programs, pharmacy network management, member and plan web services and management information and reporting.
714603_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Further, revenues include investment earnings related to client cash balances maintained in our bank accounts.
714603_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	Medical claim processing revenues are generally derived from fees charged on a per member/per month basis or transactional basis.
714603_18_ITEM7_P18_S4	We also realize revenue from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage or members increase.
714603_18_ITEM7_P18_S5	Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations.
714603_18_ITEM7_P18_S6	During 2017, we renewed our pharmacy services contract with our Healthcare Services segment s third largest client extending the term of the contract through December 31, 2020.
714603_18_ITEM7_P18_S7	As previously announced, two of our Healthcare Services clients transitioned their services off our systems during 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P18_S8	Additionally, we have been notified that one of our largest Healthcare Services clients, which contributed approximately $50.0 million of annual revenue, will be migrating off our medical claims processing platform in stages through the end of 2019.
714603_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Seasonality Generally, we do not have significant seasonal fluctuations in our business operations.
714603_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Processing volumes for mutual fund clients within our Domestic and International Financial Services segment are usually highest during the quarter ended March 31 due primarily to processing year-end transactions during January.
714603_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	We have historically added operating equipment in the last half of the year in preparation for processing year-end transactions, which has the effect of increasing costs for the second half of the year.
714603_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	Revenues and operating results from individual license sales vary depending on the timing and size of the contracts.
714603_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	New Authoritative Accounting Guidance See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 , Significant Accounting Policies - New authoritative accounting guidance.
714603_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
714603_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
714603_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
714603_18_ITEM7_P20_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
714603_18_ITEM7_P20_S4	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; software capitalization and amortization; depreciation of fixed assets; valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill; accounting for investments; and accounting for income taxes.
714603_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned.
714603_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	The majority of our revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided.
714603_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all client obligations have been met.
714603_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	We generally do not have payment terms from clients that extend beyond one year.
714603_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Billing for services in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.
714603_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.
714603_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	If there is a client-specific acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about client acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of client acceptance.
714603_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the client on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	should be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence, which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	If such evidence is unavailable, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	We derive over 90% of our revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S4	The majority of our fees are billed on a monthly basis, generally with thirty-day collection terms.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S5	Revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon performance of the services.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S6	Our standard business practice is to bill monthly for development, consulting and training services on a time and materials basis.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S7	In some cases we bill a fixed fee for development and consulting services.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S8	For fixed fee arrangements, we recognize revenue on a proportionate performance basis.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S9	We periodically provide upfront cash payments to our clients to assist with the significant upfront costs associated with converting to new systems.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S10	Such payments are treated as a reduction of revenue over the term of the related contract.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S11	We derive less than 10% of our revenues from licensing products.
714603_18_ITEM7_P24_S12	We license our wealth management products, life and pension administration system, AWD products and healthcare administration processing software solutions.
714603_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Perpetual software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Term software license revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement.
714603_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	While license fee revenues are not a significant percentage of our total operations, they can significantly impact earnings in the period in which they are recognized.
714603_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Revenues from individual license sales depend heavily on the timing, size and nature of the contract.
714603_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	We recognize revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectability has been reasonably assured.
714603_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	We may enter into arrangements with broker/dealers or other third parties to sell or market closed-end fund shares.
714603_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	Depending on the arrangement, we may earn distribution fees for marketing and selling the underlying fund shares.
714603_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	Conversely, we may incur distribution expenses, including structuring fees, finders fees and referral fees paid to unaffiliated broker/dealers or introducing parties for marketing and selling underlying fund shares of a closed-end fund we sponsor.
714603_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	While distribution revenues and expenses are not significant percentages of our operating revenues or costs and expenses, they can significantly impact operations and earnings in the period in which they are recognized.
714603_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	We have entered into various agreements with related parties, principally unconsolidated affiliates, under which we have historically provided data processing and software services.
714603_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	We believe that the terms of our contracts with related parties are fair to us and are no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties.
714603_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	We assess collection based on a variety of factors, including past collection history with the client and the credit-worthiness of the client.
714603_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	We generally do not request collateral from our client.
714603_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	If we determine that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.
714603_18_ITEM7_P30_S3	Allowances for billing adjustments and bad debt expense are estimated as revenues are recognized.
714603_18_ITEM7_P30_S4	Allowances for billing adjustments are recorded as reductions in revenues and bad debt expense is recorded within Costs and expenses.
714603_18_ITEM7_P30_S5	The annual amounts for these items are generally immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Software capitalization and amortization We make substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of our processing services as well as our sale of licensed products.
714603_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	We develop a large portion of our software internally.
714603_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	We capitalize software development costs for computer software developed or obtained for internal use after the preliminary project phase has been completed and management has committed to funding the project.
714603_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	For computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed to third parties, we capitalize software development costs which are incurred after the products reach technological feasibility but prior to the general release of the product to clients.
714603_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_18_ITEM7_P33_S4	Significant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects.
714603_18_ITEM7_P33_S5	Management specifically evaluates software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts, milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects.
714603_18_ITEM7_P33_S6	Significant changes in any of these items may result in discontinuing capitalization of development costs, as well as immediately expensing previously capitalized costs.
714603_18_ITEM7_P33_S7	We review, on a quarterly basis, our capitalized software for possible impairment.
714603_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Depreciation of fixed assets For personal property, we generally prefer to own rather than lease the property when practicable.
714603_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	We believe this approach provides us with better flexibility for disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life.
714603_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	We depreciate technology equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives: (1) non-mainframe equipment three years; (2) mainframe central processing unit four years; and (3) mainframe direct access storage devices five years.
714603_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	We depreciate furniture and fixtures over estimated useful lives, principally three to five years, using accelerated depreciation methods.
714603_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	We depreciate leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements.
714603_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Management judgment is required in assigning economic lives to fixed assets.
714603_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	Management specifically analyzes fixed asset additions, remaining net book values and gain/loss upon disposition of fixed assets to determine the appropriateness of assigned economic lives.
714603_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	Significant changes in any of these items may result in changes in the economic life assigned and the resulting depreciation expense.
714603_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment.
714603_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	We evaluate the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and evaluate identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
714603_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	Factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy for the overall business; and significant negative industry or economic trends.
714603_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	When it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we assess actual impairment based on cash flows.
714603_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our assessment of goodwill for impairment may first include a qualitative assessment that considers various factors, including those described above as well as growth in operating revenues and income from operations of our reporting units since our last quantitative assessment.
714603_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.
714603_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	Our quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment includes comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value, including goodwill.
714603_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	We estimate fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches.
714603_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
714603_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
714603_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis.
714603_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	Our 2017 , 2016 and 2015 annual goodwill impairment tests determined that goodwill was not impaired, except during 2016 for the goodwill held at the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit, which is included as a component of discontinued operations, as further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data - Note 4, Discontinued Operations.
714603_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Accounting for investments We have four significant types of investments: 1) investments in available-for-sale securities; 2) investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are comprised principally of IFDS L.P. and certain real estate joint ventures; 3) investments in private equity funds and other investments accounted for under the cost method; and 4) seed capital investments accounted for at fair value.
714603_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	We account for investments in entities in which we own less than 20% and do not have significant influence in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, which requires us to designate our investments as trading or available-for-sale.
714603_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders equity.
714603_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	We regularly review investment securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds fair value, the duration of any market decline, and the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer.
714603_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	We record an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary.
714603_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our financial position.
714603_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	The equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities, partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where we are the limited partner) in which we have significant influence but do not control.
714603_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Under the equity method, we recognize income or losses from our pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of our investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	The cost method of accounting is used for these investments when we have a de minimis ownership percentage and do not have significant influence.
714603_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	Our cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.
714603_18_ITEM7_P43_S4	Accounting for income taxes We account for income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns.
714603_18_ITEM7_P43_S5	Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).
714603_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), resulting in significant modifications to existing U.S. tax law, including but not limited to, (1) lowering the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018; (2) eliminating the domestic production activity deduction; (3) implementing a territorial tax system; and (4) imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
714603_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118 ) which provides additional clarification in situations where we do not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act for the reporting period in which the Tax Act was enacted.
714603_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	We have recognized the provisional tax impacts, based on reasonable estimates, related to the one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through the year ended December 31, 2017 ( Transition Tax ) and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and has included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.
714603_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	We intend to complete our accounting under the Tax Act within the measurement period set forth in SAB 118.
714603_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.
714603_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.
714603_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	We recognize liabilities for potential tax exposures based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be required.
714603_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, then we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary.
714603_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained if challenged by the taxing authorities.
714603_18_ITEM7_P47_S4	To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected.
714603_18_ITEM7_P47_S5	An unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_18_ITEM7_P47_S6	A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
714603_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions within income tax expense.
714603_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Results of Operations The following table summarizes our consolidated operating results (in millions).
714603_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	Additional information regarding our segments is included below under the caption, Year to Year Business Segment Comparisons.

714603_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Consolidated operating revenues increased $612.3 million or 41.5% in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. in 2017 which collectively contributed $601.8 million of incremental operating revenue during 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	Consolidated operating revenues increased $69.4 million or 4.9% in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the acquisitions of KRFS in February 2016, Red Rocks Capital LLC in July 2015 and Wealth Management Systems Inc. in August 2015.

714603_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	The increase in costs and expenses in 2017, exclusive of reimbursable expenses, is primarily attributable to the consolidation of BFDS and IFDS U.K. following the acquisitions of the remaining interests in these entities during 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P54_S4	Share-based compensation expense increased $31.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the prior year reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense as 2015 PSUs were not expected to achieve the required performance criteria combined with increased share-based compensation expense in 2017 related to 2016 and 2017 PSUs that are currently expected to vest at a higher conversion rate than target.
714603_18_ITEM7_P54_S5	In addition, we recorded increased bad debt expense and a significant charitable contribution transaction in 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	As a result of changes in our business environment, including the transition of certain Health Services clients off of our systems, the termination of a wealth management client in the International Financial Services segment, and the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K., we have implemented restructuring initiatives to right-size our organization and enhance operational efficiencies, as well as achieve synergies from our recent acquisitions.

714603_18_ITEM7_P56_S4	Interest expense increased 14.0% during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to higher borrowings as a result of the acquisition of IFDS U.K. and higher borrowing rates on the $350.0 million of debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P56_S5	Interest expense decreased 1.3% during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily from lower weighted average debt balances outstanding.
714603_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Gain on sale of business On November 1, 2016, we sold DST Billing Solutions Limited ( Billing Solutions ) for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 million.

714603_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	We recognized a realized gain of $145.1 million from the exchange of State Street common stock for the remaining interests in BFDS in 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	We also recognized a realized gain of $10.4 million from the charitable contribution of our remaining State Street shares in 2017.

714603_18_ITEM7_P59_S4	We recorded a net gain on private equity funds and other investments of $15.4 million , $16.5 million and $35.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, primarily due to distributions received from certain of our private equity fund investments resulting in realized gains.
714603_18_ITEM7_P59_S5	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments and may require an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our net income.
714603_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	We receive dividend income from certain investments held.
714603_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	The decline in dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by our reduction of our investment in State Street common stock in March 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	Dividends received from State Street common stock were $0.1 million , $3.1 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

714603_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Equity in earnings of IFDS U.K. decreased $9.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 , as compared to 2016 , primarily as a result of the discontinuation of equity method accounting subsequent to our acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. Equity in earnings of IFDS U.K. decreased $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 , as compared to 2015 , primarily attributable to lower revenues recognized related to client conversion activities and higher operating costs as IFDS U.K. expanded its infrastructure to address increasing regulatory, compliance and security needs.
714603_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	Equity in earnings of IFDS L.P. increased $16.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 , as compared to 2016 , primarily as a result of $10.2 million of realized gains on the step-up of certain investments and real estate assets that were distributed from the joint venture to DST and State Street immediately prior to the acquisitions by DST of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. and BFDS.
714603_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	Equity in earnings of IFDS L.P. decreased $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 , as compared to 2015 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	Equity in earnings of BFDS decreased $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P61_S4	The decrease was primarily as a result of the discontinuation of equity method accounting subsequent to the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS in March 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	The increase was primarily attributable to higher ancillary and non-operating revenues as well as a reduction in operating costs.
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	Our equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $31.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 , an increase of $24.9 million as compared to 2016 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	The increase was primarily due to a $23.0 million increase resulting from a gain on the step-up of real estate distributed from Broadway Square Partners, LLP ( Broadway Square Partners ), an unconsolidated affiliate, during 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S4	Our equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of $3.5 million as compared to 2015 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S5	The decrease was primarily due to a $3.6 million gain resulting from the sale of real estate by an unconsolidated affiliate during 2015.
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S6	As of December 31, 2017, approximately $40.8 million of our consolidated retained earnings represents undistributed earnings in our unconsolidated affiliates accounted for by the equity method of accounting.

714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S8	Our income tax rate for 2017 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the non-taxable nature of the BFDS exchange transaction, the impacts of the Tax Act, the adoption of new accounting guidance issued for tax benefits on employee share-based compensation transactions, benefits realized from the settlement of uncertain tax positions, and a change in the proportional mix of domestic and international transactions.
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S9	The 2017 impact of the Tax Act was a $13.7 million tax benefit, primarily from the net impact of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities utilizing the enacted tax rate at the time they are anticipated to be realized less the estimated tax associated with the deemed mandatory repatriation of undistributed accumulated foreign earnings.
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S10	This reflects our current estimate of the U.S. income tax effects of the Tax Act, however these are provisional amounts subject to adjustment during the one year measurement period provided pursuant to guidance in SAB 118.
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S11	Our effective income tax rate for 2016 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily attributable to state income taxes, transaction related taxes, and a change in the proportional mix of domestic and international income, partially offset by federal income tax credits for foreign income taxes and research and development costs.
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S12	Our effective income tax rate for 2015 was favorably impacted by an $11.9 million benefit from the completion of the IRS examination of previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions, research and experimentation credits and capital losses for 2010 as well as other remeasurements during the period.
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S13	Excluding the effect of discrete period items, we currently expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26.5% in 2018 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S14	The 2018 tax rate can be affected as a result of variances among the estimates and amounts of 2018 sources of taxable income (e.g., domestic consolidated, joint venture and/or international), the realization of tax credits, adjustments which may arise from the resolution of tax matters under review, our assessment of our liability for uncertain tax positions, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, federal tax regulations and guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S15	Income from discontinued operations, net of tax Income from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased $243.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $199.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S16	The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the sale of our North American Customer Communications business in July 2016, partially offset by the sale of our U.K. Customer Communications business in May 2017.
714603_18_ITEM7_P62_S17	The increase during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to the $234.7 million gain, net of tax, on the sale of our North American Customer Communications business partially offset by $17.0 million of goodwill and asset impairments in our U.K. Customer Communications business.
714603_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	The following table presents the financial results of the Domestic Financial Services segment (in millions):
714603_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	The following table summarizes the Domestic Financial Services segment s statistical metrics (in millions, except as noted):
714603_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Domestic Financial Services segment operating revenues of $1,187.2 million reflect an increase of $191.4 million or 19.2% in 2017 as compared to 2016 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the remaining interest in BFDS, which contributed $176.6 million of incremental operating revenues.
714603_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	Excluding the BFDS operating revenues in 2017, operating revenues for the Domestic Financial Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $14.8 million or 1.5% .
714603_18_ITEM7_P65_S3	This increase in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 was partially due to a $5.0 million increase in revenue at ALPS resulting from an insurance claim reimbursement of $2.0 million received in fourth quarter 2017 as compared to a reduction to ALPS revenue of $3.0 million during 2016 for the processing error that generated the insurance claim.
714603_18_ITEM7_P65_S4	In addition, operating revenues were higher as a result of increased fund flows and higher market performance at ALPS, partially offset by decreased revenues resulting from the exit of certain product offerings and lower subaccounting and mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenues.
714603_18_ITEM7_P65_S5	Additionally, software license revenues were $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , a decrease of $3.9 million as compared to 2016 .

714603_18_ITEM7_P65_S9	This increase was primarily attributable to $176.3 million of incremental costs and expenses from the consolidation of BFDS following the acquisition of the remaining interest in that entity in 2017 and higher share-based compensation expense which increased $25.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	In addition, costs and expenses increased from higher integration and restructuring costs related to our BFDS acquisition and higher information technology transformation spend partially offset by the non-recurrence of a software impairment recorded in 2016.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	We recorded restructuring charges of $16.3 million and $10.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we also recognized $11.6 million of expense related to a charitable contribution of our remaining State Street stock.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	Depreciation and amortization Domestic Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $86.8 million , an increase of $9.5 million or 12.3% as compared to 2016 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S4	The increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization associated with acquired intangibles from the recent acquisitions as well as increased depreciation from capitalized costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure, security and regulatory compliance.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S5	Operating income Domestic Financial Services segment operating income for 2017 was $140.0 million , a decrease of $22.5 million or 13.8% as compared to 2016 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S6	The decrease in Domestic Financial Services operating income was primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense, higher advisory and restructuring costs due to the integration activities for the recently acquired BFDS business and increased depreciation and amortization expense.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S7	Operating income also decreased due to an increase in information technology transformation spend, partially offset by higher revenues.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S8	Domestic Financial Services segment operating revenues of $995.8 million increased $12.7 million or 1.3% in 2016 as compared to 2015 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S9	The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven from businesses acquired during 2015 and 2016, which contributed $31.8 million of incremental operating revenues.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S10	During 2016, we also completed the conversion of approximately 10.0 million subaccounts associated with a previously announced new client, which resulted in incremental revenues.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S11	These increases were partly offset by a decline in mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenue due to lower registered accounts, primarily as a result of subaccounting conversions, and lower revenue due to extending certain long-term contracts with lower pricing.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S12	Additionally, software license revenues were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of $0.9 million as compared to 2015 .

714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S15	Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, Domestic Financial Services costs and expenses increased $24.4 million or 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S16	On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2016 was primarily from acquisitions completed during 2015 and 2016, which included approximately $33.7 million of incremental expenses.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S17	Also, contributing to the increase in costs and expenses were the restructuring activities, which resulted in $10.4 million of employee and lease termination costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 to enhance operational efficiency within the Domestic Financial Services segment.

714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S19	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we also recognized a $6.0 million software impairment.
714603_18_ITEM7_P66_S20	These costs and expenses were partially offset by the reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense as 2015 PSUs were not expected to achieve the required performance criteria required for vesting and further savings realized from cost containment initiatives.

714603_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	The increase in 2016 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization associated with acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016 as well as increased depreciation from capitalized costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure and increase security and regulatory compliance.
714603_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	The increase in 2016 was also attributable to the acceleration of depreciation on certain capitalized software during 2016.

714603_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	These decreases were partially offset by the reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense, higher operating revenues and cost containment efforts during 2016.

714603_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by the acquisition of the remaining interest in IFDS U.K., which contributed $425.2 million of incremental operating revenues, including the financial impacts resulting from the termination of a wealth management client agreement.
714603_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	The termination agreement resulted in incremental operating revenues of $93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as DST accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue and recognized termination payments received.

714603_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	The decrease in operating revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the previously announced client transitions off of our systems, which resulted in approximately $46.5 million of lower revenues.

714603_18_ITEM7_P77_S3	On this basis, the increase in operating revenues primarily resulted from organic growth and the expansion of the high-value services that we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses.
714603_18_ITEM7_P77_S4	These increases were partially offset by reductions in membership related to exchanges and lower consulting and development revenues which we believe is the result of a decline in healthcare technology spending due to the ongoing uncertainty around government policy changes.

714603_18_ITEM7_P78_S10	These costs and expenses were partially offset by restructuring costs that occurred during 2015 that did not recur during 2016 and a $2.4 million reduction of share-based compensation expense as certain PSUs were no longer expected to vest.

714603_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client obligations are primarily sourced by funds held on behalf of clients.
714603_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	We had $504.2 million , $564.6 million and $ 533.4 million of client funds obligations at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	Debt Activity During 2017 , we had the following primary sources of debt financing: our syndicated revolving credit facility; accounts receivable securitization program; and privately placed senior notes (the 2010 Senior Notes and 2017 Senior Notes ).
714603_18_ITEM7_P89_S3	We had $620.8 million , $508.2 million and $562.1 million of debt outstanding at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, an increase of $112.6 million during 2017 and a decrease of $53.9 million during 2016 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P89_S4	The increase in debt outstanding during 2017 resulted primarily from issuing $350.0 million of 2017 Senior Notes in November 2017, the assumption of a mortgage as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. and the assumption of a mortgage associated with a real estate distribution from Broadway Square Partners, partially offset by a reduction in amounts outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facilities.
714603_18_ITEM7_P89_S5	Proceeds from the 2017 Senior Notes were primarily used to pay down our revolving credit facilities.
714603_18_ITEM7_P89_S6	The decrease in debt outstanding during 2016 resulted primarily from the utilization of the proceeds from the sale of our North American Customer Communications business to pay down outstanding balances, partially offset by borrowings to fund the KRFS business acquisition, share repurchases and working capital uses.
714603_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary indebtedness, asset dispositions and require certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	We are currently in compliance with these covenants.
714603_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	A default under certain of our borrowings could trigger defaults under certain of our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in their maturities being accelerated.
714603_18_ITEM7_P90_S3	Our debt arrangements are further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 , Debt.
714603_18_ITEM7_P90_S4	The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions):
714603_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Interest obligations on our outstanding debt are not included in the table above.
714603_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	The syndicated revolving credit facility contains grid schedules that adjust borrowing costs up or down based upon our consolidated leverage ratio.
714603_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	The grid schedules may result in fluctuations in borrowing costs ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% over Eurodollar and 0.00% to 0.70% over base rate , as defined.
714603_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The 2010 Senior Notes outstanding have fixed interest rates and are comprised of $65.0 million of 5.06% Series C Senior Notes and $160.0 million of 5.42% Series D Senior Notes.
714603_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	The $350.0 million of 2017 Senior Notes outstanding have an average fixed interest rate of approximately 4.0%.
714603_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	In addition to the financial instruments listed above, the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization program are determined based on variable interest rates associated with LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
714603_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	We have liabilities for income tax uncertainties of $67.7 million at December 31, 2017 .
714603_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	These obligations are classified as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as resolution of these matters is expected to take more than a year; however, the ultimate timing of resolution is uncertain.
714603_18_ITEM7_P95_S2	As we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits, our liability for income tax uncertainties is not included in the table above.
714603_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Due to the enactment of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional income tax payable related to the Transition Tax of $8.4 million, of which $7.3 million is reported as noncurrent as it is not expected to be paid within one year.
714603_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	As permitted by the Tax Act, the Transition Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, beginning in 2018, and will not accrue interest.
714603_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	provisional amount, as well as the current estimated timing of payments, is subject to change based on additional guidance from and interpretations by U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies and changes in assumptions.
714603_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Other Commercial Commitments In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products and other business assets, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters.
714603_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties.
714603_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.
714603_18_ITEM7_P98_S3	At December 31, 2017 , except for certain immaterial items, there were no liabilities for guarantees or indemnifications as it is not possible to determine either the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements or the timing of any such payments due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
714603_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	Historically, payments made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
714603_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	Under certain circumstances, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $165.0 million to SS C in the event the Merger Agreement with SS C is terminated.
714603_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.
714603_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	We believe that our guarantee arrangements will not have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures, capital resources, liquidity or results of operations.
714603_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	These arrangements are described above and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 , Commitments and Contingencies.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest rate risk We derive service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which we are the agent for clients.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The balances maintained in the bank accounts will fluctuate.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2017 , DST had average daily cash balances of approximately $2.0 billion maintained in such accounts.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We estimate that a 100 basis point change in the short-term interest earnings rate would equal approximately $8.6 million of net income (loss).
714603_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	At December 31, 2017 , we had $620.8 million of debt, of which $14.9 million was subject to variable interest rates (LIBOR rates).
714603_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We estimate that a 10% increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact to our consolidated pretax earnings or to the fair value of our debt.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The effect of changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt is mitigated by changes in interest rates attributable to balance earnings.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign currency exchange rate risk The operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in our exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The principal currencies involved are the British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Thai baht and Indian rupee.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our international subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	We translate our assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and translate income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Currency exchange rate fluctuations have not historically significantly affected our consolidated financial results.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2017 , our international subsidiaries for our continuing operations had approximately $758.1 million in total assets and for the year ended December 31, 2017 , these international subsidiaries recorded net income of approximately $70.4 million .
714603_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We estimate that a 10% change in exchange rates would have changed total consolidated assets by approximately $75.8 million .
714603_18_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Furthermore, a 10% change in exchange rates based upon historical earnings in international operations would have changed consolidated net income for 2017 by approximately $7.0 million .
714603_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We have entered into foreign currency cash flow and economic hedging programs to mitigate the impact of movements in foreign currency (principally British pound, Australian dollar, Thai baht and Indian rupee) on our operations.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The total notional value of our foreign currency derivatives was $101.1 million at December 31, 2017 .
714603_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in an asset of $0.2 million at December 31, 2017 .
714603_18_ITEM7A_P6_S3	We estimate that a 10% change in exchange rates would result in a $0.9 million change in other comprehensive income.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $0.3 million at December 31, 2017 .
714603_18_ITEM7A_P6_S5	We estimate a 10% change in exchange rates on these contracts would result in a $4.8 million change to consolidated net income.
714603_18_ITEM7A_P6_S6	Gains and losses on the derivative instruments are largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in a minimal impact on earnings.
714603_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of DST Systems, Inc.:
714603_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of DST Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
714603_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
714603_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
714603_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
714603_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
714603_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
714603_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	( PCAOB ) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
714603_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
714603_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
714603_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
714603_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P5_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
714603_18_ITEM8_P5_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
714603_18_ITEM8_P5_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
714603_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	As described in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. ( BFDS ) and International Financial Data Services Limited ( IFDS UK ) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 because the entities were acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	We have also excluded BFDS and IFDS UK from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.
714603_18_ITEM8_P6_S2	BFDS is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 15% and 13%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P6_S3	IFDS UK is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 25% and 22%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
714603_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
714603_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 1969.
714603_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	Description of Business DST Systems, Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries ( we, our, us, the Company or DST ) use proprietary software applications to provide sophisticated information processing and servicing solutions, through strategically unified business processing and data management, to clients globally within the asset management, brokerage, retirement, healthcare and other markets.
714603_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	Our wholly-owned data centers provide the secure technology infrastructure necessary to support our solutions.
714603_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	wherein SS C Technologies Holdings, Inc. ( SS C ) will acquire DST (the Merger ).
714603_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, SS C will purchase DST in an all-cash transaction for $84.00 per share plus the assumption of debt, equating to an enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion .
714603_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company has agreed to customary covenants in the Merger Agreement, including with respect to the Company s operation of its business prior to the closing of the transaction or termination of the agreement, such as restrictions on making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying dividends, repurchasing stock and taking other specified actions.
714603_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	The transaction is subject to DST stockholder approval, clearances by the relevant regulatory authorities and other customary closing conditions and is currently expected to close by the end of the second quarter 2018; however, there can be no assurances as to the actual closing or the timing of the closing.
714603_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Under certain circumstances, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $165.0 million to SS C in the event the Merger Agreement with SS C is terminated.
714603_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	In March 2017, we acquired State Street Corporation s ( State Street ) ownership interest in our joint ventures Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. ( BFDS ) and International Financial Data Services U.K. Limited ( IFDS U.K. ), as well as other investments and real estate held by International Financial Data Services, L.P. ( IFDS L.P. ).
714603_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	BFDS and IFDS U.K. were consolidated in our financial results from the date control of these entities was obtained.
714603_18_ITEM8_P19_S2	See Note 3, Significant Business Transactions, for additional information.
714603_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	Beginning in 2017, DST established a new reportable segment structure that separates the previously reported Financial Services segment into two new segments, Domestic Financial Services and International Financial Services, based upon the geographical location of the revenue-generating business.
714603_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	The activity within the previously reported Investments and Other segment has now been included in either the Domestic or International Financial Services segments based on the business supported.
714603_18_ITEM8_P20_S2	The Healthcare Services segment remains unchanged.
714603_18_ITEM8_P20_S3	The new segment presentation is reflective of how management is now operating the business and making resource allocations following the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K., as well as the recent reductions in non-core investment assets.
714603_18_ITEM8_P20_S4	The Company s operating business units are now reported as three operating segments (Domestic Financial Services, International Financial Services and Healthcare Services).
714603_18_ITEM8_P20_S5	Prior periods have been revised to reflect the new reportable operating segments.
714603_18_ITEM8_P20_S6	In May 2017, our Board of Directors declared a two -for-one stock split of DST s outstanding common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend, which was paid on June 8, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 26, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P20_S7	In connection with the stock split, 16.5 million treasury shares were used to settle a portion of the distribution.
714603_18_ITEM8_P20_S8	All share and per share data, excluding treasury shares, have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to reflect the stock split, as if the stock split had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
714603_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	We sold our North American Customer Communications business on July 1, 2016 and sold our United Kingdom ( U.K. ) Customer Communications business on May 4, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	We have classified the results of the Customer Communications businesses sold as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
714603_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	See Note 4 , Discontinued Operations , for additional information.
714603_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	The consolidated financial statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company.
714603_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
714603_18_ITEM8_P22_S2	Certain amounts in the 2016 and 2015 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation.
714603_18_ITEM8_P22_S3	The adjustments to prior years relate to the 2017 stock split and segment realignment.
714603_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	We consolidate any entity in which we have a controlling financial interest.
714603_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Under the voting interest model, generally the investor that has voting control (usually more than 50% of an entity s voting interests) consolidates the entity.
714603_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	and the ability to participate in the entity s economics consolidates the entity.
714603_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	An entity is considered a VIE if it possesses one of the following characteristics: 1) the entity is thinly capitalized; 2) residual equity holders do not control the entity; 3) equity holders are shielded from economic losses; 4) equity holders do not participate fully in an entity s residual economics; and 5) the entity was established with non-substantive voting interests.
714603_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	For consolidated subsidiaries that are less than wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as non-controlling interests.
714603_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	Non-controlling interests that are redeemable or convertible for cash or other assets at the option of the holder are classified separate from stockholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	The portion of net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest for such subsidiaries is presented as net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	We had the following significant operating joint ventures prior to March 2017: BFDS; IFDS U.K.; and IFDS L.P.
714603_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	We did not have a controlling financial interest in these entities and therefore accounted for the financial results of these operating joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.
714603_18_ITEM8_P27_S2	In March 2017, we acquired State Street s ownership in both BFDS and IFDS U.K., which resulted in control of the entities.
714603_18_ITEM8_P27_S3	As such, they were consolidated in our financial results from the date control was obtained.
714603_18_ITEM8_P27_S4	We continue to account for IFDS L.P. as an equity method investment.
714603_18_ITEM8_P27_S5	We are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering a large portion of our Kansas City, Missouri-based leased office facilities.
714603_18_ITEM8_P27_S6	The lessors are generally joint ventures (in which we have a 50% ownership) that have been established specifically to purchase, finance and engage in leasing activities with the joint venture partners and unrelated third parties.
714603_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Our analysis of our real estate joint ventures for all periods presented indicate that none qualified as a VIE and, accordingly, they have not been consolidated.
714603_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	We provide investment management services to, and have transactions with, various exchange traded funds, mutual funds and other investment products sponsored by the Company in the normal course of business.
714603_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	We generally are considered to have a controlling financial interest in a fund when we own a majority of the outstanding controlling shares, which may arise as a result of seed capital investments in newly launched investment products from the time of initial launch to the time that the fund becomes majority-held by third-party investors.
714603_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
714603_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
714603_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned.
714603_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	The majority of our revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided.
714603_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all client obligations have been met.
714603_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	We periodically provide upfront cash payments to our clients to assist with the significant upfront costs associated with converting to new systems.
714603_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	Such payments are initially recorded within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and treated as a reduction of revenue over the term of the related contract.
714603_18_ITEM8_P32_S2	We generally do not have payment terms from clients that extend beyond one year.
714603_18_ITEM8_P32_S3	Revenue from operating leases is recognized monthly as the rent accrues.
714603_18_ITEM8_P32_S4	Billing for services in which cash is collected in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.
714603_18_ITEM8_P32_S5	Allowances for billing adjustments and bad debt expense are estimated as revenues are recognized.
714603_18_ITEM8_P32_S6	Allowances for billing adjustments are recorded as reductions in revenues and bad debt expense is recorded within Costs and expenses.
714603_18_ITEM8_P32_S7	The annual amounts for these items are generally immaterial to our consolidated financial st a tements, however in 2017 we had $37.5 million of bad debt expense, which is reflected in Costs and expenses, primarily as a result of a client termination agreement.
714603_18_ITEM8_P32_S8	We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.
714603_18_ITEM8_P32_S9	If there is a client-specific acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about client acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of client acceptance.
714603_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting.
714603_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	probable and substantially in our control.
714603_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
714603_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence, which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items.
714603_18_ITEM8_P35_S2	If such evidence is unavailable, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.
714603_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist.
714603_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	Deferral of software license revenue results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services.
714603_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	We recognize revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectability has been reasonably assured.
714603_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket ( OOP ) expenses, such as postage and telecommunications charges, are recorded as revenue on an accrual basis.
714603_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	Because these additional revenues are offset by the reimbursable expenses incurred, there is minimal impact on income from operations and net income.
714603_18_ITEM8_P37_S2	For each segment, total revenues are reported in two categories, operating revenues and OOP reimbursements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P37_S3	OOP expenses are included in costs and expenses.
714603_18_ITEM8_P37_S4	Costs and expenses Costs and expenses include all costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, incurred to produce revenues.
714603_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	We believe that the nature of our business as well as our organizational structure, in which virtually all officers and associates have operational responsibilities, does not allow for a meaningful segregation of selling, general and administrative costs.
714603_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	These costs, which we believe to be immaterial, are also included in costs and expenses.
714603_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Substantially all depreciation and amortization is directly associated with the production of revenues.
714603_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Cash equivalents Short-term liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents.
714603_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	Due to the short-term nature of these investments, carrying value approximates market value.
714603_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	Client funds/obligations Funds held on behalf of clients In connection with providing data processing services for our clients, we may hold client funds on behalf of transfer agency clients and pharmacy processing clients.
714603_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	End-of-day available client bank balances for full service mutual fund transfer agency clients are invested overnight.

714603_18_ITEM8_P42_S5	Client funds obligations Client funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us.
714603_18_ITEM8_P42_S6	In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency client balances invested overnight.
714603_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	We have reported the cash flows related to the purchases of investment funds (available-for-sale securities) held on behalf of clients and the cash flows related to the proceeds from the sales/maturities of investment funds held on behalf of clients on a gross basis in the investing section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

714603_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Investments The equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities, partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where we are the limited partner) in which we have significant influence but do not control.
714603_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	Under the equity method, we recognize income or losses from our pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of our investment in and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_18_ITEM8_P44_S3	The cost method of accounting is used for these investments when we have a de minimis ownership percentage and do not have significant influence.
714603_18_ITEM8_P44_S4	Our cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.
714603_18_ITEM8_P44_S5	These investments do not have readily determinable fair values and the fair value of a cost-method investment is not required to be estimated unless there are identifiable events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.
714603_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Investments classified as available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income.
714603_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	Investments in trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.
714603_18_ITEM8_P45_S2	Investments classified as held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
714603_18_ITEM8_P45_S3	Fair value adjustments and realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis.
714603_18_ITEM8_P45_S4	We regularly review investment securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds fair value, the duration of any market decline, and the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer.
714603_18_ITEM8_P45_S5	We record an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary.
714603_18_ITEM8_P45_S6	Investment funds which are consolidated as a result of our seed capital investment are considered investment companies and therefore we retain the specialized industry accounting principles of these investment products in our consolidated financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	Upon consolidation of a fund, the underlying securities of the fund are reflected at fair value with gains and losses included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	Security transactions and investment income Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date.
714603_18_ITEM8_P46_S2	Security gains and losses are calculated on the specific identification method.

714603_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	Software is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, generally three to five years.
714603_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	We review, on a quarterly basis, our property and equipment for possible impairment.
714603_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.
714603_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	We capitalize costs for the development of internal use software, including coding and software configuration costs and costs of upgrades and enhancements, after the preliminary project phase has been completed and management has committed to funding the project.
714603_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis, depending on the nature of the project, generally over a three to five year period.
714603_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	We review, on a quarterly basis, our capitalized software for possible impairment.
714603_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	Development costs for software that will be sold or licensed to third parties, prior to the achievement of technological feasibility, are expensed as incurred.
714603_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	We capitalize software development costs for software that will be sold or licensed to third parties which are incurred after the products reach technological feasibility but prior to the general release of the product to clients.
714603_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	These capitalized development costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis using the greater of the amount computed by taking the ratio of current year s gross revenues to current and anticipated future gross revenues or the amount computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the product, which is generally three to five years.
714603_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	We evaluate the net realizable value of capitalized software development costs on a product-by-product basis.
714603_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets We have recorded goodwill and intangible assets in connection with various acquisitions of businesses.
714603_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	Intangible assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016 primarily represent client relationships and other definite lived intangible assets (trade names, non-compete agreements, etc.) acquired.
714603_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	The estimated useful life on these intangible assets ranges from 3 to 19 years.
714603_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	The weighted average amortization period at December 31, 2017 for client relationships and other intangible assets is 13.0 and 8.7 years, respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	We assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and assess identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
714603_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	Intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.
714603_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	Our assessments of goodwill for impairment for 2017 and 2016 included a quantitative assessment that compared the fair value to the net book value of our reporting units.
714603_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows.
714603_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	For 2015, we performed a qualitative assessment that considered various factors, including growth in operating revenues and income from operations of our reporting units since our last quantitative assessment in 2014.
714603_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	Our 2017 , 2016 and 2015 annual goodwill impairment tests determined that goodwill was not impaired, except during 2016 for the goodwill held at the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit, which was included as a component of discontinued operations as of December 31, 2016, as further described in Note 4 , Discontinued Operations .
714603_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	Income taxes We recognize the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.
714603_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	Deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the liability method.
714603_18_ITEM8_P61_S2	This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and differences between the income tax and financial accounting statement bases of assets and liabilities and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment.
714603_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	The income statement effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes on the balance sheet.
714603_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	From time to time, we enter into transactions for which the tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code or applicable state tax laws is uncertain.
714603_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	We provide federal and/or state income taxes on such transactions, together with related interest, net of income tax benefit, and any applicable penalties in accordance with accounting guidance for income tax uncertainties.
714603_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	We record income tax uncertainties that are estimated to take more than 12 months to resolve as non-current.
714603_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are recorded in income tax expense.
714603_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	Foreign currency translation Our international subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency.
714603_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	We translate our assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates.
714603_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	Income and expense accounts are translated at average rates during the period.
714603_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	Diluted earnings per share are determined by including the dilutive effect of all potential common shares outstanding during the year.
714603_18_ITEM8_P66_S2	See Note 13 , Equity , for additional details regarding our earnings per share computation.
714603_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	Derivative and hedging activities We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value and the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
714603_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	From time to time, we utilize derivatives to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
714603_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	We do not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes.
714603_18_ITEM8_P68_S2	At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had derivative instruments outstanding as described in Note 11 , Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments .
714603_18_ITEM8_P68_S3	We include cash flows related to derivative instruments qualifying for hedge accounting and economic hedges in the same category as the item being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	Comprehensive income Our comprehensive income consists of net income and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, our proportional share of unconsolidated affiliates other comprehensive income (limited by the carrying value of the investment), unrealized gains or losses on our cash flow hedges, changes in defined benefit pension items and foreign currency translation adjustments, which are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, net of tax and reclassifications to earnings.
714603_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	Share-based compensation We have share-based compensation plans covering our employees and our non-employee directors and have outstanding share awards (primarily in the form of stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units) under each of these plans.
714603_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	We recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.
714603_18_ITEM8_P70_S2	For share-based awards that contain a service feature, we expense the grant date fair value of these awards using the straight-line method over the service period.
714603_18_ITEM8_P70_S3	For share-based awards containing both service and performance features, amortization of expense depends on our judgments whether the performance conditions will be achieved and is incurred over the expected period to achieve the required performance criteria.
714603_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	We account for forfeitures as they occur rather than using an estimated forfeiture rate.
714603_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	Contingencies Loss contingencies from legal proceedings and claims may occur from government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, contractual claims, tax and other matters.
714603_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	Accruals are recognized when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
714603_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	Gain contingencies (including contingent proceeds related to business divestitures) are not recognized until realized.
714603_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	Legal fees are expensed as incurred.
714603_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance which simplifies goodwill impairment testing including eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in determining the existence and value of a goodwill impairment.
714603_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	The guidance was adopted by us on January 1, 2017 and effective for our annual goodwill impairment assessment for 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows.
714603_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	The guidance was adopted by us on January 1, 2017 and resulted in approximately $3.0 million of excess tax benefits being recognized in Income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P74_S2	We also elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than using an estimated forfeiture rate.
714603_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	The impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material.
714603_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies the hedge accounting model and includes new permitted methodologies for measuring changes in the fair value of hedged risks and new presentation and disclosure requirements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P75_S2	The guidance is effective January 1, 2019 and requires a modified retrospective application for existing hedges on the date of adoption.
714603_18_ITEM8_P75_S3	We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements, however we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	In November 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires the statement of cash flows to explain changes during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
714603_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 and requires retrospective application.
714603_18_ITEM8_P76_S2	Beginning January 1, 2018, we will include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents associated with funds held on behalf of clients, as a component of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
714603_18_ITEM8_P76_S3	The impact on our consolidated financial statements will be limited to cash flows from investing activities.
714603_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires the recognition of income tax consequences for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
714603_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 and requires modified retrospective application.
714603_18_ITEM8_P77_S2	We have evaluated the standard and concluded it will not impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
714603_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations.
714603_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted.
714603_18_ITEM8_P78_S2	The standard will be applied under the modified retrospective method, with elective reliefs, which requires application of the new guidance for all periods presented.
714603_18_ITEM8_P78_S3	We are currently evaluating the standard and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, however we currently expect that the most significant changes will be related to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, with no material impact to our Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which updates the reporting model for certain financial instruments, including the requirement for equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.
714603_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 and requires a cumulative-effective adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
714603_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	Beginning January 1, 2018, our private equity funds and other investments currently accounted for under the cost method, as well as our available-for-sale securities, will be measured at fair value each reporting period resulting in increased volatility in our Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	We expect to record a $34.7 million pre-tax increase to Investments and Stockholders Equity upon adoption of this guidance.
714603_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance which requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to clients in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
714603_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	The new standard and subsequently issued amendments is effective January 1, 2018.
714603_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	We will adopt the guidance using the modified retrospective transition approach.
714603_18_ITEM8_P81_S3	We continue to evaluate the impacts of the application of the new standard to our client contracts and expect the adoption of the standard will change the timing of when revenue is recognized for certain revenue streams.
714603_18_ITEM8_P81_S4	We currently anticipate that the majority of our contracts with clients that include account- and/or transaction-based processing fees will be accounted for under the series deliverable guidance in the new standard which will likely result in minimal changes as compared to our historical revenue recognition.
714603_18_ITEM8_P81_S5	These revenues will continue to be recognized over time as a single stand-ready performance obligation.
714603_18_ITEM8_P81_S6	As such, we do not currently anticipate significant changes in current systems or processes and do not believe there will be a material impact of adopting the new revenue standard on our consolidated financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	Significant Business Transactions and Events Significant Business Acquisitions Acquisition of the remaining interest in BFDS On March 27, 2017, we entered into a series of definitive agreements to acquire State Street s equity interest in our BFDS joint venture, which provides shareholder recordkeeping, intermediary and investor services, and regulatory compliance solutions to financial services clients in the United States.
714603_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	We also acquired an investment in a privately-held company and the equity interest in IFDS Realty, LLC, which holds the real estate assets used in BFDS operations, through a distribution from IFDS L.P., our 50 /50 joint venture with State Street.
714603_18_ITEM8_P82_S2	As a result of these transactions, we expect to enhance the strategic value we can provide to our clients through full service capabilities while also realizing internal synergies through increased scale and operational efficiencies.
714603_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	The BFDS transaction, which closed on March 30, 2017, was structured as a non taxable exchange under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code.
714603_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	At closing, DST delivered to State Street approximately 2.0 million shares of State Street common stock with a closing date fair value of $163.4 million (with a cost basis for tax purposes of approximately $1.1 million and a cost basis for book purposes of approximately $16.8 million ) in exchange for State Street s equity interest in BFDS.
714603_18_ITEM8_P83_S2	The number of shares delivered at closing was calculated using the negotiated fair value of $157.6 million and the closing price of State Street s stock at signing.
714603_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	BFDS is included within the Domestic Financial Services segment.
714603_18_ITEM8_P84_S1	The acquisition of State Street s 50% equity interest in BFDS was accounted for as a step-acquisition.
714603_18_ITEM8_P84_S2	Accordingly, we remeasured our previously held non-controlling equity interest in BFDS to the estimated fair value of $151.1 million , resulting in a gain of $56.0 million recorded at the acquisition date, within Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
714603_18_ITEM8_P84_S3	The fair value of the previously held equity interest in BFDS was determined using various valuation techniques, including market comparable transactions and discounted cash flow analysis adjusted for a control premium.

714603_18_ITEM8_P147_S0	______________________________________________________________________ (1) Other changes primarily consists of the impacts of foreign currency translation We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 and at other times if a significant change in circumstances indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced.
714603_18_ITEM8_P148_S0	The valuation of goodwill requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows, market multiples and discount rates.
714603_18_ITEM8_P148_S1	Our 2017 annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units.

714603_18_ITEM8_P152_S0	We have continuing involvement with the transferred assets because we maintain servicing responsibilities for the accounts receivable assets included in the accounts receivable securitization program.
714603_18_ITEM8_P152_S1	Accounts receivable assets transferred from us to our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary contain restrictions because they are not available to satisfy the creditors of any other person, including DST or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates.
714603_18_ITEM8_P152_S2	Further, neither we nor the SPE guarantees collectability of the receivables or the creditworthiness of obligors.
714603_18_ITEM8_P152_S3	The SPE retains an interest in the receivables in excess of the amount transferred to the conduit, and such receivables continue to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

714603_18_ITEM8_P152_S5	We believe increases in the level of assumed interest rates and/or credit losses compared to assumptions in effect at the balance sheet date by 10% or 20% would not materially affect the fair value of the retained interest at the reporting date.

714603_18_ITEM8_P158_S1	Interest on our outstanding 2017 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in January and July of each year, beginning in July 2018.
714603_18_ITEM8_P158_S2	We may prepay the senior notes at any time, in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes then outstanding, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole prepayment premium.
714603_18_ITEM8_P159_S0	Pursuant to terms of our senior note agreements, any Company subsidiary required to become a party to or otherwise guarantee the syndicated line of credit facility or other indebtedness in excess of $100.0 million , or in the case of the 2017 Senior Notes, certain other indebtedness in excess of $150.0 million , must also guarantee our obligations under the senior notes.
714603_18_ITEM8_P160_S0	The senior note agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, as well as certain customary events of default, including cross-default provisions.
714603_18_ITEM8_P160_S1	Among other provisions, the agreements limit our ability to incur or create liens, sell assets, issue priority indebtedness and change lines of business.
714603_18_ITEM8_P160_S2	The agreements also require certain leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained.
714603_18_ITEM8_P160_S3	We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P160_S4	Other indebtedness In connection with the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. during 2017, we assumed a mortgage with a principal amount of 23.0 million which matures in October 2020 ( U.K. mortgage ).
714603_18_ITEM8_P160_S5	The outstanding amount under the mortgage was $28.4 million at December 31, 2017 with a fixed interest rate of 3.1% .
714603_18_ITEM8_P160_S6	Principal payments of 1.0 million are payable semi-annually in April and October of each year and accrued interest is payable quarterly, with the outstanding balance due at maturity.
714603_18_ITEM8_P160_S7	Other indebtedness as of December 31, 2017 also included a $4.4 million mortgage acquired through a distribution of real estate and the related debt from Broadway Square Partners in December 2017 and $0.6 million of capital leases, offset by $2.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.
714603_18_ITEM8_P160_S8	Future principal payments of indebtedness at December 31, 2017 are as follows (in millions):
714603_18_ITEM8_P161_S0	The weighted average interest rates on our short-term borrowings were 2.72% and 2.36% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P161_S1	Based upon the borrowing rates currently available to us for indebtedness with similar terms and average maturities, the carrying value of long-term debt, with the exception of the senior notes and U.K. mortgage, is considered to approximate fair value at December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
714603_18_ITEM8_P161_S2	The estimated fair values of the senior notes and U.K. mortgage were derived principally from quoted prices (level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).
714603_18_ITEM8_P162_S0	The carrying and estimated fair values of our fixed rate debt were as follows (in millions):
714603_18_ITEM8_P163_S0	We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions.
714603_18_ITEM8_P163_S1	When determined appropriate, we use derivative instruments as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks.
714603_18_ITEM8_P163_S2	The primary market risks managed by us through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk.
714603_18_ITEM8_P163_S3	We may use various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts, option contracts and swaps.
714603_18_ITEM8_P163_S4	We do not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes.
714603_18_ITEM8_P163_S5	We determine the fair values of our derivatives based on quoted market prices that are directly or indirectly observable as further described within Note 7 , Fair Value Measurements .
714603_18_ITEM8_P163_S6	The fair value of our derivative instruments is reflected on a gross, rather than net, basis and is not significant to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 or 2016 .
714603_18_ITEM8_P164_S0	Cash flow hedging strategy We use cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.
714603_18_ITEM8_P164_S1	The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) and are reclassified into the line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.
714603_18_ITEM8_P164_S2	The changes in fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings.
714603_18_ITEM8_P165_S0	The length of time for which we hedge our exposure to future cash flows is typically one year.
714603_18_ITEM8_P166_S0	We have entered into a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our net cash outflows from intercompany purchases of services from our international subsidiaries could be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
714603_18_ITEM8_P166_S1	We entered into forward foreign currency contracts (Thai baht and India rupee) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies.
714603_18_ITEM8_P166_S2	The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for our foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $40.7 million and $14.3 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P167_S0	We monitor the mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly.
714603_18_ITEM8_P167_S1	From time to time, we manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments.
714603_18_ITEM8_P167_S2	We did not enter into interest rate swap agreements during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
714603_18_ITEM8_P167_S3	The pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on AOCI and earnings was not significant during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 .
714603_18_ITEM8_P167_S4	There were no gains or losses recognized into income as a result of hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
714603_18_ITEM8_P167_S5	As of December 31, 2017 , we estimate that amounts to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months are $0.2 million .
714603_18_ITEM8_P168_S0	In addition to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, we also use certain derivatives as economic hedges of foreign currency exposure.
714603_18_ITEM8_P168_S1	Although these derivatives were not designated for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges.
714603_18_ITEM8_P169_S0	The changes in fair values of economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings.
714603_18_ITEM8_P170_S0	We use foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on certain intercompany loans and other payables denominated in nonfunctional currencies, primarily the British pound and Australian dollar.
714603_18_ITEM8_P171_S0	The foreign currency economic hedging program consists of rolling, monthly forward foreign currency contracts which generally settle on the last day of each month.
714603_18_ITEM8_P171_S1	As a result, there are minimal unrealized gains or losses at the end of the period related to these contracts.
714603_18_ITEM8_P171_S2	The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency economic hedges were $60.4 million and $91.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P172_S0	Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), resulting in significant modifications to existing U.S. tax law, including but not limited to, (1) lowering the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018; (2) eliminating the domestic production activity deduction; (3) implementing a territorial tax system; and (4) imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
714603_18_ITEM8_P172_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse.
714603_18_ITEM8_P173_S0	Deferred tax expense (benefit) is generally the result of changes in the assets or liabilities for deferred taxes.
714603_18_ITEM8_P173_S1	As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Act, we revalued our ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $22.1 million tax benefit in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P174_S0	The Tax Act provides for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through the year ended December 31, 2017 ( Transition Tax ).
714603_18_ITEM8_P174_S1	We have estimated a provisional Transition Tax of $8.4 million , recorded to income tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P174_S2	The Transition Tax is payable over eight years and thus $7.3 million of the Transition Tax is reported as noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
714603_18_ITEM8_P175_S0	The Tax Act provides for a new requirement, beginning in 2018, that certain income earned by controlled foreign corporations in excess of an allowable return on foreign subsidiary s tangible assets is subject to U.S. income tax (the global intangible low-taxed income or GILTI provision).
714603_18_ITEM8_P175_S1	Also beginning in 2018, the Tax Act provides for a new base erosion and anti-abuse tax provision ( BEAT ) which eliminates the deduction of certain base-erosion payments made to related foreign corporations and imposes a minimum tax if greater than regular tax.
714603_18_ITEM8_P175_S2	We do not expect the GILTI or BEAT provisions to have a material impact to our financial statements and therefore, have not provided any tax impacts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P176_S0	The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118 ) which provides additional clarification regarding situations where the Company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act for the reporting period in which the Tax Act was enacted.
714603_18_ITEM8_P176_S1	We have recognized the provisional tax impacts, based on reasonable estimates, related to the Transition Tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and have included these amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P176_S2	The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.
714603_18_ITEM8_P177_S0	We intend to complete our accounting under the Tax Act within the measurement period set forth in SAB 118 .
714603_18_ITEM8_P178_S0	The following summarizes pretax income from continuing operations (in millions):
714603_18_ITEM8_P179_S0	Provision for income taxes (benefits) from continuing operations consists of the following components (in millions):
714603_18_ITEM8_P180_S0	Following are the reconciliations of our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal income tax statutory rate (in millions):
714603_18_ITEM8_P181_S0	The federal and state deferred tax assets (liabilities) recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows (in millions):
714603_18_ITEM8_P182_S0	We have approximately $4.1 million of federal net operating losses as of December 31, 2017 as a result of prior year business combinations.
714603_18_ITEM8_P182_S1	These net operating losses begin to expire in 2034 and are available to reduce future income taxes.
714603_18_ITEM8_P182_S2	Since these net operating losses were generated by an entity prior to its acquisition by DST, our utilization is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
714603_18_ITEM8_P182_S3	We do not anticipate that such limitations will prohibit the utilization of the federal net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration.
714603_18_ITEM8_P182_S4	We have approximately $48.4 million of state net operating losses as of December 31, 2017 .
714603_18_ITEM8_P182_S5	These net operating losses begin to expire in 2023.
714603_18_ITEM8_P182_S6	We have approximately $53.9 million of net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions as of December 31, 2017 .
714603_18_ITEM8_P182_S7	The carryforwards of $23.4 million in the U.K. do not expire but their utilization may be limited to offset only income with certain characteristics.
714603_18_ITEM8_P182_S8	The carryforwards of $13.1 million and $13.0 million in Ireland and Australia, respectively, do not expire.
714603_18_ITEM8_P182_S9	The carryforwards of $4.4 million in Canada begin to expire in 2032.
714603_18_ITEM8_P183_S0	A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
714603_18_ITEM8_P183_S1	In evaluating the realizability of certain international net deferred tax assets, we also anticipate that limitations may result in the benefit of these amounts not being realized and have established corresponding valuation allowances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $6.9 million and $5.7 million , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P183_S2	In evaluating certain state net operating losses, we anticipate that limitations may result in the benefit of these amounts not being realized and have established a corresponding valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $0.2 million and $0.3 million , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P184_S0	We provide deferred taxes for unremitted earnings of U.S. unconsolidated affiliates net of the 80% dividends received deduction provided for under current tax law.
714603_18_ITEM8_P184_S1	In connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in BFDS during March 2017, the corresponding deferred tax balance related to unremitted earnings of U.S. unconsolidated affiliates was reduced and no balance remains as of December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P184_S2	Deferred taxes provided on unremitted earnings through December 31, 2016 were $6.5 million .
714603_18_ITEM8_P184_S3	We record U.S. tax on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Distributions in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 resulted in incremental taxes of $1.0 million , $1.0 million and $1.9 million , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P184_S4	We recorded approximately $2.3 million and $2.6 million of related income tax liability, net of credits, on unremitted earnings in 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P184_S5	We intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings in the businesses of our other foreign subsidiaries.
714603_18_ITEM8_P184_S6	As of December 31, 2017 , accumulated undistributed earnings considered indefinitely reinvested were $186.2 million .
714603_18_ITEM8_P185_S0	The Tax Act generally eliminates U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries after December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P186_S0	undistributed earnings would only be subject to other taxes, such as withholding taxes and local taxes, on distribution of such earnings.
714603_18_ITEM8_P186_S1	Due to the uncertainty of the manner in which the undistributed earnings would be brought back to the U.S. and the withholding and local tax laws in effect at that time, it is not practicable for us to determine the income tax we would incur, if any, if such earnings were distributed.
714603_18_ITEM8_P187_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
714603_18_ITEM8_P188_S0	Included in the net unrecognized tax benefit at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were $43.6 million , $40.9 million and $42.0 million , respectively, of tax positions which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
714603_18_ITEM8_P188_S1	We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes, which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods.
714603_18_ITEM8_P188_S2	The liability for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits increased $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $13.1 million .
714603_18_ITEM8_P188_S3	The liability for interest and penalties decreased $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
714603_18_ITEM8_P188_S4	Although it is difficult to predict when all uncertain tax positions will reverse due to the unknown timing of the completion of examination periods, it is possible that aggregate income tax amounts of approximately $5.0 million to $7.0 million may reverse during 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P189_S0	We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
714603_18_ITEM8_P189_S1	An IRS examination for the tax year ended December 31, 2010 was completed in September 2015.
714603_18_ITEM8_P189_S2	Federal tax years 2012 through 2017 are subject to examination while various years from 2007 through 2017 are under or are subject to various state, local, and foreign income tax examinations by taxing authorities.
714603_18_ITEM8_P190_S0	We do not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on our financial statements.
714603_18_ITEM8_P191_S0	During 2015, the IRS completed its examination of the previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions, research and experimentation credits and capital losses for the period 2010.
714603_18_ITEM8_P191_S1	As a result, during 2015 we recognized income tax benefits of $11.9 million , resulting from the reversal of previously reserved tax positions related to these matters as well as other remeasurements during the period.
714603_18_ITEM8_P192_S0	An IRS examination for the tax year ended December 31, 2014 began during 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P192_S1	An IRS examination of BFDS for the tax year ended December 31, 2015 (when BFDS was an unconsolidated affiliate) began during 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P193_S0	On May 9, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a two -for-one stock split of DST s outstanding common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend, which was paid on June 8, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 26, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM8_P193_S1	In connection with the stock split, 16.5 million treasury shares were used to settle a portion of the distribution.
714603_18_ITEM8_P193_S2	The distribution of treasury shares during the year ended December 31, 2017 reduced Additional paid in capital by $40.5 million , Retained earnings by $1,297.2 million and Treasury stock by $1,337.9 million .

714603_18_ITEM8_P194_S0	Earnings per share The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):
714603_18_ITEM8_P195_S0	We had approximately 59.3 million and 64.0 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P195_S1	There were no shares from options to purchase common stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
714603_18_ITEM8_P196_S0	We have authorized 10.0 million shares of preferred stock, of which no shares are currently issued or outstanding.

714603_18_ITEM8_P198_S9	One of our unconsolidated affiliates has an interest rate swap liability with a fair market value of $25.5 million , $33.1 million and $44.7 million at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P198_S10	The unconsolidated affiliate used inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are directly or indirectly observable relating to the measurement of the interest rate swap.
714603_18_ITEM8_P198_S11	Our 50% proportionate share of this interest rate swap liability was $12.8 million , $16.5 million and $22.4 million at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P198_S12	We record in investments and AOCI our proportionate share of this liability in an amount not to exceed the carrying value of our investment in this unconsolidated affiliate.
714603_18_ITEM8_P198_S13	Because the carrying value of this unconsolidated affiliate investment balance was zero at December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015, no interest rate swap liability or change in AOCI was recorded for these periods.
714603_18_ITEM8_P199_S0	Stock repurchases and retirements As of December 31, 2016, we had $150.0 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase plan authorized in 2016.
714603_18_ITEM8_P199_S1	On May 9, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $300.0 million share repurchase plan, which allows, but does not require, the repurchase of common stock in open market and private transactions.
714603_18_ITEM8_P199_S2	We repurchased the equivalent of 5.0 million shares of our common stock on a post stock split basis for $300.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 , which left approximately $150.0 million remaining under our share repurchase plan authorized in 2017 .
714603_18_ITEM8_P199_S3	The 2017 share repurchase plan does not have an expiration date, however we are currently precluded from executing additional stock repurchases pursuant to the Merger Agreement with SS C, as further described in Note 1, Description of Business.
714603_18_ITEM8_P199_S4	Under previous share repurchase plans, we expended $300.0 million for approximately 5.4 million shares on a post stock split basis and $400.0 million for approximately 7.2 million shares on a post stock split basis during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
714603_18_ITEM8_P199_S5	Shares received in exchange for tax withholding obligations and payment of the exercise price arising from the exercise of options to purchase our stock or from the vesting of equity awards are included in common stock repurchased in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

714603_18_ITEM8_P205_S1	PSUs are granted at a target number of shares and generally vest at the end of a 3 -year requisite service and performance period.

714603_18_ITEM11_P2_S0	The discussion below relates to DST s compensation policies prior to the Company s entry into the Merger Agreement with SS C in January 2018.

714603_18_ITEM11_P2_S2	All references to the Committee in this CD A refer to the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.
714603_18_ITEM11_P3_S0	Executive pay philosophy The Company s business strategy for creating growth has been to leverage the capabilities of its employees to execute its growth strategy while remaining committed to maintaining a strong financial position with appropriate flexibility and liquidity.
714603_18_ITEM11_P3_S1	Our compensation philosophy has supported this strategy by stressing the importance of pay for corporate and individual performance in meeting strategic and business goals for growth, value creation and financial strength, while maintaining flexibility to meet the changing employee, business and market conditions.
714603_18_ITEM11_P3_S2	Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain a talented team of executives who are expected to provide leadership for the Company s success in a challenging business environment.
714603_18_ITEM11_P3_S3	The Company has accomplished this by motivating executives with an appropriate mix of compensation elements described below.
714603_18_ITEM11_P3_S4	Objectives of our Executive Compensation Program We have used the following principles to determine our Executive Compensation Program:
714603_18_ITEM11_P4_S0	Attract, Retain, and Motivate High Performing Executives: Our executive base salaries and target incentive compensation opportunities are designed to be market competitive so that we can attract, retain, and motivate individuals who will drive superior business performance.
714603_18_ITEM11_P5_S0	We seek to build and support a performance driven culture by incorporating an at risk component into a significant portion of each executive s pay.
714603_18_ITEM11_P5_S1	The at risk component varies based on individual responsibility levels as well as organizational and, as applicable, business unit performance results.
714603_18_ITEM11_P6_S0	Align with Stockholder Interests: The majority of NEO compensation is tied to organizational performance and is, therefore, at risk.
714603_18_ITEM11_P7_S0	We have historically incorporated into our program two performance based compensation vehicles that align executive compensation with creation of stockholder value.
714603_18_ITEM11_P8_S0	This annual opportunity rewards performance as measured by achievement against pre set annual financial goals.
714603_18_ITEM11_P9_S0	Long Term Equity Incentive: Our equity grants have aligned executive and stockholder interests in long term stock appreciation.
714603_18_ITEM11_P10_S0	Our compensation is designed to motivate and inspire behavior that fosters a high-performance culture while upholding our corporate governance standards and avoiding unreasonable risk.
714603_18_ITEM11_P10_S1	Since talent is critical to our long term success, we seek to pay executives at levels that are competitive with other employers with whom we compete for talent.
714603_18_ITEM11_P10_S2	Our goal has been to target executive compensation, on average, to be at the median of this market, with the opportunity to earn above market compensation for superior performance within any given year or performance period.
714603_18_ITEM11_P10_S3	Our program incorporates several features that seek to drive business performance over both the short and long term.
714603_18_ITEM11_P10_S4	A higher percentage of total compensation is at risk for the most senior levels in order to reflect the additional responsibilities associated with these positions.
714603_18_ITEM11_P11_S0	Help attract and retain high-caliber executive talent.
714603_18_ITEM11_P12_S0	The Committee targets NEO base salaries at the median of the industry peer group benchmark data, but also takes into account each NEO s responsibilities, leadership, tenure, and retention risk.
714603_18_ITEM11_P12_S1	Base salaries for the NEOs are reviewed annually for potential adjustments.
714603_18_ITEM11_P13_S0	An at risk, performance based compensation component.
714603_18_ITEM11_P14_S0	Align the interests of executives and stockholders by providing compensation based on the achievement of pre determined annual financial goals.
714603_18_ITEM11_P15_S0	For 2017, for each of our NEOs other than Mr. Burke, 60% of annual incentive performance was based on Adjusted EPS performance, with the remaining 40% tied to Adjusted Operating Revenue.
714603_18_ITEM11_P16_S0	Threshold, target, and maximum goals were established in early 2017, with payout opportunities ranging from 0% to 150% of target for each of our NEOs other than Mr. Burke.
714603_18_ITEM11_P17_S0	Mr. Burke participated in a separate ALPS annual cash incentive plan (discussed below), which was designed to reward achievement based upon ALPS and Company financial performance.
714603_18_ITEM11_P18_S0	Align NEO and stockholder interests through the appreciation of stock price over the long-term.
714603_18_ITEM11_P19_S0	The Company uses a combination of at risk Performance Stock Units ( PSUs ) and time-vesting Restricted Stock Units ( Time-Based RSUs ) to provide NEOs with a performance and retention incentive opportunity.
714603_18_ITEM11_P20_S0	In keeping with our pay for performance philosophy, we apportioned the aggregate grant date fair value of long-term incentives to each NEO so that two thirds is in the form of PSUs and one third is in the form of Time-Based RSUs.
714603_18_ITEM11_P21_S0	PSUs vest based on performance against a pre determined three year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA goal.
714603_18_ITEM11_P22_S0	Threshold, target, and maximum goals were established in early 2017 for the 2017-2019 performance period, with payout opportunities ranging from 0% to 200% of target for PSUs granted in 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P23_S0	Time-Based RSUs vest annually in equal one third increments.
714603_18_ITEM11_P24_S0	Deliver limited benefits and perquisites to executives.
714603_18_ITEM11_P25_S0	Because we provide limited perquisites, we do not believe that they are material to our overall compensation program.
714603_18_ITEM11_P25_S1	We do not provide gross-ups for NEO perquisites.
714603_18_ITEM11_P26_S0	Pay-for-Performance Our philosophy has been to link pay to performance so that the interests of our executives and stockholders are aligned.
714603_18_ITEM11_P26_S1	A significant portion of our NEOs total compensation reflects both upside and downside risk.
714603_18_ITEM11_P26_S2	The portion of the compensation of the CEO and other NEOs that is considered at-risk, ( i.e. , tied to Company performance over the short and/or long term) has historically exceeded the fixed portion.
714603_18_ITEM11_P26_S3	We have historically provided that a greater percentage of the CEO s compensation is at-risk than the other NEOs.
714603_18_ITEM11_P26_S4	We have set goals based on growth objectives, our mix of businesses, projections, and competitive outlooks.
714603_18_ITEM11_P27_S0	We believe the additional emphasis on at-risk compensation for the CEO (when compared to the other NEOs) reflects his additional responsibility and overall contribution to Company performance.
714603_18_ITEM11_P27_S1	65% of our CEO s compensation and 61% of our other NEO s compensation is considered at-risk.
714603_18_ITEM11_P27_S2	Risk Taking Our compensation program is designed to put pay at-risk for performance while at the same time discouraging unnecessary risk-taking.
714603_18_ITEM11_P27_S3	The Committee evaluates the potential for unacceptable risk-taking when designing the compensation program.
714603_18_ITEM11_P27_S4	We believe that the design of our executive compensation program does not encourage excessive risk-taking or incent our NEOs to take actions that may conflict with our risk-based decision making.
714603_18_ITEM11_P27_S5	Material risk in our compensation design is mitigated in several ways:
714603_18_ITEM11_P28_S0	We have adopted a clawback policy.
714603_18_ITEM11_P28_S1	In addition, we have policies in place that prohibit our NEOs from pledging or hedging shares of Company securities owned by them.
714603_18_ITEM11_P29_S0	The processes and procedures for determining executive officer compensation are written and were approved by the Committee.
714603_18_ITEM11_P30_S0	The Committee is responsible for and has the authority under its charter to determine the components of executive officer compensation.
714603_18_ITEM11_P30_S1	In support of its pay-for-performance philosophy, the Committee has tied a significant portion of executive officer compensation to the creation of stockholder value over the long term, structured executive officer compensation so that a significant portion of total compensation is at-risk rather than fixed, and used balanced performance goals that incent both short-term and long-term business results.
714603_18_ITEM11_P31_S0	The Committee reviews executive officer compensation annually.
714603_18_ITEM11_P31_S1	For each review, the Committee may consider, and decide the weight it will give to, among other things, any combination of the following:
714603_18_ITEM11_P32_S0	effects of a potential severance, change in control or other transaction.
714603_18_ITEM11_P33_S0	The Committee has historically utilized the services of an independent compensation consultant.
714603_18_ITEM11_P33_S1	As described below, the independent compensation consultant has provided various data, analyses, and advice to the Committee on executive compensation matters.
714603_18_ITEM11_P33_S2	In addition, the Committee may request our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Human Resources Officer recommend compensation package components.
714603_18_ITEM11_P33_S3	Such officers communicate executive hiring and retention concerns to the Committee.
714603_18_ITEM11_P33_S4	The Committee may ask the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel to provide the Committee with:
714603_18_ITEM11_P34_S0	Company performance data and individual performance evaluations.
714603_18_ITEM11_P34_S1	The Committee develops the criteria for evaluating Chief Executive Officer performance and annually reviews his performance against such criteria.
714603_18_ITEM11_P34_S2	The Chief Executive Officer periodically discusses with the Committee his view of the performance of the other executive officers.
714603_18_ITEM11_P34_S3	The 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan permits the Committee to delegate certain administrative matters, and the Committee has made administrative delegations to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, and Chief Financial Officer.
714603_18_ITEM11_P34_S4	The Committee and the Board rely on the Chief Human Resources Officer to implement compensation decisions and adopt appropriate compensation policies, procedures, and internal controls.
714603_18_ITEM11_P35_S0	2017 Compensation Details Annual base salaries The following table shows the base salaries of each NEO and summarizes their 2017 base salary increases.
714603_18_ITEM11_P35_S1	Increases shown below were based on considerations including: the relative position of the individual to the market competitive benchmarks, individual performance, and retention considerations.
714603_18_ITEM11_P36_S0	Annual cash incentives The following table summarizes the 2017 annual cash incentive opportunity levels for the CEO and other NEOs as a percentage of base salary (other than Mr. Burke who participated in the ALPS annual cash incentive plan discussed below).
714603_18_ITEM11_P37_S0	The following table summarizes the 2017 annual incentive payout curve as a percentage of target goal achievement and states the corresponding weighted financial goals.
714603_18_ITEM11_P38_S0	______________________________________________________________________ (1) Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS for the reporting period as reflected in the audited financial statements, adjusted for the effect of certain predetermined adjustments, as described below.
714603_18_ITEM11_P38_S1	(2) Adjusted Operating Revenue is defined as consolidated operating revenue for the reporting period as reflected in the audited financial statements, adjusted for certain predetermined adjustments, as described below.
714603_18_ITEM11_P39_S0	For the 2017 performance year, the annual incentive goal result was as follows:
714603_18_ITEM11_P40_S0	_______________________________________________________________________ (1) The following pre determined adjustments affected the level of achievement relating to EPS Goals: effect of repurchased shares, sale or impairment of non operating assets, expense recognized related to restructuring charges for non-GAAP results, the impact of strategic transactions, including results of operations and related transactional costs, the impact of changes in GAAP, and an additional adjustment for loss of a client.
714603_18_ITEM11_P40_S1	The following pre determined adjustments affected the level of achievement relating to Operating Revenue Goals: the impact of strategic transactions and an additional adjustment for loss of a client.
714603_18_ITEM11_P40_S2	The following table summarizes the annual cash incentives awarded for the 2017 performance period for our NEOs (other than Mr. Burke who participated in the ALPS annual cash incentive plan discussed below):
714603_18_ITEM11_P41_S0	Mr. Burke serves as President of ALPS and, therefore, participated in the ALPS annual cash incentive plan.
714603_18_ITEM11_P42_S0	The ALPS annual cash incentive plan is an at-risk performance-based program designed to reward achievement based upon ALPS and DST financial performance.
714603_18_ITEM11_P42_S1	The size of the annual ALPS bonus pool is determined based upon several financial measures, and participants are granted the right to receive a specified percentage of the pool.
714603_18_ITEM11_P42_S2	For 2017, the incentive bonus pool initially equaled 17.5% of ALPS pre-bonus Adjusted EBITDA, subject to three adjustments: (i) 20% of the pool amount was subject to increase or decrease based upon achievement of the Adjusted EPS Goals under the 2017 DST cash incentive plan (disclosed above), (ii) the amount of the bonus pool was reduced by the increase in matching payments under the 401(k) plan to ALPS employees due to an increase in the percentage of contributions matched in 2017, and (iii) the bonus pool was subject to increase based upon achieving 30% year-over-year ALPS pre-bonus Adjusted EBITDA growth, which was not achieved for 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P42_S3	Mr. Burke s annual incentive for 2017 equaled 10% of the adjusted bonus pool, by agreement established at date of hire.
714603_18_ITEM11_P42_S4	For 2017, Mr. Burke's annual cash incentive award under the plan was $894,795, which reflects his percentage of the bonus pool as increased based upon achievement of the maximum Adjusted EPS Goals for DST.
714603_18_ITEM11_P43_S0	Long term equity incentives - PSUs and Time-Based RSUs DST is committed to pay-for-performance and ensuring the alignment of our executives and our stockholders interests.
714603_18_ITEM11_P44_S0	Equity awards have historically been made at the first regularly scheduled Committee meeting of the year.
714603_18_ITEM11_P44_S1	Any subsequent awards for onboarding, promotions, or special rewards are generally made at regularly scheduled Committee meetings.
714603_18_ITEM11_P45_S0	Performance stock units Two thirds of 2017 equity awards were in the form of PSUs and are subject to the following terms, including a challenging performance metric that prevents awards from vesting if Adjusted EBITDA targets are not met:
714603_18_ITEM11_P46_S0	Vesting of PSUs is based on performance against pre determined cumulative Adjusted EBITDA goals at the end of a three year performance period.
714603_18_ITEM11_P47_S0	If the threshold goal is not achieved, no vesting occurs, no shares are issued, and all PSUs are forfeited.
714603_18_ITEM11_P48_S0	If the threshold goal is achieved, the number of shares to be issued is 50% for awards granted before 2016, and 25% for awards granted in 2016 and in subsequent years, of the target number of units, and the remaining PSUs are forfeited.
714603_18_ITEM11_P49_S0	If the target goal is achieved, the number of shares to be issued equals the target number of units granted.
714603_18_ITEM11_P50_S0	If the maximum goal is achieved, the number of shares to be issued equals 150% for awards granted before 2016 and 200% for awards granted in 2016 and in subsequent years, of the target number of units granted.
714603_18_ITEM11_P51_S0	Linear interpolation is used to determine the number of shares to be issued between goal levels (so that, for instance, there could be 54%, or 123%, of the target number vesting).
714603_18_ITEM11_P52_S0	Time-based restricted stock units One-third of the 2017 equity awards were granted to our NEOs in the form of Time-Based RSUs that vest annually in one-third increments.
714603_18_ITEM11_P52_S1	Grants awarded in 2017 This table shows the aggregate grant date fair value of the 2017 long-term incentive grants and the allocation of the awards between PSUs and Time-Based RSUs for each NEO.
714603_18_ITEM11_P53_S0	_______________________________________________________________________ (1) The grant date fair value shown for each individual was calculated by dividing by the average of the highest and lowest reported sale price of DST stock on February 24, 2017, which was $59.165.
714603_18_ITEM11_P54_S0	Vesting of 2015-2017 PSUs The following table summarizes the vesting as a percentage of the target number of units for all NEOs as well as the corresponding financial goals for the 2015-2017 performance cycle:
714603_18_ITEM11_P55_S0	_______________________________________________________________________ (1) EBITDA is defined as cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as reflected in the audited financial statements for the three year performance period ended December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P55_S1	EBITDA as defined for the equity grants excludes the cost of equity compensation.
714603_18_ITEM11_P55_S2	Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of the 2015-2017 plan reflects pre determined adjustments that are to be made to the level of EBITDA goal achievement.
714603_18_ITEM11_P55_S3	These adjustments include: the sale or impairment of non-operating assets (investment or real estate); the sale of a subsidiary to a third party; and the acquisition of the remaining interests in a joint venture.
714603_18_ITEM11_P56_S0	As shown above, the threshold performance level was not obtained for the 2015-2017 performance cycle and, therefore, the awards were forfeited for this performance period.
714603_18_ITEM11_P57_S0	Peer group Benchmarking data is gathered and presented to the Committee by its independent compensation consultant, Deloitte Consulting LLP ( Deloitte ).
714603_18_ITEM11_P57_S1	Deloitte supplements peer group data with published survey data from general industry and computer and data processing companies of a similar financial size.
714603_18_ITEM11_P57_S2	The Committee has developed an industry peer group of similarly-sized companies in the data processing and software services industries in order to assess competitive market compensation levels for the NEOs.
714603_18_ITEM11_P57_S3	The following fifteen companies comprised the industry peer group used to benchmark compensation awarded for 2017: Alliance Data Systems Corporation Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Convergys Corporation Corelogic, Inc. CSG Systems International, Inc. Euronet Worldwide, Inc.
714603_18_ITEM11_P57_S4	NCR Corporation Jack Henry Associates, Inc.
714603_18_ITEM11_P57_S5	Teletech Holdings Inc. MoneyGram International, Inc. Verifone Systems, Inc. Total System Services, Inc.
714603_18_ITEM11_P58_S0	The 2017 peer group was the same peer group used for 2016, except that Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. was removed from the 2017 peer group as it was acquired in 2016.
714603_18_ITEM11_P59_S0	Role of the compensation consultant and management Deloitte provided various data, analyses, and advice to the Committee on executive compensation matters during 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P59_S1	Deloitte reports directly to the Committee and attends Committee meetings as requested.
714603_18_ITEM11_P59_S2	In 2017, such services included benchmarking executive compensation, providing competitive information on incentive plan practices, reviewing the 2017 Compensation Discussion and Analysis, and reviewing peer group compensation practices.
714603_18_ITEM11_P59_S3	The Committee welcomes the CEO s input as it designs NEO compensation programs and sets the compensation of the other NEOs.
714603_18_ITEM11_P59_S4	However, the CEO is not present during discussions at Committee meetings or between the Committee and Deloitte regarding his compensation.
714603_18_ITEM11_P59_S5	The Committee alone makes decisions about the amounts and forms of NEO compensation, and its decisions may reflect factors and considerations other than information and advice from the CEO, Deloitte, and members of management.
714603_18_ITEM11_P59_S6	Flexibility in determining compensation The Committee considers market benchmark compensation data for individual positions, considers additional information from management when setting pay levels, and has also considered:
714603_18_ITEM11_P60_S0	the performance of individual NEOs, including, but not limited to, the ability to meet business challenges strategically, plan long-range, achieve short-term and long-term financial results, lead and develop a team for which the officer is responsible, prudently steward our business and operational resources, and promote legal and ethical compliance.
714603_18_ITEM11_P61_S0	The Committee does not follow precise formulas when determining NEO compensation levels.
714603_18_ITEM11_P61_S1	Rather, it considers whether the various components of our compensation programs justify the cost to the Company and provide value to our stockholders.
714603_18_ITEM11_P62_S0	Benefits and perquisites Severance Benefits NEOs without an employment agreement (Messrs. Givens, Boehm, Burke, and Lark) participate in our Executive Severance Plan, which provides severance benefits for terminations of employment by DST for reasons other than cause, death or disability (as those are defined in the Executive Severance Plan).
714603_18_ITEM11_P62_S1	DST s obligation to provide payments and benefits under the Executive Severance Plan is conditioned upon the executive providing and not revoking a release of claims and complying with the applicable non competition, non solicitation, and non disclosure covenants.
714603_18_ITEM11_P62_S2	Mr. Hooley is party to an employment agreement with the Company that provides for severance benefits that are different than those contained in the Executive Severance Plan.
714603_18_ITEM11_P62_S3	For additional detail on the Executive Severance Plan and the severance benefits payable under Mr. Hooley s employment agreements, see Termination Payments and Potential Termination Payments.
714603_18_ITEM11_P63_S0	Perquisites We provide NEOs with a modest level of perquisites to promote convenience in the performance of duties for the Company.
714603_18_ITEM11_P63_S1	In 2017, we allowed Mr. Hooley limited personal use of aircraft in which we own fractional interests.
714603_18_ITEM11_P63_S2	Generally when his family accompanies him on such flights there is no incremental cost.
714603_18_ITEM11_P63_S3	The Committee monitors personal use through receipt of reports from our CFO at least four times per year.
714603_18_ITEM11_P63_S4	NEOs may also receive estate planning services, tax return services, excess liability insurance, long-term disability insurance and paid parking.
714603_18_ITEM11_P64_S0	We reimburse spouse or guest travel to and from, and family entertainment at, off-site planning meetings at which NEOs and their spouses or guests interact with each other and with members of the Board and their spouses or guests.
714603_18_ITEM11_P64_S1	We do not gross-up NEO perquisites for tax liabilities.
714603_18_ITEM11_P64_S2	We allow full or partial accelerated vesting of equity awards upon death, disability, retirement and in other limited termination of employment circumstances as described under Termination Payments and Potential Termination Payments.
714603_18_ITEM11_P64_S3	These benefits aid NEOs in the event of health crises, aid their families in the event of their deaths, help NEOs plan for retirement, and balance the Board s flexibility in making management changes or effecting transactions which could result in an NEOs involuntary termination of employment.
714603_18_ITEM11_P65_S0	Insurance Benefits NEOs participate in group health, vision, and dental insurance plans on the same basis as other employees.
714603_18_ITEM11_P65_S1	We offer NEOs the opportunity to apply for individual variable life insurance policies in lieu of participation in our employee group life policy.
714603_18_ITEM11_P65_S2	The policies are portable and allow NEOs to accrue cash value.
714603_18_ITEM11_P66_S0	We provide NEOs with a long term disability policy on the same basis as other employees.
714603_18_ITEM11_P66_S1	Some NEOs also have an individual long-term disability policy that is portable.
714603_18_ITEM11_P66_S2	This is a closed class of individuals and is a benefit no longer offered to new NEOs.
714603_18_ITEM11_P66_S3	We also provide a closed class of NEOs with coverage under a group excess liability insurance policy.
714603_18_ITEM11_P66_S4	These benefits aid NEOs in the event of a personal liability lawsuit to preserve assets such as auto and home.
714603_18_ITEM11_P67_S0	Our award agreements provide generally for full vesting of unvested deferred cash and equity awards upon a double trigger ( i.e ., a change in control followed by a qualifying termination of employment).
714603_18_ITEM11_P67_S1	We believe these protections promote stability during a change in control by encouraging our executives to cooperate with and achieve a change in control approved by the Board without being distracted by the possibility of termination or demotion following the transaction.
714603_18_ITEM11_P67_S2	All NEOs are entitled to severance benefits for certain terminations within a limited period of time following a change in control, either as a result of their employment agreement (Mr. Hooley) or their participation in the Executive Severance Plan (Messrs. Givens, Boehm, Burke and Lark), as further described under Termination Payments and Potential Termination Payments.
714603_18_ITEM11_P67_S3	Consummation of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement entered into with SS C would result in a change of control for purposes of the Executive Severance Plan, Mr. Hooley's employment agreement and award agreements with our NEOs.
714603_18_ITEM11_P68_S0	Say on Pay At the 2017 Annual Meeting, the percentage of the votes cast in favor of the Say on Pay proposal was 94.87%, indicating stockholder confidence in our pay-for-performance philosophy.
714603_18_ITEM11_P68_S1	The Committee considered the strong support of our stockholders in evaluating the design of the executive compensation program and making subsequent compensation determinations.
714603_18_ITEM11_P69_S0	Clawback policy To mitigate the risk that incentives would be based on erroneous financial results, executive officers that receive incentive compensation, including our NEOs, are subject to our clawback policy.
714603_18_ITEM11_P69_S1	The policy mandates Company recoupment of various award amounts in the event of certain accounting restatements.
714603_18_ITEM11_P69_S2	Such a restatement would trigger the return (or clawback) of incentive compensation for 2017 performance resulting from the Company s material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws.
714603_18_ITEM11_P69_S3	The amount to be returned would equal the portion of a covered annual and/or long term incentive award in excess of what would have been paid if the results as stated in the restated financials had applied to the award determination.
714603_18_ITEM11_P69_S4	If a clawback is triggered, NEOs would be required to return the value of their covered awards, or a portion thereof, regardless of whether their individual conduct contributed to the financial restatement.
714603_18_ITEM11_P69_S5	The policy also allows the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, to clawback incentive compensation in the event of either a significant ethics policy violation or of non compliance with a restrictive covenant such as a non disclosure, non competition, or non solicitation obligation, or an obligation to protect and take other actions with respect to Company intellectual property.
714603_18_ITEM11_P70_S0	The annual and long term incentive plans are both governed by our 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan.
714603_18_ITEM11_P70_S1	We obtained approval of the Plan by our stockholders, in order to facilitate the potential deductibility of performance based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
714603_18_ITEM11_P70_S2	Our primary focus has been applying our executive compensation philosophy in order to attract, retain, and incent our NEOs, and we have reserved the right to determine whether to utilize the performance based compensation exemption in Section 162(m) in making compensation determinations.
714603_18_ITEM11_P70_S3	To facilitate the potential deductibility under the performance-based compensation exemption, the Committee has historically determined NEO participation in the annual short term cash incentive program, made PSU grants to NEOs, and set performance goals for NEO awards within the first ninety days of a performance year.
714603_18_ITEM11_P70_S4	It has also determined prior to the end of a performance year whether to make adjustments to performance goals or award payouts if a non recurring or unexpected event occurs during a performance period.
714603_18_ITEM11_P71_S0	The Tax Act enacted in December 2017 made a number of changes to Section 162(m), including eliminating the performance-based compensation exemption effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, except with respect to compensation that qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P71_S1	Because of the uncertainties associated with the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and the regulations issued thereunder, including the uncertain scope of the transition relief under the Tax Act, it is uncertain whether compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for deductibility under Section 162(m) will in fact be deductible.
714603_18_ITEM11_P72_S0	Chief Executive Officer matters Employment agreement Mr. Hooley s legacy employment agreement, governed by the laws of Missouri, was entered into June 30, 2009 and does not provide for employment through a set date.
714603_18_ITEM11_P72_S1	Prior to approving the agreement, we reviewed leading market and industry practice regarding appropriate and common provisions for executives in senior leadership positions.
714603_18_ITEM11_P72_S2	The agreement entitles him to a base salary of at least $550,000 and provides that he is to receive an incentive program opportunity as determined by the Compensation Committee.
714603_18_ITEM11_P72_S3	Under the employment agreement, during the three years after a change in control, which we refer to as the Three-year Period, if Mr. Hooley s employment is terminated by DST without cause or if he resigns for good reason, then Mr. Hooley is entitled to receive the following amounts:
714603_18_ITEM11_P73_S0	Benefits : The employment agreement contemplates continued employment during the Three-Year Period and continued participation in DST s benefit plans, which we refer to as the Specified Benefits, on the basis of Mr. Hooley s participation on the date of the change in control; or, in the alternative, other plans which are at least equivalent to those in effect on the change in control.
714603_18_ITEM11_P74_S0	Termination following Change in Control :
714603_18_ITEM11_P74_S1	Under his employment agreement, after a change in control, if Mr. Hooley s employment is terminated by DST without cause or if the executive resigns for Good Reason (as defined below), then Mr. Hooley is entitled to receive a lump sum payment (payable within five days following the termination date) equal to the salary he would have received for the remainder of the Three-Year Period (but in no event less than one year) and continued benefits for such length of time; provided that: (a) if any plan pursuant to which Specified Benefits are provided immediately prior to termination would not permit continued participation, then DST will pay a lump sum equal (within five days following the termination date) to the amount of Specified Benefits that Mr. Hooley would have received if he was fully vested and a continuing participant in such plan until the end of the severance period; (b) if Mr. Hooley obtains new employment following termination, then after any waiting period applicable to participation in any plan of the new employer, he will continue to be entitled to receive benefits only to the extent such benefits would exceed those available under comparable plans of the new employer; and (c) Mr. Hooley is entitled a lump sum equal to the aggregate amount of the annual incentives he would have received if target goals had been met for each year of the Three-Year Period (prorated for the final performance year if the Three-Year Period ends partially through a performance year).
714603_18_ITEM11_P75_S0	Certain 280G Gross-ups : Mr. Hooley s employment agreement provides for payment of a gross-up relating to the parachute payment tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.
714603_18_ITEM11_P75_S1	For Mr. Hooley, the parachute payment is generally subject to a scaleback equal to the largest amount that can be paid without triggering the parachute tax.
714603_18_ITEM11_P75_S2	If the payment is scaled back, there would be no parachute tax and no gross-up payment.
714603_18_ITEM11_P75_S3	However, if Mr. Hooley would retain, after tax, more than 120% of the amount he would retain if the potential parachute payments were scaled back, the cap does not apply and he is entitled to a gross-up payment, not to exceed five times the parachute tax.
714603_18_ITEM11_P76_S0	Mr. Hooley has entered into a separation agreement, pursuant to which, upon the Effective Time of the Merger, Mr. Hooley's employment with DST will be terminated for "good reason" (pursuant to his employment agreement as described above).
714603_18_ITEM11_P76_S1	In satisfaction of all obligations of DST under his employment agreement (as described above), Mr. Hooley will receive the cash severance and benefits described above on the closing date.
714603_18_ITEM11_P76_S2	In addition, in lieu of conversion of any of Mr. Hooley's outstanding RSUs and PSUs into SS C equity awards in the Merger (as described in "Treatment of Equity Awards and Long-Term Cash Awards Under Merger Agreement") such awards shall be converted into cash (based upon a cash price of $84.00 per share) and paid in a cash lump sum on the closing date, provided, that to the extent that any such cash award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, the cash payment will be paid subject to any six month delay required by Section 409A.
714603_18_ITEM11_P77_S0	The employment agreement and the separation agreement are further addressed in Termination Payments and Potential Termination Payments.
714603_18_ITEM11_P78_S0	Stock ownership guidelines To further align CEO and stockholder interests, we have guidelines that the CEO must maintain stock ownership of at least six times his base salary.
714603_18_ITEM11_P78_S1	Mr. Hooley has reached the ownership threshold.
714603_18_ITEM11_P79_S0	Merger Agreement and 2018 Compensation As a result of the Merger Agreement entered into with SS C, DST s compensation policies for our NEOs have been adjusted with respect to compensation awarded or paid for 2018.
714603_18_ITEM11_P79_S1	These adjustments have been made so that 2018 compensation will comply with the Merger Agreement and will achieve the relevant objectives of our compensation program prior to consummation of the Merger as determined by the Committee.
714603_18_ITEM11_P79_S2	The Merger Agreement with SS C prohibits, among other things, base salary increases for our NEOs.
714603_18_ITEM11_P79_S3	See Treatment of Equity Awards and Long-Term Cash Awards Under Merger Agreement for information regarding the treatment of equity awards in the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM11_P80_S0	Employee Compensation Risk The Committee determines whether employee compensation policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
714603_18_ITEM11_P80_S1	The Committee obtains information from the Chief Human Resources Officer regarding corporate, business unit, domestic, international, incentive, equity, sales commission, and other programs and considers controls such as benchmarking, setting goals and award limits, and receiving assistance from independent compensation consultants.
714603_18_ITEM11_P80_S2	In December 2017, the Committee determined that our employee compensation practices and policies do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
714603_18_ITEM11_P81_S0	Compensation Committee Report We reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Form 10-K. Based on such review and discussion, we recommended to the Board that this Form 10-K include the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
714603_18_ITEM11_P82_S0	The information contained in the Compensation Committee Report shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference in such filing.
714603_18_ITEM11_P83_S0	_______________________________________________________________________ (1) The amounts in the Stock Awards column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value for each respective fiscal year related to both Time-Based RSUs and PSUs granted in 2017, 2016, and 2015.
714603_18_ITEM11_P83_S1	All fair values were computed in accordance with the applicable Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Stock Compensation topic.
714603_18_ITEM11_P83_S2	Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are described in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
714603_18_ITEM11_P83_S3	Amounts reported include the value of PSUs based on the probable outcome of performance conditions at 100% on the grant date.
714603_18_ITEM11_P83_S4	If PSUs had been valued at maximum level of performance, the aggregate grant date fair value for all 2017 awards would have been $7,609,802 for Mr. Hooley; $1,690,936 for Mr. Givens; $2,029,241 for Mr. Boehm; $1,268,261 for Mr. Burke; and $1,860,148 for Mr. Lark.
714603_18_ITEM11_P84_S0	The Time-Based RSU and PSU vesting terms and conditions are described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis - 2017 Compensation Details - Long Term Equity Incentives - PSUs and Time-Based RSUs and Termination Payments and Potential Termination Payments.

714603_18_ITEM11_P87_S0	We no longer defer any portion of the annual incentive award.
714603_18_ITEM11_P87_S1	(3) All Other Compensation includes amounts for various types of compensation, denominated in dollars, as shown below.
714603_18_ITEM11_P88_S0	_______________________________________________________________________ (1) The perquisites and personal benefits in the last row of the above table are comprised of the following:
714603_18_ITEM11_P89_S0	* Mr. Hooley was allowed personal use of the aircraft, as explained in Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
714603_18_ITEM11_P89_S1	The amount shown for his perquisites includes the incremental cost of aircraft personal use during 2017 of $89,425 (calculated based on the hourly charge for the flight, the fuel charge for the flight, and the ground transportation charge).
714603_18_ITEM11_P89_S2	We did not include in the incremental cost any portion of our monthly aircraft management fee, which we would have paid regardless of the personal use, or depreciation on the plane, which does not vary based on use.
714603_18_ITEM11_P89_S3	Mr. Hooley incurred taxable income as a result of the use, which was not grossed-up for taxes.
714603_18_ITEM11_P89_S4	The NEOs also participated in 2017 in a program in which the Company, through a donor-advised fund at a community charitable foundation, will match contributions by the NEOs to qualified not-for-profit organizations in an amount equal to two times the contribution, with a $30,000 maximum for the Chief Executive Officer under the director match program and a $20,000 maximum for the other NEOs.
714603_18_ITEM11_P89_S5	Contributions were made on behalf of all associates who chose to participate, and we do not believe the contribution directly or indirectly benefited the NEO personally.
714603_18_ITEM11_P89_S6	Matching amounts from the foundation were: $30,000 for Mr. Hooley; $20,000 for Mr. Givens; $20,000 for Mr. Boehm; and $16,384 for Mr. Lark.

714603_18_ITEM11_P92_S4	Mr. Boehm elected to receive his account balance for the 2013 performance year in a lump sum upon retirement rather than on the vesting date.
714603_18_ITEM11_P93_S0	Arrangements for Incentive and Equity Awards.
714603_18_ITEM11_P94_S0	For performance years prior to 2014, we mandated deferral of a portion of each year s annual incentive award.
714603_18_ITEM11_P94_S1	Earnings and losses are credited or debited at least annually.
714603_18_ITEM11_P94_S2	Prior to 2014, NEOs could, by making an election by June 30 of the performance year, extend the future payout of vested deferred cash awards.
714603_18_ITEM11_P94_S3	The elected periods could either be a number of years or until separation from service.
714603_18_ITEM11_P94_S4	Beginning with awards for 2014 compensation, we discontinued deferral elections.
714603_18_ITEM11_P95_S0	Currently, Mr. Boehm is the only NEO who made a deferral election.
714603_18_ITEM11_P95_S1	Upon retirement, he will receive his balance in a lump sum.
714603_18_ITEM11_P96_S0	Grants of Plan Based Equity Awards For 2017 The following table and notes show annual incentive opportunity levels that existed at the beginning of 2017 for, and equity grants during 2017 to, each of the NEOs:
714603_18_ITEM11_P97_S0	_______________________________________________________________________ (1) The range of annual incentive awards that could have been earned for 2017 performance depended on the level of achievement of performance goals.
714603_18_ITEM11_P97_S1	The amounts shown represent percentages of base salary that were each NEOs threshold, target, and maximum opportunity levels, except that amounts shown for Mr. Burke, for whom no threshold or maximum performance levels were applicable, is the actual amount earned, as further described in Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Annual Cash Incentive.
714603_18_ITEM11_P98_S0	Goal achievement for 2017 has already been determined.
714603_18_ITEM11_P98_S1	The NEOs actual earned annual incentive awards for 2017 are shown in Compensation Discussion and Analysis-Annual Cash Incentive.
714603_18_ITEM11_P99_S0	(2) The target number is the number of PSUs granted in 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P99_S1	They have the potential to vest at a percentage of target based on the achievement of target, threshold, and maximum Adjusted EBITDA goals, as further described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis-Long-Term Equity Incentives-PSUs and Time-Based RSUs.

714603_18_ITEM11_P99_S4	(4) The allocation of the aggregate grant date fair value between the number of Time-Based RSUs and the number of PSUs (at the target grant level) is explained in Compensation Discussion and Analysis-Long-Term Equity Incentives-PSUs and Time-Based RSUs-Performance Stock Units.
714603_18_ITEM11_P100_S0	Vesting terms and conditions for these awards are described under Termination Payments and Potential Termination Payments.
714603_18_ITEM11_P101_S0	When the Company pays a dividend, equivalents accrue on unvested PSUs and Time-Based RSUs in the form of additional unvested units.
714603_18_ITEM11_P101_S1	During 2017, additional units received as dividend equivalents were as follows:
714603_18_ITEM11_P102_S0	The dividend equivalents for PSUs are shown at target level of performance, if performance is achieved after the three-year performance period.
714603_18_ITEM11_P103_S0	These columns show the gross number of units vesting, including dividend equivalents.
714603_18_ITEM11_P103_S1	Shares were withheld from this gross amount for satisfaction of tax withholding obligations.
714603_18_ITEM11_P104_S0	(1) The value realized on exercise of an award is calculated based on the difference between the per share closing market price for our common stock and the exercise price on the date of exercise multiplied by the number of options exercised, and the value realized on vesting of an award is calculated based on the per share closing market price for our common stock on the vesting date of the award multiplied by the number of shares vested.

714603_18_ITEM11_P107_S0	The Time-Based RSUs granted in 2015, 2016, and 2017 vest annually in one third increments.
714603_18_ITEM11_P107_S1	The unvested Time-Based RSUs are subject to forfeiture for termination of employment prior to vesting except for the special vesting events described under Termination Payments and Potential Termination Payments.

714603_18_ITEM11_P108_S0	Termination Payments and Potential Termination Payments On January 11, 2018, we entered into a Merger Agreement wherein SS C will acquire DST.
714603_18_ITEM11_P108_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, SS C will purchase DST in an all-cash transaction for $84.00 per share plus the assumption of debt, equating to an enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion.
714603_18_ITEM11_P108_S2	The transaction is subject to DST stockholder approval, clearances by the relevant regulatory authorities and other customary closing conditions.
714603_18_ITEM11_P108_S3	See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Description of the Business for more information regarding this transaction.
714603_18_ITEM11_P108_S4	The effects of the Merger on the Company s executive compensation plans and agreements are described in the definitive proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on February 27, 2018 in connection with the Merger.
714603_18_ITEM11_P109_S0	The Compensation Committee has incorporated accelerated vesting terms and conditions into its awards for certain termination of employment events.
714603_18_ITEM11_P109_S1	In the following table, we show the vesting and payout valuations for hypothetical terminations of employment as if they had occurred at December 31, 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P109_S2	Shown in the table are termination events* other than the following:
714603_18_ITEM11_P110_S0	a termination for cause * each event as defined in the applicable award agreement or plan These two types of terminations would not have caused accelerated award vesting or separation benefits.
714603_18_ITEM11_P111_S0	Following the table, we give details regarding the valuations as well as the reasons for termination benefits.
714603_18_ITEM11_P112_S0	Notes Regarding Effect of Various Events: A. Death or Disability: Time-Based RSUs granted in 2015 and 2016 would have accelerated.
714603_18_ITEM11_P112_S1	The performance period for the PSUs granted in 2015 expired on December 31, 2017.

714603_18_ITEM11_P113_S0	Prorated annual incentive awards for the year of the death or disability are to be paid at a target level of performance (which by year-end was already earned by the NEOs and therefore is not shown in the table).

714603_18_ITEM11_P124_S1	Mr. Hooley is also entitled to a prorated annual incentive award for the year of termination at the actual level of performance (which by year end was already earned and therefore not shown in the table as an additional benefit).
714603_18_ITEM11_P125_S0	For purposes of this table, we calculated health insurance premiums using current COBRA continuation rates and life insurance premiums using current rates.
714603_18_ITEM11_P126_S0	The agreement entitles Mr. Hooley to premium gross-ups as described in note (G).
714603_18_ITEM11_P126_S1	G. Employment Agreement Health and Life Insurance Premium Gross-Ups: The estimate for Mr. Hooley is based on our monthly cost of health, disability, and life insurance premiums as explained in note (F).
714603_18_ITEM11_P127_S0	monthly health, disability, and life insurance premiums by the number of months of taxable insurance coverage continuation to which the executive is entitled under his employment agreement.
714603_18_ITEM11_P127_S1	We then calculated the additional tax gross-up payment we would have been obligated to make in order to put the executive in an after-tax position as if he had never received the taxable insurance coverage continuation.
714603_18_ITEM11_P128_S0	H. Employment Agreement Change in Control Separation Provisions; Parachute Taxes: Under Mr. Hooley s employment agreement, the following benefits are provided upon a termination without cause or resignation for good reason that occurs within the three year period following the change in control, which we refer to as the Three-Year Period.
714603_18_ITEM11_P128_S1	For purposes of this table, December 31, 2017 is treated as both the date of termination and the change in control.
714603_18_ITEM11_P129_S0	Benefits : The employment agreement contemplates continued employment during the Three-Year Period and continued participation in DST's benefit plans, which we refer to as the Specified Benefits, on the basis of Mr. Hooley's participation on the date of the change in control; or, in the alternative, other plans which are at least equivalent to those in effect on the change in control.
714603_18_ITEM11_P130_S0	Termination following Change in Control :
714603_18_ITEM11_P130_S1	Under his employment agreement, after a change in control, if Mr. Hooley s employment is terminated by DST without cause or if the executive resigns for Good Reason (as defined below), then Mr. Hooley is entitled to receive a lump sum payment (payable within five days following the termination date) equal to the salary he would have received for the remainder of the Three-Year Period (but in no event less than one year) and continued benefits for such length of time; provided that: (a) if any plan pursuant to which Specified Benefits are provided immediately prior to termination would not permit continued participation, then DST will pay a lump sum equal (within five days following the termination date) to the amount of Specified Benefits that Mr. Hooley would have received if he was fully vested and a continuing participant in such plan until the end of the severance period; (b) if Mr. Hooley obtains new employment following termination, then after any waiting period applicable to participation in any plan of the new employer, he will continue to be entitled to receive benefits only to the extent such benefits would exceed those available under comparable plans of the new employer; and (c) Mr. Hooley is entitled a lump sum equal to the aggregate amount of the annual incentives he would have received if target goals had been met for each year of the Three-Year Period (prorated for the final performance year if the Three-Year Period ends partially through a performance year).
714603_18_ITEM11_P131_S0	Certain 280G Gross-ups : Mr. Hooley s employment agreement provides for a payment of a gross-up relating to the parachute payment tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.
714603_18_ITEM11_P131_S1	For Mr. Hooley, the parachute payment is generally subject to a scaleback equal to the largest amount that can be paid without triggering the parachute tax.
714603_18_ITEM11_P131_S2	If the payment is scaled back, there would be no parachute tax and no gross-up payment.
714603_18_ITEM11_P131_S3	However, if Mr. Hooley would retain, after tax, more than 120% of the amount he would retain if the potential parachute payments were scaled back, the cap does not apply and he is entitled to a gross-up payment, not to exceed five times the parachute tax.
714603_18_ITEM11_P132_S0	Good Reason : Good Reason will exist if Mr. Hooley resigns after a change in control and following: (i) a material reduction in duties or in level of work responsibility or conditions; (ii) a material reduction in base salary; (iii) the material relocation of the executive offices of DST or its successor to a location outside the metropolitan area of Kansas City, Missouri or requiring Mr. Hooley to be based anywhere other than DST s executive office, except for required business travel to an extent substantially consistent with his obligations immediately prior to the change in control date; or (iv) a material breach by DST in providing the Specified Benefits during the Three-Year Period, except for removal of benefits that are immaterial or reduction in benefits by 10% or less in the aggregate.
714603_18_ITEM11_P132_S1	To terminate with good reason following a change in control, (i) Mr. Hooley must provide written notice to the secretary of DST within ninety (90) days after the initial occurrence of a good reason event describing in detail the event and stating that Mr. Hooley s employment will terminate upon a specified date in such notice (which may be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 90 days after the date such notice is provided), and (ii) DST does not remedy the event prior to the specified termination date in such notice.
714603_18_ITEM11_P133_S0	Restrictive Covenants : Mr. Hooley is bound under his employment agreement by restrictive covenants against competition and against solicitation of employees, customers and vendors during his employment and for a minimum of three years following termination of his employment (and also including any period following termination of employment during which any unvested equity continues to vest), as well as a standard confidentiality provision.
714603_18_ITEM11_P134_S0	Mr. Hooley has entered into a separation agreement, pursuant to which, upon the Effective Time of the Merger, Mr. Hooley's employment with DST will be terminated for "good reason" (pursuant to his employment agreement as described above).
714603_18_ITEM11_P134_S1	In satisfaction of all obligations of DST under his employment agreement (as described above), Mr. Hooley will receive the cash severance and benefits described above on the closing date.
714603_18_ITEM11_P134_S2	In addition, in lieu of conversion of any of Mr. Hooley's outstanding RSUs and PSUs into SS C equity awards, such awards shall be converted into cash (based upon a cash price of $84.00 per share) and paid in a cash lump sum on the closing date, provided, that to the extent that any such cash award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, the cash payment will be paid subject to any six month delay required by Section 409A.
714603_18_ITEM11_P135_S0	The above description of Mr. Hooley's separation agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the separation agreement set forth in Exhibit 10.34 to this Form 10-K.
714603_18_ITEM11_P136_S0	The effects of the Separation Agreement are not reflected in the table above.
714603_18_ITEM11_P137_S0	Lark participate in our ESP and receive benefits for qualifying terminations of employment, which are terminations for reasons other than death, disability, or by the Company for cause.
714603_18_ITEM11_P137_S1	Upon a qualifying termination, the NEOs will receive the following ESP benefits:
714603_18_ITEM11_P138_S0	Reimbursement for outplacement consulting fees of up to $25,000.
714603_18_ITEM11_P138_S1	J. Executive Severance Plan Change in Control Separation Provisions:
714603_18_ITEM11_P139_S0	The ESP also provides benefits for a qualifying termination of employment during a two year protection period that begins on the earlier of a potential change in control or actual change in control, each as addressed in the plan.
714603_18_ITEM11_P139_S1	The qualifying terminations include terminations for reasons other than death, disability, or by the Company for cause, as well as terminations by the NEOs for good reason.
714603_18_ITEM11_P139_S2	For purposes of this table, December 31, 2017 is treated as the date of both the qualifying termination and the change in control.
714603_18_ITEM11_P139_S3	Upon a qualifying termination, the NEO will receive:
714603_18_ITEM11_P140_S0	Reimbursement for outplacement consulting fees of up to $25,000.
714603_18_ITEM11_P140_S1	The ESP contains a best-net cutback provision such that if the payment of any of these amounts would subject the Company and the executive to the excise tax gross-up provisions of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the payments would be reduced to an amount below the threshold at which such penalty tax provisions apply if such a reduction (and the avoidance of such penalty taxes) would be more favorable to the executive on an after-tax basis.
714603_18_ITEM11_P140_S2	Messrs. Burke and Lark s estimated payments would be reduced so that he would not be subject to an excise tax.
714603_18_ITEM11_P141_S0	Valuation Methods for the Table Type of Incentive or Equity Award Valuation Method Time-Based RSUs The Time-Based RSUs valued in the table are described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
714603_18_ITEM11_P141_S1	The amount shown for Time-Based RSUs is the number of units that would vest multiplied by the December 31, 2017 closing price of $62.07 ( Closing Price ) and includes dividend equivalents through 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P141_S2	PSUs The PSUs valued in the table have a three year performance period and are further described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
714603_18_ITEM11_P141_S3	For purposes of this section, we used the actual goal achievement of the PSUs granted in 2015 (with a 2015-2017 performance period) of 0% and estimated PSUs granted in 2016 (with a 2016 2018 performance period) to be 124% of the target goal level, using the accounting assumptions described in the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K.
714603_18_ITEM11_P142_S0	The amount shown for PSUs is the number of units that would vest based on the estimated achievement, multiplied by the Closing Price.
714603_18_ITEM11_P142_S1	We have included in our calculations the PSUs granted as dividend equivalents through 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P143_S0	Actual goal achievement for PSUs may differ.
714603_18_ITEM11_P144_S0	On January 11, 2018, we entered into a Merger Agreement wherein SS C will acquire DST.
714603_18_ITEM11_P144_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, SS C will purchase DST in an all-cash transaction for $84.00 per share plus the assumption of debt, equating to an enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion.
714603_18_ITEM11_P144_S2	The transaction is subject to DST stockholder approval, clearances by the relevant regulatory authorities and other customary closing conditions.
714603_18_ITEM11_P144_S3	See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Description of Business for more information regarding this transaction.
714603_18_ITEM11_P144_S4	The effects of the Merger on the Company s equity awards and other executive compensation plans and agreements are described in greater detail in the definitive proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on February 27, 2018 in connection with the Merger, and any description of such effects of the Merger Agreement in this Form 10-K are qualified in their entirety by the definitive transaction documents, including the Merger Agreement set forth in Exhibit 2.8 to this Form 10-K as the same may be amended from time to time, and the associated definitive proxy statement to be filed with the SEC.

714603_18_ITEM11_P144_S6	Each vested option with an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger without payment of any consideration.
714603_18_ITEM11_P144_S7	Upon completion of the Merger, each unvested Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing will be converted automatically into an option to purchase the number of shares of SS C common stock ( Rollover Option ), equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of DST common stock subject to such unvested option immediately prior to the closing by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, which is the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the Merger Consideration by (b) the average, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth, of the closing-sale prices of SS C common stock on Nasdaq as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the ten full trading days ending on (and including) the trading day preceding the closing, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth, with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares.
714603_18_ITEM11_P144_S8	Each Rollover Option will have an exercise price per share of SS C common stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (1) the per share exercise price for the shares of DST common stock subject to such unvested Option divided by (2) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

Upon completion of the Merger, each unvested performance stock unit that is outstanding immediately prior to the closing will be converted automatically into a restricted stock unit with respect to a number of shares of SS C common stock ( Rollover PSU ), equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of DST common stock that would be delivered in respect of such unvested performance stock unit based on actual projected performance through to the effective date of the Merger (equal to 124% of target for performance stock units granted in 2016, and 200% of target for performance stock units granted in 2017) by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares.
714603_18_ITEM11_P145_S1	Each Rollover PSU will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the unvested performance stock unit under the applicable DST stock plan and award agreement, including time-vesting requirements, but excluding any performance-vesting requirements.
714603_18_ITEM11_P146_S0	Treatment of Restricted Stock Units Upon completion of the Merger, each vested restricted stock unit outstanding immediately prior to the closing will be canceled and the holder will be entitled to receive a cash payment payable as soon as practicable following the closing (but in any event no later than three (3) business days after the closing) equal to the product (x) the Merger Consideration and (y) the number of shares of DST common stock subject to the vested restricted stock unit (subject to any required tax withholding); provided, that to the extent that any such vested restricted stock unit constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, the cash payment will be paid in accordance with the applicable award s terms and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A. Upon completion of the Merger, each unvested restricted stock unit that is outstanding immediately prior to the closing (including restricted stock units that will comprise the annual equity awards to be granted by DST in February 2018) will be converted automatically into a restricted stock unit with respect to a number of shares of SS C common stock ( Rollover RSU ), equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of DST common stock subject to the unvested restricted stock unit immediately prior to the closing by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares.
714603_18_ITEM11_P146_S1	Each Rollover RSU will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the unvested restricted stock unit under the applicable DST stock plan and award agreement.
714603_18_ITEM11_P147_S0	Treatment of Cash Awards Each vested long-term cash award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing will be canceled at the closing and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a cash payment payable as soon as practicable following the closing (but in any event no later than three (3) business days after the closing) in the amount set forth in the applicable notice of grant and award agreement; provided, that to the extent that any such vested long-term cash award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, the cash payment will be paid in accordance with the applicable award s terms and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A.
714603_18_ITEM11_P147_S1	Each unvested long-term cash award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing will remain outstanding and subject to the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the closing.
714603_18_ITEM11_P148_S0	The Compensation Committee believes these limited termination of employment protections:
714603_18_ITEM11_P149_S0	provide stability in the event of a possible change in control.
714603_18_ITEM11_P149_S1	In consideration of these protections, NEOs accept award agreements in which they commit not to solicit Company employees and clients for one year after termination of employment.
714603_18_ITEM11_P150_S0	PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE Pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the total annual compensation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer to the median employee s annual total compensation.
714603_18_ITEM11_P150_S1	Set forth below for 2017 is a comparison of (i) the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (except the Chief Executive Officer of the Company) and (ii) the annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer.
714603_18_ITEM11_P150_S2	The median of the annual total compensation and the pay ratio described below are reasonable estimates calculated by the Company in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
714603_18_ITEM11_P150_S3	We estimate that the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (except our Chief Executive Officer), as adjusted to include the Company provided benefit contribution, was approximately $77,550 for 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P150_S4	The annual total compensation of Stephen C. Hooley, our Chief Executive Officer, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Item 11, was $7,452,490 for 2017, and we added the Company provided benefits contribution, available to all employees generally, to Mr. Hooleys compensation for a total of $7,471,342.
714603_18_ITEM11_P150_S5	The Company provided benefit contribution comprises a large percentage of our employee compensation package and has therefore been included in this Pay Ratio comparison for both our median employee and Mr. Hooley.
714603_18_ITEM11_P150_S6	Given that this is a broad-based benefit for employees, this value is generally not included as part of the Summary Compensation Table disclosure.
714603_18_ITEM11_P150_S7	Based on this information, we estimate that the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 96 to 1 for 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P151_S0	To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our Chief Executive Officer, we used the following methodology and made the following material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates: 1.
714603_18_ITEM11_P151_S1	We determined that, as of October 1, 2017, the employee population of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries consisted of approximately 14,400 individuals, with approximately 7,700 U.S. employees and approximately 6,700 non-U.S. employees.
714603_18_ITEM11_P151_S2	We adjusted the employee population used for purposes of determining the median employee to approximately 7,900 individuals as permitted by the SEC rules, as follows: a.
714603_18_ITEM11_P151_S3	We excluded all of the employees on such date in the following countries, constituting in the aggregate less than 5% of the total number of employees, as follows: (i) approximately 244 employees in Australia, (ii) approximately 13 employees in Canada, (iii) approximately 1 employee in China, (iv) approximately 12 employees in Hong Kong and (v) approximately 2 employees in South Africa.
714603_18_ITEM11_P151_S4	We excluded all of the employees of BFDS and IFDS U.K. who became employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interests in those entities in 2017, as follows: (i) approximately 2,000 employees of BFDS, and (ii) approximately 4,200 employees of IFDS U.K. 3.
714603_18_ITEM11_P152_S0	To identify the median employee from the adjusted employee population, we compared the amount of salary and wages of such employees for the full twelve months of 2017.
714603_18_ITEM11_P152_S1	We annualized the compensation of employees hired during the measurement period and active employees who left the Company after October 1 to reflect compensation for the entire measurement period.
714603_18_ITEM11_P152_S2	We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the median employee.
714603_18_ITEM11_P152_S3	We only utilized the corporate foreign currency exchange rates to convert all international compensation data to the U.S. dollar for purposes of comparison.
714603_18_ITEM11_P152_S4	Once we identified our median employee, we included the elements of such employee s compensation for 2017 determined in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, together with the Company provided benefit contribution value.
714603_18_ITEM11_P152_S5	With respect to the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, we added the Company provided benefit contribution value to the amount reported in the Total column of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table included in this Item 11, which was calculated in accordance with the same requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.
714603_18_ITEM11_P153_S0	The Committee reviews non-employee director compensation annually.
714603_18_ITEM11_P153_S1	This review includes an analysis by Deloitte of peer company director compensation and other public company director compensation practices and trends.
714603_18_ITEM11_P153_S2	After such review, the Committee recommends components of non employee director compensation to the Board.
714603_18_ITEM11_P154_S0	The Board is responsible for and has the authority to determine the components of non employee director compensation.
714603_18_ITEM11_P155_S0	_______________________________________________________________________ (1) Board and Committee meeting fees were eliminated (unless the number of Board or Committee meetings exceeds seven in a one-year measurement period, in which case a per-meeting fee of $2,000 would be paid for excess meeting fees).
714603_18_ITEM11_P155_S1	(2) Grants of DST stock were made pursuant to the 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan and were paid as soon as practicable following the date of the annual meeting to continuing directors.
714603_18_ITEM11_P155_S2	The number of shares was based on the fair market value (as determined under rules of the Compensation Committee) on the date of grant.
714603_18_ITEM11_P156_S0	Directors Deferred Fee Plan - Deferred DST Shares Only In 2015, the Board adopted a voluntary Directors Deferred Fee Plan (the Directors Deferred Fee Plan ) that permits electing directors to receive deferred shares of DST common stock in lieu of: (i) cash directors fees and (ii) stock directors fees.
714603_18_ITEM11_P156_S1	The payment of the deferred shares received under the Directors Deferred Fee Plan are deferred for tax purposes until a director s service from the Board ends.
714603_18_ITEM11_P156_S2	Before any deferred shares are delivered to a participating director, the director does not have any right to vote any of his or her deferred shares nor to receive any cash dividends on the deferred shares to the extent dividends are payable on shares of DST common stock.
714603_18_ITEM11_P156_S3	If and when DST pays a cash dividend on its shares, additional deferred shares are credited to a participating director s account.
714603_18_ITEM11_P156_S4	The additional shares credited have a value equal to the dividends that otherwise would have been payable to a plan account if the hypothetical shares then credited were actual shares of DST common stock.
714603_18_ITEM11_P156_S5	All credited whole deferred shares will be settled in actual shares of DST common stock and such shares will be issued to a director upon the director s termination from Board service.
714603_18_ITEM11_P156_S6	Any fractional deferred share will be rounded up to a whole share.
714603_18_ITEM11_P157_S0	Most directors were initially eligible to participate in the Directors Deferred Fee Plan as of May 2015, and the plan applies only to eligible director compensation earned after that date.
714603_18_ITEM11_P157_S1	Other Perquisites We purchase term life insurance for non-employee directors.
714603_18_ITEM11_P157_S2	The directors name the policy beneficiaries.
714603_18_ITEM11_P157_S3	We provide spousal travel to and from occasional off-site planning meetings and reimburse family entertainment at such meetings.
714603_18_ITEM11_P157_S4	If we do not incur an incremental cost for an additional passenger, the spouse or significant other of a director may accompany the director for travel associated with meetings of the Board or its committees by traveling on aircraft in which we have an interest.
714603_18_ITEM11_P158_S0	_______________________________________________________________________ (1) All non-employee directors with continuing service after the 2017 Annual Meeting received shares of DST stock as of the date of the 2017 Annual Meeting.
714603_18_ITEM11_P158_S1	The number of shares granted was determined by using $62.50 (post split number), the average of the highest and lowest reported sale price of DST stock on May 9, 2017, the date of the 2017 Annual Meeting.
714603_18_ITEM11_P158_S2	The amount reflected in the column reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of this grant.
714603_18_ITEM11_P159_S0	Messrs. Antonellis, Forsee, and Haldeman and Ms. Bleil deferred their shares under the Directors Deferred Fee Plan and elected to receive any compensation that would be paid in cash in stock.
714603_18_ITEM11_P159_S1	Messrs. Antonellis, Bailey, Bryan, Forsee, and Haldeman and Ms. Bleil received cash compensation for additional meeting fees.
714603_18_ITEM11_P159_S2	(2) For all directors, amounts include term life insurance premiums.
714603_18_ITEM11_P160_S0	Directors may participate in our charitable match program.
714603_18_ITEM11_P160_S1	Under the program, the Company, through a donor-advised fund at a community charitable foundation, will match contributions by the director to qualified not-for-profit organizations in an annual amount equal to three times the contribution but not to exceed $30,000.
714603_18_ITEM11_P160_S2	Matching amounts from the foundation were: $30,000 for Mr. Antonellis, $30,000 for Ms.Bleil, $30,000 for Mr. Bryan, $30,000 for Mr. Forsee, $30,000 for Mr. Haldeman, and $30,000 for Mr. Liss.
714603_18_ITEM11_P160_S3	We have not included matching amounts in compensation as we do not believe the contribution directly or indirectly affects the director personally.
