1409999_11_ITEM14_P0_S0	John Kinross-Kennedy, C.P.A,. audited the Company's financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1409999_11_ITEM14_P0_S1	The following table shows the aggregate fees billed to the Company during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by Mr. Kinross-Kennedy.
1409999_11_ITEM14_P1_S0	Audit fees and audit related fees represent amounts billed for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements and the review of the Company's interim financial statements.
1409999_11_ITEM14_P1_S1	Before Mr. Kinross-Kennedy was engaged by the Company to render these services, the engagement was approved by the Company's Directors.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P0_S0	To: The Board of Directors and Shareholders Digital Development Partners Inc.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P1_S0	I have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Digital Development Partners Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of operations, and of cash flows for the years ended 2010 and 2009 and the period from inception, (December 22, 2006), to December 31, 2010.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P1_S2	My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P2_S0	I conducted my audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1409999_11_ITEM15_P2_S1	Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P3_S2	I believe that my audit provide a reasonable basis for my opinion.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P4_S0	In my opinion, based on my audit, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Digital Development Partners Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the results of its operations, and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the period from inception (December 22, 2006) to December 31, 2010 in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P5_S0	The Company has determined that it is not required to have, nor was I engaged to perform, an audit of the effectiveness of its documented internal controls over financial reporting.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P6_S0	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P6_S1	Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P7_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P7_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P8_S0	The financial statements have, in management's opinion, been properly prepared within the reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized in Note 2.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P9_S0	The Company was incorporated as Cyprium Resources, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada December 22, 2006.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P9_S1	The company was originally formed for mineral exploration in the United States.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P9_S2	On May 19, 2009 the name was changed to Digital Development Partners, Inc.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	In January, 2007 the Company entered into a 20 year lease agreement with the owner of 10 mining claims situated in Utah, known as the King claims.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P10_S1	The lease was maintained current through September 30, 2008, however mining activities were limited.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P10_S2	The lease was terminated by mutual agreement in November 2008.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P11_S0	On August 3, 2009 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of 4gDeals Inc., a private Nevada corporation, through the issue of 15,495,000 shares of the Company's common stock.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	4gDeals Inc. changed its name in 2009 to Yu Deal Inc.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	YuDeal is a development stage company soliciting merchants for contracts for the use of its web based system for issuing coupons to customers on-line.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	On November 11, 2009 the Company purchased an option to buy all the membership interests in Top Floor Studio Inc., a private Pennsylvania Limited Liability Corporation, through the issue of 100,000 shares of Company stock to the principal of Top Floor Studio.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P13_S1	Top Floor Studio, a web design company, began working with YuDeal, Inc. on web marketing of YuDeal's product.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	On February 17, 2010 the Company adopted a reorganization plan which included:
1409999_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	Acquisition of a new line of technology through the acquisition of the worldwide distribution and servicing rights to a cell phone enterprise based in Hong Kong; 2.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P15_S1	Sale of the Company's option on Top Floor Studio; 4.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P15_S2	Distribution of the Company's shares in YuDeal, Inc. to the stockholders.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	Accordingly on February 17, 2010 an agreement was signed with the cell phone company, EFT Bioteck Holding, Inc., which trades on the OTC Pink Sheets under the ticker symbol "EFTB", and markets its "EFT-Phone" through direct marketing in China including Hong Kong.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P16_S1	Its distribution and servicing rights were acquired by the Company in the agreement through the exchange of 79,265,000 shares of the Company's common stock.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	Coincidentally the management team of the Company resigned.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P17_S1	The Company's president, Isaac Roberts, was replaced by Jack Jie Quin, president of EFT Biotech Holding Inc.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	Pursuant to the plan, in February, 2010 the option on Top Floor Studio was exchanged with YuDeal, Inc. for 2,480,066 shares of YuDeal common stock.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	On February 22, 2010, pursuant to the plan, 2,009,501 shares of YuDeal common stock held by the Company following the exchange with YuDeal Inc., were in turn exchanged for Company stock owned by four stockholders of the company.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P19_S1	These included the former president and Secretary of the Company and the Chief Operating Officer of Top Floor Studio, Inc.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P19_S2	The exchange was on a 10 for 1 basis: one YuDeal share for ten Company shares.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P19_S3	This resulted in 20,095,000 Company shares being returned to Treasury, which were then cancelled.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	Following these transactions, the Company held a residual of 670,565 shares of YuDeal Inc.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P20_S1	As required by the plan of reorganization, these shares were distributed to Company stockholders in March and April of 2010 on the basis of one share of YuDeal, Inc. for every ten shares of Company stock held.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P21_S1	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P21_S2	Significant estimates made by management are, among others, realizability of long-lived assets and deferred taxes.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10, (formerly SFAS No. 157), "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" for financial assets and liabilities.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	FASB ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	FASB ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P24_S2	The carrying amounts of the Company's financial assets and liabilities as at December 31, 2010 were measured against the three levels of inputs required by the standard to measure fair value:
1409999_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company utilizes ASC 740, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P25_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P25_S2	Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P25_S3	The Company generated a deferred tax credit through net operating loss carryforward.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P25_S4	However, a valuation allowance of 100% has been established, as the realization of the deferred tax credits is not reasonably certain, based on going concern considerations outlined under "Going Concern" following.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	This Standard codified in ASC 105 is being modified to include the authoritative and non-authoritative levels of GAAP.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	This amendment is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P26_S2	ASU No. 2010-01 has no effect on the Company's financial position, statements of operations, or cash flows at this time.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	to Section 12(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the appropriate agency under that Section, (3) not be bound to disclosing the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated, (4) note the definition of public entity is not longer defined nor necessary for Topic 855, (5) note the scope of the reissuance disclosure requirements is refined to include revised financial statements only.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	These Updates are effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2010.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P27_S2	ASU No. 2010-09 has no effect on the Company's financial position, statements of operations, or cash flows at this time.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	In March 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-11, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Scope Exception Related to Embedded Credit Derivatives" (codified within ASC 815 - Derivatives and Hedging).
1409999_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	ASU 2010-11 improves disclosures originally required under SFAS No. 161.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P28_S2	ASU 2010-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after June 15, 2010.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P28_S3	The adoption of this statement had no effect on the Company's reported financial position or results of operations.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, "Revenue recognition - Milestone Method (Topic 605): Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition" (codified within ASC 605 - Revenue Recognition).
1409999_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	ASU 2010-17 provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P29_S2	ASU 2010-17 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after June 15, 2010.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P29_S3	The adoption of this statement had no effect on the Company's reported financial position or results of operations.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	In May 2010, the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) issued Accounting Standards Update 2010-19 (ASU 2010-19), Foreign Currency (Topic 830): Foreign Currency Issues: Multiple Foreign Currency Exchange Rates.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P30_S1	The amendments in this Update are effective as of the announcement date of March 18, 2010.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P30_S2	The Company does not expect the provisions of ASU 2010-19 to have any effect on the Company's reported financial position or results of operations.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company was in the development stage prior to its year ended December 31, 2010.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	During fiscal 2010 principal operations began and the Company began to earn significant revenue.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P31_S2	Accordingly, the Company was no longer in the development stage during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, for the period presented.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P32_S1	Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P32_S2	Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilative convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P32_S3	Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P32_S4	Under this method, options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	As of December 31, 2010 the Company has potentially dilutive securities in outstanding warrants for the purchase of 2,666,330,000 shares of common stock.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	Since the Company is in a loss position the warrants are anti-dilutive and not considered in the calculation.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1409999_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	A deposit was made for the manufacture of EFT smart phones following purchase of distribution and servicing rights from EFT Bioteck Holding, Inc. in February, 2010.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	The EFT Project was recorded as the cost of acquisition of a new line of technology through the acquisition in February, 2010 of the worldwide distribution and servicing rights for the "EFT Smart Phone".
1409999_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	This was purchased from EFT Bioteck Holding, Inc, a cell phone enterprise operating in China, including Hong Kong, by the exchange of stock.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	The project was analyzed at year end for impairment related to future cash flows.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P37_S1	It was found that current projections for sales will not cover operating costs in the foreseeable future.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P37_S2	The project was therefore considered 100% impaired and written down accordingly.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	A promissory note was issued May 13, 2010 for $500,000 for cash received from to EFT Biotech Holdings Inc., a California corporation located in City of Industry, California.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	A series of additional advances from EFT Biotech followed from June to November, 2010, raising the total to $619,666.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P38_S2	The note bears annual interest of 5%, requires no monthly payments, and matured November 13, 2010.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P38_S3	The final advance in the series of $10,000 was made after maturity on November 29, 2010.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	No provision was made for federal income tax, since the Company had an operating loss and has accumulated net operating loss carryforwards.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	The net operating loss carryforwards may be used to reduce taxable income through the year 2025.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	On January 5, 2010 the Company issued 100,000 shares of common stock to the principal of Top Floor Studio Inc. in payment for the option to buy all the membership interests of that company, pursuant to an agreement signed November 11, 2009.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	On February 2, 2010 the Company issued 114,665 shares of common stock for services, at $0.10 per share, representing the market price of the stock.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	An expense of $11,467 was recorded.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P41_S2	The shares were accompanied by an equal number of Series A and Series B warrants.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P41_S3	The Series A warrants entitle the holder to purchase one share of the Corporations common stock at a price of $1.00 per share at any time on or before September 30, 2014.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P41_S4	The Series B warrants are similar, the strike price being $1.25.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	On February 18, 2010 the Company issued 79,265,000 shares of common stock to EFT Biotech Holdings, Inc. pursuant to an agreement to purchase the worldwide distribution and servicing rights of the EFT-Phone system.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	On February 22, 2010, 20,095,000 shares of Company stock were returned to Treasury and cancelled, pursuant to an agreement to exchange the stock for 2,009,501 shares of subsidiary YuDeal, Inc.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	In June, 2010, 432,000 shares of Company stock were recorded as issued pursuant to completion of the September 2009 offering.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	As at December 31, 2010, the Company was authorized to issue 225,000,000 common shares, of which 86,402,665 were issued and outstanding.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	There were no legal proceedings against the Company with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	Neither the Company nor any of its officers or directors is involved in any other litigation or is involved either as plaintiffs or defendants, and have no knowledge of any threatened or pending litigation against them or any of the officers or directors.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	Events subsequent to December 31, 2010 have been evaluated through March 30, 2010, the date these statements were available to be issued, to determine whether they should be disclosed.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	Management found no subsequent events to be disclosed.
1409999_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	In accordance with Section 13 or 15(a) of the Exchange Act, the Registrant has caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized on the 31st day of March 2011.

1409999_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Digital Development Partners, Inc. (the "Company") on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2010 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Report"), Jack Jie Qin, the Principal Executive Officer, and William E. Sluss, the Principal Financial Officer of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to the best of their knowledge:
1409999_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects the financial condition and results of the Company.
1409999_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	The Company was incorporated in December 2006.
1409999_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	During the period from its incorporation through March 15, 2010 the Company has not generated any revenue.
1409999_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	In January 2007 the Company leased ten mining claims from an unrelated third party.
1409999_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	These claims were located in Piute County, Utah.
1409999_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	The mining lease was for a twenty-year term and required the Company to pay a royalty to the lessor equal to 2.5% of the net smelter returns from the sale of any minerals extracted from the claims.
1409999_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	Minimum royalty payments of $4,500 were also required each year during the term of the lease.
1409999_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	On November 1, 2008 the mining lease was terminated by the mutual agreement of the Company and the lessor.
1409999_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Between November 2008 and March 2009 the Company did not conduct any business.
1409999_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	On January 15, 2009 Jeffrey A. Collins purchased 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock from Consultants Risk Management, Inc.
1409999_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	At that time, the 1,500,000 shares purchased by Mr. Collins represented approximately 42% of the Company s common stock and Consultants Risk Management, Inc. was controlled by the Company s sole officer and director, Richard Shea.

1409999_12_ITEM15_P1_S1	Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

1409999_12_ITEM15_P4_S0	The Company has determined that it is not required to have, nor was I engaged to perform, an audit of the effectiveness of its documented internal controls over financial reporting.

1409999_12_ITEM15_P7_S1	4gDeals Inc. changed its name in 2009 to Yu Deal Inc.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P8_S0	YuDeal was a development stage company soliciting merchants for contracts for the use of its web based system for issuing coupons to customers on-line.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	On November 11, 2009 the Company purchased an option to buy all the membership interests in Top Floor Studios, LLC, a private Pennsylvania limited liability company, through the issue of 100,000 shares of Company stock to the principal of Top Floor Studios.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P9_S1	Top Floor Studios, was a web design company, that was working with YuDeal, Inc. on web marketing YuDeal s product.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P10_S0	On February 17, 2010 the Company adopted a reorganization plan which included:

1409999_12_ITEM15_P12_S0	Accordingly on February 17, 2010 an agreement was signed with the cell phone company, EFT Holdings, Inc., which trades on the OTC Pink Sheets under the ticker symbol EFTB , and marketed its EFT-Phone through direct marketing in China including Hong Kong.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P12_S1	Its distribution and servicing rights were acquired by the Company in the agreement through the exchange of 79,265,000 shares of the Company s common stock.

1409999_12_ITEM15_P15_S2	The exchange was on a 10 for 1 basis: one YuDeal share for ten Company shares.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P15_S3	This resulted in 20,095,000 Company shares being returned to Treasury, which were then cancelled.

1409999_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P17_S1	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P17_S2	Significant estimates made by management are, among others, realizability of long-lived assets and deferred taxes.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10, (formerly SFAS No. 157), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" for financial assets and liabilities.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P19_S1	FASB ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P20_S1	FASB ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P20_S2	The carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities as at December 31, 2010 were measured against the three levels of inputs required by the standard to measure fair value:
1409999_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company utilizes FASB ACS 740, Income Taxes , which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P21_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	The Company generated a deferred tax credit through net operating loss carry-forward.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P23_S2	However, a valuation allowance of 100% has been established, as management believes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax credits will not be realized, based on going concern considerations outlined below.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	Interest and penalties on tax deficiencies recognized in accordance with ACS accounting standards are classified as income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740-10-50-19.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	The amendments in this update generally represent clarifications of Topic 820, but also include some instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P25_S1	This update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P25_S2	The amendments in this update are to be applied prospectively.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P25_S3	The amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P25_S4	The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	This update defers only those changes in update 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P26_S1	All other requirements in update 2011-05 are not affected by this update, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	ASU No. 2011-05 and 2011-12 are effective for fiscal years (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2011.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	The amendments in this update require enhanced disclosures around financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset in accordance with either ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45 or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.

1409999_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	A variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various regulatory agencies.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	Due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, the Company s management has not determined whether implementation of such standards would be material to its financial statements.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Company emerged from the development stage, having developed a steady source of revenue in accordance with their business plan.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, for the period presented.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilative convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P31_S3	Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P31_S4	Under this method, options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	As of December 31, 2011 the Company has potentially dilutive securities in outstanding warrants for the purchase of 2,666,330,000 shares of common stock.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	Since the Company is in a loss position the warrants are anti-dilutive and not considered in the calculation.
1409999_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:

1409999_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	A promissory note was issued May 13, 2010 for $500,000 for cash received from to EFT Holdings Inc., a California corporation located in City of Industry, California.

1409999_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	An increase in valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2011 was recorded, $3,500, because in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

1409999_13_ITEM15_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

1409999_13_ITEM15_P4_S1	As shown in the financial statements, the Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $7,954,373 from inception to December 31, 2012.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P4_S2	This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

1409999_13_ITEM15_P9_S0	The Company has determined that it is not required to have, nor was I engaged to perform, an audit of the effectiveness of its documented internal controls over financial reporting.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P10_S0	These financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to fairly state the Company s financial position and the results of its operations for the periods presented, in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P10_S1	All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	The Company was incorporated as Cyprium Resources, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada December 22, 2006.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P11_S1	The Company was originally formed for mineral exploration in the United States.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P11_S2	On May 19, 2009 the Company s name was changed to Digital Development Partners, Inc.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P12_S0	A reassessment of the Company s direction resulted in a reorganization plan on February 17, 2010 which included:
1409999_13_ITEM15_P13_S0	Distribution of the Company s shares in YuDeal, Inc. to the stockholders.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	Pursuant to the plan, the Company s interests in Top Floor Studio and YuDeal Inc. were disposed of in February, 2010.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P14_S1	The Company s option on Top Floor was sold to YuDeal, Inc. for YuDeal common stock, which in turn was traded for 20,095,000 shares of Company stock.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P14_S2	These shares were returned to Treasury and cancelled.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P14_S3	A residual of YuDeal stock was distributed to Company stockholders in March and April, 2010.

1409999_13_ITEM15_P15_S1	The Company s president, Isaac Roberts, was replaced by Jack Jie Quin, president of EFT Biotech Holding Inc.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	On February 17, 2010 an agreement was signed with the cell phone company, EFT Biotech Holding, Inc., which trades on the OTC Pink Sheets under the ticker symbol EFTB , and markets its EFT-Phone through direct marketing in China from Hong Kong.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P16_S1	EFT s distribution and servicing rights were acquired by the Company in the agreement through the exchange of 79,265,000 shares of the Company s common stock.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	EFT Biotech Holding Inc. thereby became the majority stockholder of Digital Development Partners Inc.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P17_S1	The Company sold EFT-Phones as agent to EFT-Phone for its Chinese market through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P17_S2	There have been no new orders in the current fiscal year.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P17_S3	EFT has advised the Company that due to a significant drop in demand for the EFT phone, no new orders will be placed until demand increases.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P17_S4	The Company is investigating other business opportunities and sources to develop revenue.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P18_S1	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P19_S1	The Company had no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC 820-10 (SFAS No. 157), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures " for financial assets and liabilities.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P20_S1	ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P21_S1	FASB ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P21_S2	The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:
1409999_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	The Company calculates a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P24_S2	In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment and interpretation of statutes is required.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P24_S3	Additionally, the Company uses tax planning strategies as a part of its tax compliance program.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P24_S4	Judgments and interpretation of statutes are inherent in this process.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	The accounting guidance for uncertainties in income tax prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P25_S1	The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits and a consideration of the relevant taxing authority s widely understood administrative practices and precedents.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	We believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to ASC 740.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P26_S2	In addition, we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASC 740.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P26_S3	our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with income-based tax audits is to record such items as a component of income taxes.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company s activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital beyond 2012.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	Additionally, the Company s capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of the Company s researching for new markets.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P27_S2	The Company plans to continue financing its operations with cash received from financing activities, more specifically from related party loans.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	While the Company strongly believes that its capital resources will be sufficient in the near term, there is no assurance that the Company s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Effective January 2012, FASB adopted ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011-04).
1409999_13_ITEM15_P29_S1	ASU 2011-04 represents the converged guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) on fair value measurement.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P29_S2	A variety of measures are included in the update intended to either clarify existing fair value measurement requirements, change particular principles requirements for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	For many of the requirements, the FASB does not intend to change the application of existing requirements under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	ASU 2011-04 was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the financial statements .
1409999_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	January 2012, FASB adopted ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011-05).
1409999_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	ASU 2011-05 is intended to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of accounting guidance in this area with that of the IASB.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	The amendments require that all nonowner changes in shareholders equity be presented in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 (ASU 2011-12).
1409999_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	ASU 2011-12 defers the provisions of ASU 2011-05 that require the presentation of reclassification adjustments on the face of both the statement of income and statement of other comprehensive income.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P34_S2	Amendments under ASU 2011-05 that were not deferred under ASU 2011-12 will be applied retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P34_S3	The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the financial statements .
1409999_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (ASU 2011-11).
1409999_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	The amendments in ASU 2011-11 require the disclosure of information on offsetting and related arrangements for financial and derivative instruments to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P35_S2	Amendments under ASU 2011-11 will be applied retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after January 1, 2013.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P35_S3	The Company is evaluating the effect, if any, adoption of ASU 2011-11 will have on its financial statements.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive (ASU 2013-02).
1409999_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	This guidance is the culmination of the FASB s deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).
1409999_13_ITEM15_P36_S2	The amendments in ASU 2013-02 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P36_S3	However, the amendments require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of AOCI in its entirety, by component, on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P36_S4	Amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income must be cross-referenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P36_S5	This standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P36_S6	The Company is evaluating the effect, if any; the adoption of ASU 2013-02 will have on its financial statements.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share, for the period presented.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P38_S1	Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P38_S2	Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P38_S3	Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P38_S4	Under this method, options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	As of December 31, 2012 the Company has potentially dilutive securities in outstanding warrants for the purchase of 85,970,665 shares of common stock.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	Since the Company is in a loss position the warrants are anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:
1409999_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	A promissory note for $500,000 was issued May 13, 2010 to EFT Holdings Inc.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	A series of advances was received from EFT Holdings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 totaling $300,000.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P41_S2	The note bears annual interest of 5%, requires no monthly payments, and matured November 13, 2010.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P41_S3	The note was extended indefinitely due on demand.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P41_S4	The note was paid down to $300,000 in January, 2011.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P41_S5	A further $20,000 was advanced August 17, 2012, and another $20,000 was advanced on December 11, 2012 increasing the loan balance to 340,000.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	No provision was made for federal income tax for the year ended December 31, 2012, since the Company had net operating losses.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	The Company has available a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $8,519,259, which begins to expire in 2029 unless utilized beforehand.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	Net operating loss carry forwards may be used to reduce taxable income through the year 2032.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P43_S2	The availability of the Company s net operating loss carry forwards are subject to limitation if there is a 50% or more positive change in the ownership of the Company s stock.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P43_S3	As presented below, the Company generated a deferred tax asset through the net operating loss carry-forward.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P43_S4	However, a 100% valuation allowance has been established because the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss carryforwards are available.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P43_S5	Management considers projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and available tax planning strategies that can be implemented by the Company in making this assessment.
1409999_13_ITEM15_P43_S6	Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the period in which the net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce income taxes payable, management has established a valuation allowance such that the net deferred tax asset is $0 as of December 31, 2012 .

1409999_14_ITEM15_P17_S4	The Company is investigating other business opportunities and sources to develop revenue.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P18_S1	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less.

1409999_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC 820-10 (SFAS No. 157), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures " for financial assets and liabilities.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P20_S1	ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P21_S1	FASB ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P21_S2	The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:
1409999_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing ASC 740, Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109).
1409999_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	ASC 740 requires the measurement of deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry forwards, and of deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P24_S2	Measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of enacted tax law.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P24_S3	The effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not included in the measurement.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company recognizes the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events and transactions that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements or tax returns.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company currently has substantial net operating loss carry forwards.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets due to uncertainty of their ultimate realization.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P26_S2	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P27_S2	These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	The Company s activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital beyond 2013.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	Additionally, the Company s capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of the Company s researching for new markets.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P28_S2	The Company plans to continue financing its operations with cash received from financing activities, more specifically from related party loans.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	While the Company strongly believes that its capital resources will be sufficient in the near term, there is no assurance that the Company s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share, for the period presented.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P30_S2	Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P30_S3	Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P30_S4	Under this method, options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P30_S5	There is no potential dilutive security as of December 31, 2013.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	for the period, basic and diluted loss per share is the same for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	A promissory note for $500,000 was issued May 13, 2010 to EFT Holdings Inc.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	A series of advances was received from EFT Holdings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 totaling $300,000.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P33_S2	The note bears annual interest of 5%, requires no monthly payments, and matured November 13, 2010.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P33_S3	The note was extended indefinitely due on demand.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P33_S4	The note was paid down to $300,000 in January, 2011.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P33_S5	A further $20,000 was advanced August 17, 2012, and another $20,000 was advanced on December 11, 2012 increasing the loan balance to 340,000.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P33_S6	During 2013 a further $80,000 was advanced, bear an interest rate of 5% and with a term of one year, increasing the loan balance to $420,000.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	No provision was made for federal income tax for the year ended December 31, 2013, since the Company had net operating losses.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company has available net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $656,887, which begins to expire in 2029 unless utilized beforehand.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P35_S1	Net operating loss carry forwards may be used to reduce taxable income through the year 2033.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P35_S2	The availability of the Company s net operating loss carry forwards are subject to limitation if there is a 50% or more positive change in the ownership of the Company s stock.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P35_S3	As presented below, the Company generated a deferred tax asset through the net operating loss carry-forward.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P35_S4	However, a 100% valuation allowance has been established because the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss carryforwards are available.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P35_S5	Management considers projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and available tax planning strategies that can be implemented by the Company in making this assessment.
1409999_14_ITEM15_P35_S6	Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the period in which the net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce income taxes payable, management has established a full valuation allowance such that the net deferred tax asset is $0 as of December 31, 2013.

1409999_15_ITEM14_P7_S1	All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

1409999_15_ITEM14_P14_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.

1409999_15_ITEM14_P16_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing ASC 740, Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109).
1409999_15_ITEM14_P16_S1	ASC 740 requires the measurement of deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry forwards, and of deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P16_S2	Measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of enacted tax law.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P16_S3	The effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not included in the measurement.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P17_S0	The Company recognizes the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events and transactions that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements or tax returns.

1409999_15_ITEM14_P19_S0	The Company s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.

1409999_15_ITEM14_P19_S3	These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P20_S0	The Company s activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital beyond 2014.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P20_S1	Additionally, the Company s capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of the Company s researching for new markets.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P20_S2	The Company plans to continue financing its operations with cash received from financing activities, more specifically from related party loans.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P21_S0	While the Company strongly believes that its capital resources will be sufficient in the near term, there is no assurance that the Company s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P22_S0	Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share, for the period presented.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P22_S1	Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P22_S2	Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P22_S3	Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P22_S4	Under this method, options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P22_S5	There is no potential dilutive security as of December 31, 2014.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P22_S6	As there was a net loss for the period, basic and diluted loss per share is the same for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P23_S0	Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P24_S0	A promissory note for $500,000 was issued May 13, 2010 to EFT Holdings Inc.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P24_S1	A series of advances was received from EFT Holdings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 totaling $300,000.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P24_S2	The note bears annual interest of 5%, requires no monthly payments, and matured November 13, 2010.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P24_S3	The note was extended indefinitely due on demand.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P24_S4	The note was paid down to $300,000 in January, 2011.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P24_S5	A further $20,000 was advanced August 17, 2012, and another $20,000 was advanced on December 11, 2012 increasing the loan balance to 340,000.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P25_S0	During 2013 a further $80,000 was advanced, bearing an interest rate of 5% and with a term of one year, increasing the loan balance to $420,000.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P26_S0	A further $80,000 was advanced during 2014, bearing an interest rate of 5% and with a term of one year, increasing the loan balance to $500,000.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P27_S0	No provision was made for federal income tax for the year ended December 31, 2014, since the Company had net operating losses.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P28_S0	The Company has available net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $756,406 which begins to expire in 2029 unless utilized beforehand.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P28_S1	Net operating loss carry forwards may be used to reduce taxable income through the year 2034.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P28_S2	The availability of the Company s net operating loss carry forwards are subject to limitation if there is a 50% or more positive change in the ownership of the Company s stock.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P28_S3	As presented below, the Company generated a deferred tax asset through the net operating loss carry-forward.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P28_S4	However, a 100% valuation allowance has been established because the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss carryforwards are available.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P28_S5	Management considers projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and available tax planning strategies that can be implemented by the Company in making this assessment.
1409999_15_ITEM14_P28_S6	Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the period in which the net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce income taxes payable, management has established a full valuation allowance such that the net deferred tax asset is $0 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.

1409999_16_ITEM14_P8_S2	On May 19, 2009 the Company s name was changed to Digital Development Partners, Inc.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P9_S0	A reassessment of the Company s direction resulted in a reorganization plan on February 17, 2010 which included:

1409999_16_ITEM14_P11_S0	Pursuant to the plan, the Company s interests in Top Floor Studio and YuDeal Inc. were disposed of in February, 2010.

1409999_16_ITEM14_P13_S1	The Company is a development stage company.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P14_S0	The Company s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P14_S1	The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P14_S2	T he Company also has a working capital deficit as of December 31, 2015.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P14_S3	These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P15_S0	The Company s activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital beyond 2015.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P15_S1	Additionally, the Company s capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of the Company s researching for new markets.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P15_S2	The Company plans to continue financing its operations with cash received from financing activities, more specifically from related party loans.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P16_S0	While the Company strongly believes that its capital resources will be sufficient in the near term, there is no assurance that the Company s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P17_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.

1409999_16_ITEM14_P19_S1	ASC 740 requires the measurement of deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry forwards, and of deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P19_S2	Measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of enacted tax law.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P19_S3	The effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not included in the measurement.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P20_S0	The Company recognizes the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events and transactions that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements or tax returns.

1409999_16_ITEM14_P21_S1	The Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets due to uncertainty of their ultimate realization.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P21_S2	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P22_S0	Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share, for the period presented.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P22_S1	Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P22_S2	Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P22_S3	Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P22_S4	Under this method, options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P22_S5	There is no potential dilutive security as of December 31, 2015.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P22_S6	As there was a net loss for the period, basic and diluted loss per share is the same for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P23_S0	A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P23_S1	Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P23_S2	A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P24_S0	Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P25_S0	A promissory note was issued to EFT Holdings Inc. since 2010.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P25_S1	A series of advances was received from EFT Holdings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaling $70,000 and $80,000 respectively.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P25_S2	The amounts due EFT Holdings bear interest at 5% per year and are due in one year.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P26_S0	No provision was made for federal income tax for the year ended December 31, 2015, since the Company had net operating losses.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P27_S0	The Company has available net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $868,876, which begins to expire in 2029 unless utilized beforehand.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P27_S1	Net operating loss carry forwards may be used to reduce taxable income through the year 2035.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P27_S2	The availability of the Company s net operating loss carry forwards are subject to limitation if there is a 50% or more positive change in the ownership of the Company s stock.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P27_S3	As presented below, the Company generated a deferred tax asset through the net operating loss carry-forward.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P27_S4	However, a 100% valuation allowance has been established because the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss carryforwards are available.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P27_S5	Management considers projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and available tax planning strategies that can be implemented by the Company in making this assessment.
1409999_16_ITEM14_P27_S6	Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the period in which the net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce income taxes payable, management has established a full valuation allowance such that the net deferred tax asset is $0 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

1409999_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	See the financial statements attached to this report.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the direction and with the participation of the Company s management, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to The Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching its desired disclosure control objectives.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based upon this evaluation, management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2016 for the same reason that the Company s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting was not effective.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and implemented by The Company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of The Company s financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company s management evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of The Company s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016 since the Company did not have sufficient accounting personnel to support standalone external financial reporting under public company or requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1409999_17_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Specifically, the Company did not effectively segregate certain accounting duties due to the small size of its accounting staff, not did it maintain a sufficient number of adequately trained personnel necessary to anticipate and identify risks critical to financial reporting and the closing process.

1409999_17_ITEM14_P6_S1	As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has a working capital deficit and no source of revenue, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

1409999_17_ITEM14_P13_S2	T he Company also has a working capital deficit as of December 31, 2016.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P13_S3	These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P14_S0	The Company s activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital beyond 2016.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P14_S1	Additionally, the Company s capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of the Company s researching for new markets.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P14_S2	The Company plans to continue financing its operations with cash received from financing activities, more specifically from related party loans.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P15_S0	While the Company strongly believes that its capital resources will be sufficient in the near term, there is no assurance that the Company s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P16_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.

1409999_17_ITEM14_P18_S2	Measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of enacted tax law.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P18_S3	The effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not included in the measurement.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P19_S0	The Company recognizes the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events and transactions that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements or tax returns.

1409999_17_ITEM14_P20_S1	The Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets due to uncertainty of their ultimate realization.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P20_S2	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P21_S0	Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share, for the period presented.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P21_S1	Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P21_S2	Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P21_S3	Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P21_S4	Under this method, options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P21_S5	There is no potential dilutive securities as of December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P21_S6	As there was a net loss for these periods, basic and diluted loss per share is the same for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P22_S0	A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P22_S1	Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P22_S2	A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P23_S0	Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P24_S0	Advances were received from EFT Holdings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 totaling $80,000 and $70,000 respectively.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P24_S1	The amounts due EFT Holdings bear interest at 5% per year and are due on demand.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P24_S2	As of December 31, 2016 the Company owed EFT Holdings $145,508 in accrued and unpaid interest.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P25_S0	No provision was made for federal income tax for the year ended December 31, 2016, since the Company had net operating losses.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P26_S0	The Company has available net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $839,403, which begins to expire in 2029 unless utilized beforehand.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P26_S1	Net operating loss carry forwards may be used to reduce taxable income through the year 2035.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P26_S2	The availability of the Company s net operating loss carry forwards are subject to limitation if there is a 50% or more positive change in the ownership of the Company s stock.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P26_S3	As presented below, the Company generated a deferred tax asset through the net operating loss carry-forward.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P26_S4	However, a 100% valuation allowance has been established because the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss carryforwards are available.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P26_S5	Management considers projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and available tax planning strategies that can be implemented by the Company in making this assessment.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P26_S6	Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the period in which the net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce income taxes payable, management has established a full valuation allowance such that the net deferred tax asset is $0 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P27_S0	Subsequent to December 31, 2016 the Company borrowed $10,000 from EFT Holdings, a related party.
1409999_17_ITEM14_P27_S1	The amounts due EFT Holdings bear interest at 5% per year and are due on demand.

1409999_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to The Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1409999_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching its desired disclosure control objectives.
1409999_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based upon this evaluation, management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2017 for the same reason that the Company s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting was not effective.
1409999_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
1409999_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and implemented by The Company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of The Company s financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1409999_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1409999_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1409999_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company s management evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework.
1409999_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of The Company s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.
1409999_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2017 since the Company did not have sufficient accounting personnel to support standalone external financial reporting under public company or requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1409999_18_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Specifically, the Company did not effectively segregate certain accounting duties due to the small size of its accounting staff, not did it maintain a sufficient number of adequately trained personnel necessary to anticipate and identify risks critical to financial reporting and the closing process.
1409999_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A recognized material weakness would be a significant deficiency (within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 5), or combination of significant deficiencies, that would result in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their assigned functions. .

1409999_18_ITEM14_P22_S1	Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
