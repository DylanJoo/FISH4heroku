1001250_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	We expect that these systems will continue to provide pertinent inventory and sales data in the short term.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	However, as part of our long-term effort to enhance these systems and increase productivity, we are implementing our Strategic Modernization Initiative ( SMI ), which includes an enterprise-wide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands, operating units and sales locations.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	As part of SMI, we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to SAP, with the majority of our locations being enabled through fiscal 2013.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	In parallel with our SAP deployment, we are creating a more focused global information technology organization utilizing industry standard processes.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	We are also taking this opportunity to rebalance our information technology resources to better align with our global business growth.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P65_S2	We plan to continue to explore opportunities to create a more efficient organization.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	Of the many systems currently being utilized, the most significant to our business needs are: (i) a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer, or plan to offer, which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality; (ii) a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit ( SKU ) level at most significant retail sales locations (i.e. sell-through data), increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development, manufacturing and marketing strategies; (iii) an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers, allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically, with minimal paperwork; and (iv) an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to forecasted requirements.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	As we continue to modernize our key processes and the related systems and infrastructure, we have recently started the development of upgraded capabilities to support our human resource and retail operations.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	The initial focus for fiscal 2012 will be in North America.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	The plan is to progressively deploy these systems globally over the next three years as appropriate according to local requirements and priorities.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	Marketing, product development and packaging groups work with our research and development group to identify shifts in consumer preferences, develop new products and improve, redesign or reformulate existing products.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	In addition, research and development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis to provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	The research and development group has long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	Members of the group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	We do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, nor ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	We evaluate our finished products in clinical tests on volunteer panels.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	As of June 30, 2011, we had approximately 550 employees engaged in research and development.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	Research and development costs totaled $85.7 million, $79.5 million and $81.6 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P71_S3	We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, such as our new Shanghai research and development center, see Item 2.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	We manufacture our products primarily in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies and reduce costs.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P72_S2	Our major manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily manufacture one type of product (e.g., lipsticks) for all of the principal brands.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P72_S3	Our plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P72_S4	While we believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and productivity.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P72_S5	To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize third party manufacturers on a global basis, including an increased percentage of volume in Asia/Pacific to support our growth.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	We are continuously evaluating and restructuring this physical distribution network.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	We have begun to establish regional distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P74_S2	Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations department.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P74_S3	We are making a concentrated effort in supplier rationalization with the specific objective of reducing costs, increasing innovation and speed to market and improving quality.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P74_S4	In addition, we continue to focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P74_S5	As a result of sourcing initiatives, there is increased dependency on certain suppliers, but we believe that our portfolio of these suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	We are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will change suppliers, and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	The skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition throughout the world.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	Brand recognition, quality, performance and price have a significant impact on consumers choices among competing products and brands.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P77_S2	Advertising, promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store demonstrations also have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	With our numerous brands, sold in various channels, we are one of the world s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P78_S1	We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names.

1001250_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	We protect our trademarks in the United States and significant markets worldwide.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology in formulations or packaging.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	In addition, several products are covered by design patents, patent applications or copyrights.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	While we consider these patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is considered material to the conduct of our business.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	At June 30, 2011, we had approximately 32,300 full-time employees worldwide (including certain demonstrators at points of sale who are employed by us), of whom approximately 11,900 are employed in the United States and Canada.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	None of our employees in the United States is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P84_S2	In certain other countries, a limited number of employees are covered by a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	We believe that relations with our employees are good.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	We have never encountered a material strike or work stoppage in the United States or in any other country where we have a significant number of employees.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, labeling, packaging and marketing of our products.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P86_S2	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable Federal, state, local and international and other countries rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment or that relate to climate change.

1001250_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season and for fall fashion makeup introductions.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P88_S2	Many of our customers that are retailers follow a 4-4-5 retail calendar which may influence the amount and timing of their order placement and receipt of goods in any fiscal quarter.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	In a traditional 4-4-5 retail calendar, each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	As a result, the retail quarter-end and the fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.

1001250_11_ITEM1_P122_S1	Ms. Trower serves on the Board of Directors of Hollins University.
1001250_11_ITEM1_P123_S0	Each executive officer serves for a one-year term ending at the next annual meeting of the Board of Directors, subject to his or her applicable employment agreement and his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading prices of our securities, may be adversely affected.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors actions in these areas.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	For example, the fragrance category in the United States has in the past been influenced by the high volume of new product introductions by diverse companies across several different distribution channels.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Also, the consolidation in the retail trade has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers, including large-format retailers, who have increased their bargaining strength.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	This trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P4_S5	A severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, their attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We must continually work to develop, produce and market new products, maintain and adapt our High-Touch services to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The issue is compounded by the increasing use of social and digital media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our financial results will suffer.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Achieving our long-term objectives will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, technologies and geographic markets.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These investments may result in short-term costs without any current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings, at least in the short term.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or special charges in doing so.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If required, the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Acquisitions entail numerous risks, which may include:
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from, or customers of, acquired businesses; diversion of management s attention from our core businesses; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances warrant, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	A general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P16_S7	If a retailer was to liquidate, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer s inventory of our products to protect brand equity.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or those that are currently taking place in the Middle East, or as a result of a terrorist attack, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation, or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes or seismic events, can have a short and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Events that impact consumers willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling may impact our travel retail business, which is a significant contributor to our overall results.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A downturn in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect our sales and profitability.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	While we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers standards, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our key personnel.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Competition for these employees can be intense.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P27_S5	This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are subject to risks related to our foreign operations.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We operate on a global basis, with a majority of our fiscal 2011 net sales and operating income generated outside the United States.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely, except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	A portion of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the United States.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We maintain offices in over 40 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which can affect our results of operations, the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and the cost of certain inventory and non-inventory items required in our operations; changes in foreign laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on trade, import and export license requirements, and tariffs and taxes, as well as changes in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment; and adverse weather conditions, social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	A disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality control, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages, hacking and other risks.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We have information systems that support our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We have e-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P38_S4	The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	As part of SMI, we are implementing enterprise-wide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands, regions and functions.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We anticipate the continued migration of our operations to SAP, with the majority of our locations to be enabled through fiscal 2013.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Like most entity-wide changes to software systems, the implementation of SMI involves risks and uncertainties.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Failure to implement SMI as planned, in terms of timing, specifications and/or costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal 2011, we provided guidance as to a number of assumptions, including our expected net sales and earnings per share for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 and the quarter ending September 30, 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P43_S4	While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P43_S5	In addition, the longer-term guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our net sales and/or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q).
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P45_S5	We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information with respect to customers and employees.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Moreover, the success of our e-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees and customers personal information, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees and customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P47_S5	In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	As we outsource more functions, we will become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	As part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	These include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations, and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are controlled by the Lauder family.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	As a result of their control of us, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	As of August 15, 2011, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having approximately 86.8% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, there are five members of the Lauder family who are employees, including three who are members of our Board of Directors.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P52_S3	As a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the Company, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including, without limitation, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets, for the foreseeable future.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a controlled company under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	As a controlled company, we are exempt under the New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities; and that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	While we have voluntarily caused our Board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and the Compensation Committee to have the required provisions, we are not requiring our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and Compensation Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors.
1001250_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	As a result of our use of the controlled company exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.
1001250_11_ITEM1B_P0_S0	As of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, there were no unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1001250_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following table sets forth our principal owned and leased manufacturing, assembly, research and development and distribution facilities as of August 15, 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	The leases expire at various times through 2027 subject to certain renewal options.
1001250_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own, lease and occupy numerous offices, assembly and distribution facilities and warehouses in the United States and abroad.
1001250_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	We consider our properties to be generally in good condition and believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet anticipated requirements.
1001250_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	We lease approximately 400,000 square feet of rentable space for our principal offices in New York, New York and own an office building of approximately 57,000 square feet in Melville, New York.
1001250_11_ITEM2_P1_S3	As of August 15, 2011, we operated approximately 750 freestanding retail stores.
1001250_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business.
1001250_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	However, management s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.
1001250_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	Reasonably possible losses in addition to the amount accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to our consolidated financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A Common Stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EL.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table shows the high and low sales prices as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010:
1001250_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	We expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future, but there can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will continue to declare them.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	In November 2010 and 2009, the Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.75 and $.55, respectively, which was paid in December 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of August 15, 2011, there were approximately 7,695 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 17 record holders of Class B Common Stock.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 88.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	As of June 30, 2011, the cumulative total of acquired shares pursuant to the authorization was 74.9 million, reducing the remaining authorized share repurchase balance to 13.1 million.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P3_S2	During fiscal 2011, we purchased approximately 5.0 million shares pursuant to the authorization for $376.9 million as outlined in the following table:
1001250_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	(1) The initial program covering the repurchase of 8.0 million shares was announced in September 1998 and increased by 20.0 million shares each in November 2007, February 2007 and May 2005 and 10.0 million shares in both May 2004 and October 2002.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	(2) Includes shares that were repurchased by the Company in connection with shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations upon the settlement of performance share units.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P4_S2	(3) Includes shares that were repurchased by the Company in connection with shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock units.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	Subsequent to June 30, 2011, we purchased approximately 2.8 million additional shares of Class A Common Stock for $280.1 million pursuant to our share repurchase program.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	Shares of Class B Common Stock may be converted immediately into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis by the holder and are automatically converted into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis upon transfer to a person or entity that is not a Permitted Transferee or soon after a record date for a meeting of stockholders where the outstanding Class B Common Stock constitutes less than 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P6_S1	There is no cash or other consideration paid by the holder converting the shares and, accordingly, there is no cash or other consideration received by the Company.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P6_S2	The shares of Class A Common Stock issued by the Company in such conversions are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) thereof.
1001250_11_ITEM5_P7_S0	During the three months ended June 30, 2011, the stockholder set forth in the table below converted shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock on the date set forth below:
1001250_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The table below summarizes selected financial information.
1001250_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto beginning on page F-1 of this report.
1001250_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Fiscal 2011 results included $41.7 million, after tax, or $.21 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	Fiscal 2010 results included $55.9 million, after tax, or $.28 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_11_ITEM6_P1_S2	Fiscal 2009 results included $61.7 million, after tax, or $.31 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	In November 2008, we issued and sold $300.0 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due November 1, 2013 in a public offering.
1001250_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	We used the net proceeds of this offering to repay then-outstanding commercial paper balances upon their maturity.
1001250_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	(c) On May 24, 2010, we completed a cash tender offer for $130.0 million principal amount of our 2012 Senior Notes at a price of 108.500% of the principal amount and for $69.9 million principal amount of our 2013 Senior Notes at a tender price of 118.813% of the principal amount.
1001250_11_ITEM6_P3_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $27.3 million representing the tender premium, the pro-rata write-off of unamortized terminated interest rate swap, issuance costs and debt discount, and tender offer costs associated with both series of notes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2011 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, income taxes and derivatives.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at our retail stores.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	In accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.5%, 4.3% and 4.4% in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and the improvement reflects efforts to work with our customers to improve their forecasting and product mix to better address their inventory requirements.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	This accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	Experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P5_S4	In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P5_S5	The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $33.9 million and $34.3 million as of June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by $9.9 million, $15.8 million and $14.1 million for customer deductions and write-offs in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and increased by $9.5 million, $8.7 million and $29.2 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	We believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead, as well as inbound freight.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P7_S5	Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan ( U.S. Qualified Plan ) and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the Domestic Plans a domestic contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	The amounts needed to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	While we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	For fiscal 2011, we used a discount rate for our Domestic Plans of 5.40% and varying rates on our international plans of between 1.25% and 8.25%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	The discount rate for our Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	We believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	For fiscal 2011, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of between 2.50% and 8.00% for our international plans.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies, see Item 8.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 Pension, Deferred Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Plans for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	For fiscal 2011, our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $92 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $57 million, which resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately $35 million, substantially all of which is currently subject to be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 6 to 25 years.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	The actual return on assets was primarily related to the performance of equity markets during the past fiscal year.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	A 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2011 pension expense:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2011 would have had the following effects:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	For fiscal 2012, we are using a discount rate for the Domestic Plans of 5.40% and varying rates for our international plans of between 1.25% and 8.25%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	We are using an expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 2.00% and 8.25%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	The net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2011 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $0.4 million in fiscal 2012.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	We will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	We make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	Impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge is recorded.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	The assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	We use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and, in certain instances, we engage third-party valuation specialists for advice.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	To determine fair value of the reporting unit, we generally use an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	In certain circumstances, equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable (e.g., only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins).
1001250_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	We believe both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Under the income approach, we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Under the market approach, we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, to value the reporting unit.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	The fiscal 2011 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections, as considered appropriate for the individual reporting units, ranged between 3% and 19% with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The fiscal 2010 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first four to eight years of our projections ranged between 3% and 24% with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2010.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	For reporting units with positive earnings, growth in the corresponding earnings before interest and taxes ranged from 6% to 109% in fiscal 2011 as compared with 9% to 161% in fiscal 2010.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	The terminal growth rates were projected at 3% after four to eight years in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P26_S4	The weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from 7.5% to 16% in fiscal 2011 as compared with 9% to 17% in fiscal 2010.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P26_S5	The range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2011 impairment testing was from 1.5 to 3 times trailing-twelve-month sales and 11 to 12 times trailing-twelve-month earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P26_S6	The range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2010 impairment testing was from 0.5 to 3 times trailing-twelve-month sales and between 9 to 12 times trailing-twelve-month earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P26_S7	Future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P26_S8	However, a decrease of 100 basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of 100 basis points in our weighted-average cost of capital would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units, except for the Ojon reporting unit, see Item 7.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairments.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	To determine fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we use an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The fiscal 2011 and 2010 terminal growth rate applied to future cash flows was 3% and the fiscal 2011 and 2010 discount rates ranged from 10% to 18% and 11% to 19%, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The fiscal 2011 and 2010 royalty rates ranged from 0.5% to 12% and 0.5% to11%, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	As of June 30, 2011, we have current net deferred tax assets of $260.7 million and non-current net deferred tax assets of $61.1 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of $69.5 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	Based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	If we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P34_S4	For those tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	We classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	In certain circumstances, the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render them inestimable.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	We enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Hedge effectiveness is documented, assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	Variables that are external to us such as social, political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	All derivatives outstanding as of June 30, 2011 are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ( fair-value hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( foreign currency cash-flow hedge), or (iii) not designated as a hedging instrument.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge that is highly effective are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments).
1001250_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a foreign currency cash-flow hedge of a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ).
1001250_11_ITEM7_P39_S4	Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).
1001250_11_ITEM7_P39_S5	Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	For a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments, see Item 7.

1001250_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	During the three-year period ended June 30, 2011 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	The results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	For fiscal 2011, had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately $4.8 million, operating expenses would have changed by approximately $0.8 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.7 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	The collective impact of these changes on operating income, net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc., and net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately $5.6 million, $6.3 million and $.03, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	We manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The following table is a comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Item 8.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 20 Segment Data and Related Information for all periods presented.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, sampling and merchandising and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	The economics of developing, producing, launching and supporting products impact our sales and operating performance each period.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	Therefore, we present certain net sales information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	We calculate constant currency information by translating current-period results using prior year weighted average foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	We believe that the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing their changing shopping habits.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	To be the global leader in prestige beauty, we are implementing a long-term strategy that is guiding us through fiscal 2014.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	The strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands and functions that are designed to leverage our strengths, make us more productive and grow our sales.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We believe we have a strong, diverse brand portfolio with global reach and potential.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	Our strategy continues to build on and leverage our history of outstanding creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	We have succeeded in expanding our High-Touch service model and will continue to look for ways to expand it in newer channels and within geographic regions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	We are expanding our efforts to evolve our e-commerce-based online strategy into a multi-pronged digital strategy encompassing e-commerce, as well as digital and social media.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P53_S4	We are leveraging our regional organization in an effort to assure that we are locally relevant in each market.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	As part of our strategy, we are continuing to shift our category mix towards higher margin categories with greater global growth potential.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	Skin care, our most profitable product category, is a strategic priority for our innovation and investment spending, particularly in the Asia/Pacific region.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	We also focused our attention on luxury consumers across all categories and have seen an improvement in the net sales of many of our higher-end prestige products, due to an improvement in the luxury retail environment.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	We are strengthening our geographic presence by seeking share growth in large, image-building cities within core markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Japan.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	In addition, we continue to prioritize efforts to expand our presence and accelerate share growth in emerging markets such as China, Russia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Brazil.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	We continue to expand our digital presence which resulted in continued growth in net sales of our products sold over the Internet.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	In North America, we recognized the need to drive profitable growth in our traditional department store channel and saw many benefits from the changes we implemented in prior years and continued to reshape our organization to meet the needs of the changing retail landscape.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P55_S4	Internationally, we took actions to continue profitable growth in European perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores in Asia, while emphasizing our skin care and makeup initiatives to boost our travel retail business and continuing efforts to grow our online, specialty retailer and prestige salon businesses.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P55_S5	The travel retail business continues to be a source of sales growth and profitability.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P55_S6	Our business in this channel is benefiting from the implementation of programs we designed to enhance consumers High-Touch experiences and convert travelers into purchasers.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P55_S7	In addition, we see travel retail as another way to capture the attention of travelers from emerging markets, who either buy in the channel, in stores at their destination or when they return to their homes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our High-Touch approach to marketing our products is a key component of our strategy.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	It is designed to promote the total value we offer, by leveraging our in-person and virtual assets, as well as merchandising and education, to provide a customized consumer experience.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	In fiscal 2011, we continued to invest in High-Touch service capabilities in existing channels, such as the roll-out of new department store formats, as well as newer channels, such as m-commerce.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	While most of the focus is on increasing sales and taking advantage of appropriate opportunities in each market, we continued to implement other initiatives designed to drive out non-value added costs, optimize productivity and increase financial discipline.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	To optimize our portfolio, we are continuing to focus on improving our margins and share in our distribution channels.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	We are also continuing to re-energize certain of our brands through the introduction of products that feature advances in research and technology and focused marketing campaigns.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P57_S3	At the same time, we are investing in initiatives to incubate and develop next generation products and brands, as well as continuing our overall success in driving turnaround brands toward sustainable profitability levels.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P57_S4	We are continuing to build our regional organizations and leveraging them to increase effectiveness and efficiencies while utilizing strategic partnerships, alliances and licensing to build scale in research and development, distribution and third-party manufacturing.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	At this time, we do not believe the recent economic uncertainty and financial market volatility taking place in the United States and certain European countries will have a significant impact on our business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	This is due in part to our belief that we are better positioned as a result of our strategy to manage our business effectively and efficiently and we will allocate resources appropriately.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	However, if the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsens or is prolonged, then there will likely be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence, demand and spending and as a result, our business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	Currently, we believe general economic and other uncertainties still exist in select markets in which we do business such as in Japan, North America and certain countries in Europe.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P58_S4	We continue to monitor global economic uncertainties and other risks that may affect our business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P58_S5	The disasters that occurred in Japan during the fiscal year did not have a significant impact on our business or our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P58_S6	At this time, we believe the ongoing consequences may continue for the short term, however, we cannot predict with certainty the magnitude or duration of the impact and we will continue to monitor the situation.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Looking ahead to fiscal 2012, we plan to continue building on our strengths.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	We have a strong, diverse and highly valuable brand portfolio with global reach and potential, as well as a track record of outstanding creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship and healthy growth.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	We believe our High-Touch service model has potential beyond department stores, and believe we have a passionate, highly-talented workforce to help us achieve our long-term strategy.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	Our balance sheet, cash flows and gross margin are strong, however, we continue to operate in a challenging environment.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P59_S4	While net sales and operating results improved dramatically from fiscal 2010, we do not expect the same levels of year-over-year improvements to continue.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P59_S5	We have a number of areas to improve, including further enhancements to our cost structure, sharing operational best practices internally, increasing traffic to where our products are sold, and further diversification of distribution channels.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P59_S6	We also plan on continuing to allocate our spending to the significant modernization of our global information systems, which includes our Strategic Modernization Initiative as well as other initiatives, and shift our focus from gift with purchase activities to advertising, merchandising and sampling initiatives.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P59_S7	We expect these strategies will help improve our cost of sales margin but will increase our operating expense margin over the next fiscal year.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	In an effort to drive down costs and achieve synergies within our organization, in February 2009, we announced the implementation of a multi-faceted cost savings program (the Program ) to position the Company to achieve long-term profitable growth.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	We anticipate the Program will result in related restructuring and other special charges, inclusive of cumulative charges recorded to date and through the remainder of the Program, totaling between $350 million and $450 million before taxes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	While we will continue to seek cost savings opportunities, our current plans are to identify and approve specific initiatives under the Program through fiscal 2012 and execute those initiatives through fiscal 2013.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	The total amount of charges (pre-tax) associated with the Program recorded, plus other initiatives approved through June 30, 2011, is approximately $303 million to $308 million, of which approximately $198.5 million to $200 million relates to restructuring charges, approximately $50 million of other costs to implement the initiatives, approximately $38.5 million to $42 million in sales returns and approximately $16 million in inventory write-offs.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P60_S4	The restructuring charges are comprised of approximately $151.5 million to $153 million of employee-related costs, approximately $27 million of other exit costs and contract terminations (substantially all of which have resulted in or will result in cash expenditures), and approximately $20 million in non-cash asset write-offs.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P60_S5	The total amount of cumulative charges (pre-tax) associated with the Program recorded from inception through June 30, 2011 was $239.4 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	We expect that the implementation of this Program, combined with other on-going cost savings efforts, will result in savings of approximately $675 million to $725 million (program inception through the end of fiscal 2011 is approximately $560 million) including the reduction of certain costs relative to an assumed normalized spending pattern.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	Our long-range forecast for operating margin reflects these anticipated savings, net of strategic reinvestments.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Program focuses on a redesign of our organizational structure in order to integrate the Company in a more cohesive way and operate more globally across brands and functions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	The principal aspect of the Program was the reduction of the workforce by approximately 2,000 employees.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	Specific actions taken during fiscal 2011 and 2010 included:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Resize and Reorganize the Organization We continued the realignment and optimization of our organization to better leverage scale, improve productivity, reduce complexity and achieve cost savings in each region and across various functions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	This included reduction of the workforce which occurred through the consolidation of certain functions, which we achieved through a combination of normal attrition and job eliminations, and the closure and consolidation of certain distribution and office facilities.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Turnaround or Exit Unprofitable Operations To improve the profitability in certain of our brands and regions, we have selectively exited certain channels of distribution, categories and markets, and have made changes to turnaround others.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	This included the exit from the global wholesale distribution of our Prescriptives brand and the reformulation of Ojon brand products.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	In connection with these activities, we incurred charges for product returns, inventory write-offs, reduction of workforce and termination of contracts.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Outsourcing In order to balance the growing need for information technology support with our efforts to provide the most efficient and cost effective solutions, we continued the outsourcing of certain information technology processes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	We incurred costs to transition services to outsource providers and employee-related costs.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	The following table presents aggregate restructuring charges related to the Program:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	The following table presents accrued restructuring charges and the related activity under the Program:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Accrued restructuring charges at June 30, 2011 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately $29 million, $6 million and $2 million in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table presents total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities related to the Program:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	During fiscal 2011, we recorded $4.6 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $1.2 million) and a write-off of inventory of $7.0 million associated with turnaround operations, primarily related to the reformulation of Ojon brand products.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	During fiscal 2010, we recorded $15.7 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $2.5 million) and $10.4 million for the write-off of inventory associated with exiting unprofitable operations, primarily related to the exit from the global wholesale distribution of the Prescriptives brand.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	During fiscal 2009, we recorded $8.1 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $1.2 million) and a write-off of inventory of $8.0 million associated with exiting unprofitable operations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Other special charges in connection with the implementation of actions taken under this Program primarily relate to consulting and other professional services.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	As of our annual step-one goodwill impairment test on April 1, 2011, all reporting units fair values substantially exceeded their respective carrying values.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	As of our annual indefinite-lived asset impairment test on April 1, 2011, we determined, as a result of a planned discontinuation, that the carrying values of two brand trademarks exceeded their estimated fair values, which were based on the use of a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows ( relief-from-royalty method ).
1001250_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $1.7 million for the carrying values of the related trademarks.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P74_S3	These impairment charges were reflected in the makeup and skin care product categories and in the Americas region.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P74_S4	We also determined that the trademark related to the Darphin reporting unit had an estimated fair value exceeding its carrying value by approximately 13% and the trademark related to the Ojon reporting unit had an estimated fair value that equals its carrying value.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P74_S5	As of June 30, 2011, the carrying values of the trademarks were $9.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P74_S6	The estimated fair values of the trademarks were based upon the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P74_S7	The key assumptions that were used to determine the estimated fair value of the Darphin trademark were predicated on new market initiatives including expanded international distribution.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	The key assumptions that were used to determine the estimated fair value of the Ojon trademark were predicated on new market initiatives including expanded international distribution and consumer reception to the reformulated product line.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	If such plans do not materialize, if there is a delay in new market initiatives, or if there is a decline in the business environment, a resulting change in the key assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these trademarks and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	The fair values of all other indefinite-lived intangible assets substantially exceeded their respective carrying values.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Ojon reporting unit reassessed and subsequently altered the timing of new market initiatives, including the rollout of reformulated product lines and certain components of its future international expansion plans, resulting in revisions to its internal forecasts.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	We concluded that these changes in circumstances in the Ojon reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark and goodwill.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	Additionally, these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amount of the customer list may not be recoverable.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P77_S3	We performed an interim impairment test for the trademark and a recoverability test for the customer list as of February 28, 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P77_S4	For the customer list, we concluded that the carrying amount of this asset was recoverable.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P77_S5	However, for the Ojon trademark, we concluded that the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P77_S6	As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $7.0 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P77_S7	After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, we completed an interim impairment test for goodwill and recorded an impairment charge for the remaining goodwill related to the Ojon reporting unit of $29.3 million, at the exchange rate in effect at that time.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	The fair value of the reporting unit was based upon the income approach, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	In fiscal 2010, the income approach was used in conjunction with the market approach but due to the reporting unit s existing negative margins, the market approach was deemed not applicable.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	These impairment charges were reflected in the hair care and skin care product categories and in the Americas region.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Although our financial performance reflected improved economic conditions, we expect global economic uncertainties to continue to impact our business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	As the duration and magnitude of the volatility of the current economic conditions remain uncertain, we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on our business and on our interim and annual impairment testing.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	Accordingly, it is possible that we would recognize an impairment charge in the future with respect to goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Net sales increased 13%, or $1,014.2 million, to $8,810.0 million, reflecting increases in all geographic regions and product categories.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 12%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	During fiscal 2010, we undertook an initiative to identify certain underperforming stock keeping units ( SKUs ) for the purposes of evaluating their relevance to our long-term perfumery strategy in the Europe, the Middle East Africa region.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	Based on this evaluation, we decided to discontinue certain of these products in perfumeries and recorded a charge of approximately $31 million to reflect then-anticipated returns of products from participating retailers.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	This resulted in a favorable comparison with fiscal 2010.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	The following discussions of Net Sales by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of $4.6 million and $15.7 million recorded during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	We believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Net sales of skin care products increased 15%, or $491.5 million, to $3,718.6 million, reflecting the success of our strategic focus on growing this category.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	The recent launches of the Re-Nutriv Ultimate Lift Age-Correcting and Hydrationist Collections, Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator and Idealist Cooling Eye Illuminator from Est e Lauder contributed incremental sales of approximately $102 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	Also contributing incremental sales to the category were the recent launches of Repairwear Laser Focus Wrinkle UV Damage Corrector from Clinique and the Plantscription line of products from Origins of approximately $88 million, combined.

1001250_11_ITEM7_P84_S5	Higher sales of the Time Zone line of products from Est e Lauder, Derma White Clinical from Clinique and The Regenerating Serum from La Mer contributed approximately $48 million to the increase.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P84_S6	These increases were partially offset by approximately $108 million of lower sales from existing products in the Advanced Night Repair line from Est e Lauder and Cyber White EX from Clinique.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P84_S7	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 13%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	Makeup net sales increased 13%, or $392.6 million, to $3,370.8 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	The increase in makeup net sales primarily reflected higher net sales from our makeup artist brands and the inclusion of Smashbox of approximately $322 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	The recent launches of Pure Color eyeshadow products and Pure Color Long Lasting Lipstick from Est e Lauder and Redness Solutions Makeup from Clinique contributed approximately $57 million, to the increase.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P85_S3	The higher results also reflect the favorable comparison to the prior year which included a charge related to our long-term perfumery strategy, as previously discussed, of approximately $27 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P85_S4	These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Prescriptives products due to the exit from the global wholesale distribution of the brand in fiscal 2010, as well as lower sales of Superfit Makeup from Clinique and Resilience Lift Extreme Makeup from Est e Lauder of approximately $45 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P85_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 12%.

1001250_11_ITEM7_P86_S3	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of DKNY Delicious Candy Apples, Est e Lauder Sensuous and I Am King Sean John of approximately $18 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	While results in fiscal 2011 reflect implementation of our long-term strategy for the category, we continue to expect challenges due to competitive dynamics.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased 8%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	Hair care net sales increased 4%, or $18.4 million, to $432.3 million, primarily reflecting the recent launches of Be Curly Style-Prep and Control Force from Aveda.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	The category also benefited from net sales generated from expanded global distribution.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	These increases were partially offset by the current-year reformulation of Ojon brand products, which was relaunched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	The impact of foreign currency translation on hair care net sales was de minimis.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	Net sales in the Americas increased 10%, or $354.2 million, to $3,796.3 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	The increase in the current year was primarily attributable to growth in the United States and Canada from our heritage and makeup artist brands, which benefited from an improved retail environment, new skin care and makeup product offerings and an increase in sales of higher-end prestige skin care products.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	Net sales also reflected the addition of the Smashbox brand to our portfolio.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P90_S3	While partially offset by the exit from the global wholesale distribution of the Prescriptives brand and the current-year reformulation of Ojon brand products, all of these factors contributed to higher net sales in the United States and Canada of approximately $328 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P90_S4	We are continuing to work with retailers in the U.S. department store channel on strengthening the High-Touch concepts used to help market our products.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Net sales in Latin America increased approximately $26 million, reflecting growth in emerging markets such as Brazil.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	The growth in this region was partially offset by the impact of unfavorable exchange rates in Venezuela.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	The impact of foreign currency translation on the Americas net sales was de minimis.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, net sales increased 14%, or $398.3 million, to $3,257.6 million, due to growth from our travel retail business and from most countries in the region and from each product category.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	This reflects our strategy to strengthen our geographic presence and to succeed in the travel retail channel.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	Approximately $306 million of the increased net sales came from our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, Russia, the Middle East, South Africa and France.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P92_S3	This was attributable to improved retail environments, successful launches of skin care products and higher combined sales from our makeup artist brands.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P92_S4	The net sales improvement in our travel retail business also reflected an increase in global airline passenger traffic, new points of distribution and benefits of programs designed to enhance consumers High-Touch experiences and convert travelers into purchasers.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P92_S5	The higher results also reflect the favorable comparison to the prior year which included a charge related to our long-term perfumery strategy of approximately $31 million, as previously discussed.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P92_S6	Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of approximately $13 million in the Balkans and Spain, primarily reflecting the economic situation in those markets.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P92_S7	The impact of foreign currency translation on Europe, the Middle East Africa net sales was de minimis.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 17%, or $250.6 million, to $1,760.7 million, reflecting growth from all countries in the region and each product category.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	This reflects our strategy to strengthen and expand our geographic presence in Asia, particularly in China.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	Approximately $181 million of this increase was generated in China, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan primarily reflecting strong sales of skin care products.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P93_S3	Our businesses in Japan and Australia continued to be challenged due to difficult economic conditions, but they reported net sales gains of approximately $33 million, which were generated from the strengthening of their respective currencies.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P93_S4	At this time, we believe the ongoing consequences of the disasters in Japan may continue for the short term, however, we cannot predict with certainty the magnitude or duration of the impact and we will continue to monitor the situation.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	The region also benefited from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 10%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Although our financial performance in fiscal 2011 reflected improved economic conditions in certain countries, we expect the recent global economic uncertainties and volatility in financial markets will have an impact on our business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	Unless the current conditions worsen or are prolonged, the impact will not be significant.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	We cannot predict with certainty the magnitude or duration of the impact of global economic uncertainties and volatilities or how it will vary across each of our geographic regions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 22.0% as compared with 23.5% in the prior year.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	This improvement primarily reflected our efforts in connection with the Program, including favorable changes in the mix of our business of approximately 70 basis points and favorable manufacturing variances of 30 basis points.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	Also contributing to the improvements of cost of sales margin was the favorable effect of exchange rates of 30 basis points and a decrease in obsolescence charges of approximately 20 basis points.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of potential new brands or channels of distribution which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 65.6% as compared with 66.4% in the prior year, and reflects the impact of the strong growth in net sales during fiscal 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	This improvement primarily reflected lower selling and shipping costs as a percentage of net sales of approximately 120 basis points due to various cost containment efforts implemented as part of the Program and a strategically focused approach to spending.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	Also contributing to the improvement were a decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales of 40 basis points, lower charges associated with restructuring activities of 20 basis points, lower charges associated with intangible asset impairments of 20 basis points and lower net losses from foreign exchange transactions of 10 basis points.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P100_S3	Partially offsetting these improvements were increased spending in advertising, merchandising and sampling costs in line with our strategy of 120 basis points and higher costs related to stock-based compensation of approximately 30 basis points.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	Changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Operating income increased 38%, or $299.5 million, to $1,089.4 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	Operating margin improved to 12.4% of net sales as compared with 10.1% in the prior year, reflecting our higher gross margin and the decrease in our operating expense margin, as previously discussed.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of $59.4 million, or 0.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2011 and $84.7 million, or 1.1% of net sales, in fiscal 2010.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	We believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	All product categories benefited from initiatives we implemented as part of the Program including a more strategically focused approach to spending.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	Skin care operating income increased 37%, or $160.8 million, to $595.1 million, primarily reflecting improved results from all of our heritage brands driven by increased net sales from higher-margin product launches.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P104_S2	Makeup operating income increased 18%, or $77.0 million, to $493.8 million, primarily reflecting improved results from our makeup artist brands and from our larger heritage brands.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P104_S3	The higher results also reflect the favorable comparison to the prior year which included a charge to the category related to our long-term perfumery strategy, as previously discussed, of approximately $30 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P104_S4	Fragrance operating income increased over 100%, or $54.4 million, to $80.7 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales from Est e Lauder and designer fragrances driven by recent product launches, improved cost of goods and a more strategically focused approach to spending as part of our strategy to improve profitability.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P104_S5	Hair care operating results decreased 47%, or $2.9 million, reflecting the reformulation and relaunch of Ojon brand products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P104_S6	This decrease was partially offset by higher results from Aveda.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P104_S7	The category also reflected goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $33 million as compared with $36 million in the prior year.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	Operating results in each of our geographic regions benefited from the initiatives we implemented as part of the Program and a more strategically focused approach to spending, as well as significant improvement in cost of sales from favorable product mix and enhanced inventory management, resulting in significant improvements in their operating income.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Operating income in the Americas increased 52%, or $83.4 million, to $244.9 million, reflecting strong sales from our heritage and makeup artist brands, partially offset by incremental spending in line with our strategy.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, operating income increased 30%, or $151.1 million, to $651.9 million, reflecting higher results from our travel retail business, Russia, the United Kingdom and the Middle East of approximately $94 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	Partially offsetting these improvements were lower results in the Balkans and Spain of approximately $9 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P107_S2	The higher results also reflected a favorable comparison to the prior year which included a charge related to our long-term perfumery strategy, as previously discussed, of approximately $34 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 19%, or $39.7 million, to $252.0 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	Virtually all countries in the region reported higher operating results, led by approximately $46 million in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P108_S2	Partially offsetting these increases were lower operating results of approximately $7 million in Japan and Australia.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P108_S3	At this time, we believe the ongoing consequences of the disasters in Japan may continue for the short term, however, we cannot predict with certainty the magnitude or duration of the impact and we will continue to monitor the situation.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	Net interest expense was $63.9 million as compared with $74.3 million in the prior year.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	Interest expense decreased primarily due to a reduction of debt balances that resulted from the $200 million debt tender offer we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed a cash tender offer for $130.0 million principal amount of our 2012 Senior Notes at a price of 108.500% of the principal amount and for $69.9 million principal amount of our 2013 Senior Notes at a tender price of 118.813% of the principal amount.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $27.3 million representing the tender premium of $24.2 million, the pro-rata write-off of $2.4 million of unamortized terminated interest rate swap, issuance costs and debt discount, and $0.7 million in tender offer costs associated with both series of notes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 31.4% as compared with 29.9% in the prior year.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	The increase in the effective income tax rate of 150 basis points was principally due to a decrease in favorable tax reserve adjustments as compared with the prior year.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. as compared with fiscal 2010 increased 47%, or $222.5 million, to $700.8 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased 46% from $2.38 to $3.48.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	The results in the current year include the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of $41.7 million, after tax, or $0.21 per diluted common share.

1001250_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	Net sales increases in the skin care, makeup and hair care product categories were partially offset by declines in the fragrance category.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P115_S2	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 5%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	The following discussions of Net Sales by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of $15.7 million recorded during fiscal 2010.

1001250_11_ITEM7_P118_S4	These increases were partially offset by approximately $92 million of lower sales from existing products in the Advanced Night Repair and Perfectionist lines from Est e Lauder and in the Superdefense line from Clinique.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P118_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 9%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	Makeup net sales increased 5%, or $147.3 million, to $2,978.2 million, primarily reflecting an increase of approximately $135 million from our makeup artist brands, driven by higher net sales outside the United States.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	SPF 15 from Est e Lauder, as well as higher sales of Double Wear Foundation from Est e Lauder and Vitamin C Lip Smoothie Antioxidant Lip Colour from Clinique, contributed approximately $74 million, combined, to the increase.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P119_S2	These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Prescriptives products due to the exit from the global wholesale distribution of the brand, as well as lower sales of High Impact Lip Color SPF 15 from Clinique and Artist s Eye Pencils from Est e Lauder of approximately $50 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	During fiscal 2010, we undertook an initiative to identify certain underperforming SKUs for the purposes of evaluating their relevance to our long-term perfumery strategy in the Europe, the Middle East Africa region.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	Based on this evaluation, we decided to discontinue certain of these products in perfumeries and recorded a charge of approximately $27 million to reflect the anticipated returns of makeup products from participating retailers, subject to our returns approval policy.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P120_S2	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 4%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	Net sales of fragrance products decreased 1%, or $14.0 million, to $1,136.9 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	This decline was largely due to lower sales of certain designer fragrances, of which approximately $54 million was attributable to DKNY Delicious Night, Hilfiger Men, Sean John Unforgivable Woman, Sean John Unforgivable and DKNY Men.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	Also contributing to the decrease were lower sales of Est e Lauder Sensuous and Clinique Happy of approximately $15 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P121_S3	These declines were partially offset by incremental sales from the fiscal 2010 launches of pure DKNY, Very Hollywood Michael Kors and DKNY Delicious Candy Apples, as well as higher sales of DKNY Be Delicious Fresh Blossom, of approximately $53 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P121_S4	The decrease in net sales was due in part to a more strategically focused approach to investment spending in this category.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P121_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales decreased 2%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	Hair care net sales increased 3%, or $11.5 million, to $413.9 million, primarily reflecting an increase in net sales of certain styling and hair color products, the fiscal 2010 launches of Smooth Infusion Glossing Straightener and Control Force from Aveda and sales generated from expanded distribution outside the United States.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	This increase was partially offset by lower net sales in North America resulting from a soft salon retail environment and the closing of certain underperforming freestanding retail stores.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 2%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	Net sales in the Americas increased 1%, or $20.9 million, to $3,442.1 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	This increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $39 million in Canada and Latin America, reflecting a better-than-expected holiday selling season, new points of distribution and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P123_S2	In the United States, net sales increases of Clinique skin care products, various designer fragrances and from our makeup artist brands were partially offset by lower sales of various Est e Lauder fragrances and from our hair care brands.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P123_S3	Together with the impact of the exit from the global wholesale distribution of the Prescriptives brand, all of these factors resulted in lower net sales in the United States of approximately $10 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Despite restocking to more normal levels by certain retailers, economic conditions in the Americas region, particularly in the department store channel, have negatively impacted our business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	To address these concerns, we introduced new High-Touch concepts and worked with retailers in the channel to improve consumer traffic.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in the Americas were flat as compared with fiscal 2009.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, net sales increased 9%, or $248.0 million, to $2,859.3 million, reflecting growth from travel retail and from virtually all countries in the region and in each product category.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P126_S1	This reflects our strategy to strengthen our geographic presence and to succeed in the travel retail channel.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P126_S2	The region also benefited from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P126_S3	Net sales increases of approximately $250 million were driven by our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, Russia, South Africa, Germany and Turkey, reflecting an improved retail environment, successful launches of skin care products and higher combined sales from our makeup artist brands.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P126_S4	The net sales improvement in our travel retail business also reflected a favorable comparison to fiscal 2009 due to an increase in global airline passenger traffic, new points of distribution, select customer restocking and benefits of programs designed to enhance the consumer s High-Touch experience.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P126_S5	Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of approximately $13 million in the Balkans, primarily reflecting the economic situation in Greece.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P126_S6	Net sales for fiscal 2010 reflected a charge of approximately $31 million related to our long-term perfumery strategy discussed above.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P126_S7	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East Africa increased 8%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 16%, or $210.7 million, to $1,510.1 million, reflecting growth from all countries in the region and each product category.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	This reflects our strategy to strengthen and expand our geographic presence in Asia, particularly in China.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P127_S2	The region also benefited from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P127_S3	Approximately $184 million of this increase was generated in China, Korea, Hong Kong, Australia and Taiwan primarily reflecting strong sales of skin care products.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P127_S4	Australia and Korea also benefited significantly from foreign currency translation.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	Our business in Japan continued to be challenged due to difficult economic conditions, as reported net sales increases were generated from the strengthening of the Japanese yen.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 10%.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 23.5% as compared with 25.7% in fiscal 2009.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	This improvement primarily reflected our efforts in connection with the Program, including favorable changes in the mix of our business of approximately 70 basis points, a decrease in obsolescence charges of approximately 60 basis points and favorable manufacturing variances of 40 basis points.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P130_S2	Also contributing to the improvement in cost of sales margin were the favorable comparison to fiscal 2009 when we recorded excess overhead costs that were not expected to be recovered of approximately 30 basis points, and the favorable effect of exchange rates and a decrease in the timing and level of promotional activities of approximately 10 basis points, each.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 66.4% as compared with 68.6% in fiscal 2009, and reflects the impact of the strong growth in net sales during fiscal 2010.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	This improvement primarily reflected lower selling, shipping, general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales of approximately 180 basis points due to various cost containment efforts implemented as part of the Program and a strategically focused approach to spending, lower charges associated with restructuring activities of 30 basis points, the favorable comparison to fiscal 2009 related to other intangible asset impairment charges of approximately 20 basis points and lower net losses from foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P131_S2	Partially offsetting these improvements were higher strategic investment spending of approximately 10 basis points and higher advertising, sampling and merchandising costs of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	Changes in advertising, sampling and merchandising spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	Operating income increased 89%, or $371.5 million, to $789.9 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P133_S1	Operating margin improved to 10.1% of net sales as compared with 5.7% in fiscal 2009, reflecting our strategy to drive out non-value-added costs and increase financial discipline.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P133_S2	This, along with relatively strong net sales growth, resulted in a higher gross margin and the decrease in our operating expense margin as previously discussed.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of total charges associated with restructuring activities of $84.7 million, or 1.1% of net sales, in fiscal 2010 and $91.7 million, or 1.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2009.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	We believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	All product categories benefited from initiatives we implemented as part of the Program including a more strategically focused approach to spending, as well as significant improvement in cost of sales from favorable product mix and enhanced inventory management.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	Skin care operating income increased 48%, or $140.2 million, to $434.3 million, primarily reflecting improved results from our heritage brands driven by increased net sales primarily from recently-launched products with higher margins.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P135_S2	While the fiscal 2010 skin care results reflected charges of approximately $11 million related to goodwill, other intangible asset and long-lived asset impairments, it was a favorable comparison to fiscal 2009 when we recorded similar charges of approximately $36 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P135_S3	Makeup operating income increased 49%, or $137.0 million, to $416.8 million, primarily reflecting improved results from certain of our heritage brands and from our makeup artist brands.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P135_S4	The operating results for the makeup category also reflected the majority of the impact of the charge related to the discontinuation of certain SKUs, as previously discussed, which reflects the anticipated returns, as well as the write-off of related inventory on hand of approximately $30 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P135_S5	Fragrance operating results improved over 100%, or $87.1 million, from a loss in fiscal 2009 to $26.3 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales of designer fragrances, a more strategically focused approach to spending reflecting our strategy to improve profitability, and a favorable comparison to fiscal 2009 when we recorded approximately $13 million of other intangible asset impairment charges.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P135_S6	Hair care operating results decreased over 100% or $7.3 million, to a loss of $6.2 million, primarily reflecting higher goodwill and other intangible asset impairments of approximately $27 million, partially offset by net sales growth outside the United States, the closing of certain underperforming retail stores in fiscal 2009 and savings generated from cost containment initiatives.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	Operating results in each of our geographic regions benefited from the initiatives we implemented as part of the Program and a more strategically focused approach to spending, as well as significant improvement in cost of sales from favorable product mix and enhanced inventory management, resulting in significant improvements in their operating income.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	Operating income in the Americas increased 40%, or $46.3 million, to $161.5 million, driven by the Program and a more measured approach to spending, particularly from our heritage brands and our makeup artist brands.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	The increase also reflected a favorable comparison to fiscal 2009 when we recorded an excess overhead charge and a charge related to the degradation of a certain retailer of approximately $27 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	The increase in profitability was partially offset by lower net sales from the exit of the wholesale distribution of Prescriptives products, higher charges for goodwill, other intangible asset and long-lived asset impairments, and the impact of the recent economic events in Venezuela, as previously discussed.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, operating income increased over 100%, or $271.1 million, to $500.8 million, reflecting improvements in travel retail and virtually all countries in the region.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P138_S1	Higher results from our travel retail business and in Spain, Russia, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany totaled approximately $243 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P138_S2	While the fiscal 2010 results reflected a charge of approximately $6 million related to other intangible asset impairment, it was a favorable comparison to fiscal 2009 when we recorded goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $25 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P138_S3	In addition, as previously discussed, we recorded a charge in fiscal 2010 related to our long-term perfumery strategy of approximately $34 million, combined.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 29%, or $47.1 million, to $212.3 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P139_S1	Virtually all countries in the region reported higher operating results, led by Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan, and Australia, which combined for approximately $39 million of the improvement.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	Net interest expense was $74.3 million as compared with $75.7 million in fiscal 2009.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates on borrowings.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P140_S2	This change was partially offset by lower interest income due to lower average investment rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed a cash tender offer for $130.0 million principal amount of our 2012 Senior Notes at a price of 108.500% of the principal amount and for $69.9 million principal amount of our 2013 Senior Notes at a tender price of 118.813% of the principal amount.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P141_S1	We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $27.3 million representing the tender premium of $24.2 million, the pro-rata write-off of $2.4 million of unamortized terminated interest rate swap, issuance costs and debt discount, and $0.7 million in tender offer costs associated with both series of notes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P142_S1	The effective rate differs from statutory rates primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P142_S2	Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	The effective rate for income taxes for fiscal 2010 was 29.9% as compared with 33.8% for fiscal 2009.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P143_S1	The decrease in the effective income tax rate of 390 basis points was primarily attributable to tax reserve adjustments including favorable tax settlements as well as lapses of statutes of limitations partially offset by a higher effective tax rate related to our foreign operations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. as compared with fiscal 2009 increased over 100%, or $259.9 million, to $478.3 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased over 100% from $1.10 to $2.38.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	The results in fiscal 2010 include the impact of total charges associated with restructuring activities of $55.9 million, after tax, or $.28 per diluted common share and interest expense on debt extinguishment of $17.5 million, after tax, or $.09 per diluted common share.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P145_S2	The results in fiscal 2009 include the impact of total charges associated with restructuring activities of $61.7 million, after tax, or $.31 per diluted common share.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P146_S1	At June 30, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,253.0 million compared with $1,120.7 million at June 30, 2010.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P146_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P146_S3	As of June 30, 2011, less than 25% of our total cash was insured by governmental agencies.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P146_S4	To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P147_S2	To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P148_S1	Our cash and cash equivalents balance at June 30, 2011 includes approximately $508 million of cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P148_S2	We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P149_S0	The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P149_S1	Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P150_S0	Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P150_S1	Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P150_S2	Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P151_S1	As of August 15, 2011, our commercial paper is rated A-1 by Standard Poor s and P-1 by Moody s and our long-term debt is rated A with a stable outlook by Standard Poor s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody s.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P152_S0	At June 30, 2011, our outstanding borrowings were as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	(1) Consists of $300.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $3.6 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P153_S1	(2) Consists of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.3 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P153_S2	(3) Consists of $300.0 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $0.3 million and a $41.8 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of outstanding interest rate swaps.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P153_S3	(4) Consists of $230.1 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $0.1 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P153_S4	(5) Consists of $120.0 million principal and a $0.6 million adjustment to reflect the remaining termination value of an interest rate swap that is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P153_S5	(6) As of June 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants, including limitations on indebtedness and liens, and expect continued compliance.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	We have a $750.0 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P154_S1	At June 30, 2011, there was no commercial paper outstanding.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P154_S2	We also have $205.4 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities, of which $10.6 million was used as of June 30, 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P154_S3	We do not anticipate difficulties in securing this form of working capital financing.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	In July 2011, we replaced our undrawn $750.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire on April 26, 2012 (the Prior Facility ), with a new $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on July 14, 2015 (the New Facility ).
1001250_11_ITEM7_P155_S1	The New Facility may be used to provide credit support for our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P155_S2	As with the Prior Facility, up to the equivalent of $250 million of the New Facility is available for multi-currency loans.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P155_S3	The interest rate on borrowings under the New Facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or % plus the Federal funds rate.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P155_S4	We incurred costs of approximately $1.2 million to establish the New Facility which will be amortized over the term of the facility.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P155_S5	The New Facility has an annual fee of $0.7 million, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P155_S6	The New Facility also contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $100.0 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	As of June 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all financial and other restrictive covenants relating to the Prior Facility, including limitations on indebtedness and liens, and expect continued compliance with similar restrictive covenants in the New Facility.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P156_S1	The financial covenant in the Prior Facility required an interest expense coverage ratio of greater than 3:1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P156_S2	There is no such covenant under the New Facility.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	The interest expense coverage ratio was defined in the Prior Facility as the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (which does not represent a measure of our operating results as defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) to Consolidated Interest Expense and was calculated as stipulated in the Prior Facility as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P158_S0	(1) In accordance with the Prior Facility, this period represents the four most recent quarters.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P158_S1	(2) Includes interest expense, net and interest expense on debt extinguishment.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P158_S2	(3) Excludes amortization of debt discount, and derivative and debt issuance costs as they are already included in interest expense, net.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P158_S3	(4) Includes goodwill and other intangible asset impairments and non-cash charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P158_S4	(5) As provided for in the Prior Facility.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P159_S0	We have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to $150.0 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in Europe.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P159_S1	The interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an all-in fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P159_S2	At June 30, 2011, no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P159_S3	Debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P160_S0	We have an overdraft borrowing agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which our subsidiary in Turkey may be credited to satisfy outstanding negative daily balances arising from its business operations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P160_S1	The total balance outstanding at any time shall not exceed 40.0 million Turkish lira ($24.6 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2011).
1001250_11_ITEM7_P160_S2	The interest rate applicable to each such credit shall be up to a maximum of 175 basis points per annum above the spot rate charged by the lender or the lender s floating call rate agreed to by us at each borrowing.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P160_S3	There were no debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P160_S4	The outstanding balance at June 30, 2011 ($8.2 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2011) is classified as short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P161_S0	We have a 1.5 billion Japanese yen ($18.7 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2011) revolving credit facility that expires on March 31, 2012.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P161_S1	The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility is based on TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate) plus .75% and the facility fees incurred on the undrawn balance is 25 basis points.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P161_S2	At June 30, 2011, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P162_S0	Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interest) decreased to 32% at June 30, 2011 from 39% at June 30, 2010, primarily as a result of the an increase in stockholders equity, driven by higher net earnings during fiscal 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P163_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,027.0 million, $956.7 million and $696.0 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P163_S1	Cash flows from operating activities increased in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting the increase in net earnings and the timing and level of accrued income taxes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P163_S2	This increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable balances due to timing of collections, as well as lower levels of accounts payable due to timing of payments and an increase in inventory in line with forecasted sales activity and to ensure acceptable levels of service.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P164_S0	The increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 primarily reflected higher net earnings, an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in accounts receivable.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P164_S1	This increase also reflected higher accrued employee compensation and advertising, merchandising and sampling, partially offset by higher cash paid in fiscal 2010 for restructuring and severance.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P164_S2	These changes were partially offset by the building of safety stock for the April 2010 implementation of SAP at our North American manufacturing plants, the fiscal 2009 impact of significant inventory reductions, and higher discretionary pension contributions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P164_S3	Approximately $60 million of the change in deferred income taxes was offset by a correlative change in noncurrent accrued income taxes, reflecting the balance sheet presentation of unrecognized tax benefits.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P165_S0	Net cash used for investing activities was $606.9 million, $281.4 million and $339.5 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P165_S1	The increase in cash flows used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2010 primarily reflected the July 2010 acquisition of Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, as well as higher cash payments for counters and computer hardware and software.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P165_S2	The decrease in investing cash outflows during fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 primarily reflected lower acquisition activity in fiscal 2010 as compared with the acquisitions of Applied Genetics Incorporated Dermatics and businesses engaged in the wholesale distribution and retail sale of Aveda products in fiscal 2009.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P165_S3	The change also reflected lower cash payments in fiscal 2010 related to counters and leasehold improvements.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P166_S0	Net cash used for financing activities was $313.1 million and $406.1 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, and net cash provided by financing activities was $125.8 million in fiscal 2009.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P166_S1	The decrease in net cash flows used for financing activities reflected a favorable comparison with fiscal 2010 which included the partial redemption of the 2012 and 2013 Senior Notes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P166_S2	This favorable comparison was offset by an increase in treasury stock purchases and an increase in the common stock dividends during fiscal 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P166_S3	Subsequent to June 30, 2011, we purchased approximately 2.8 million additional shares of Class A Common Stock for $280.1 million pursuant to our share repurchase program.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P167_S0	The change in net cash flows used for financing activities in fiscal 2010 as compared with net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by the fiscal 2009 net proceeds from the issuance of the 2013 Senior Notes and the fiscal 2010 partial redemption of the 2012 and 2013 Senior Notes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P167_S1	Also contributing to this change was an increase in treasury stock purchases and repayments related to Ojon promissory notes, partially offset by higher cash inflows from stock option exercises and the fiscal 2009 repayment of commercial paper borrowings.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P168_S0	On November 9, 2010, the Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.75 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, of which an aggregate of $148.0 million was paid on December 15, 2010 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 29, 2010.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P168_S1	The annual common stock dividend declared during fiscal 2010 was $.55 per share, of which an aggregate of $109.1 million was paid on December 16, 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2009.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P169_S0	Several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P169_S1	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P169_S2	Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ( ERISA ) and subsequent pension legislation, and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P170_S0	For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P170_S1	In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in Item 7.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P171_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P171_S1	The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P172_S0	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P172_S1	This strategy assisted in maintaining a funded ratio of more than 100% as of June 30, 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P172_S2	For fiscal 2011 and 2010, we met or exceeded all minimum contributions required by ERISA for the U.S. Qualified Plan.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P172_S3	Nevertheless, we made discretionary cash contributions totaling $35.6 million and $39.0 million to the U.S. Qualified Plan during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P172_S4	We made discretionary cash contributions to our post-retirement plan in the United States of $8.4 million and $6.0 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P172_S5	At this time, we do not expect to make cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement plan in the United States during fiscal 2012.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P172_S6	However, as we continue to monitor the performance of our plan assets, we may decide to make discretionary contributions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P173_S0	For fiscal 2011 and 2010, we made benefit payments under our non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of $8.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P173_S1	We expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2012 of approximately $10 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P173_S2	For fiscal 2011 and 2010, we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of $34.1 million and $68.2 million, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P173_S3	We expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2012 of approximately $16 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P174_S0	Certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn-out provisions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P174_S1	These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P174_S2	Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P175_S0	For additional contingencies refer to Item 3.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P176_S0	The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of June 30, 2011:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P177_S0	(1) Includes long-term and short-term debt and the related projected interest costs, and to a lesser extent, capital lease commitments.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P177_S1	Interest costs on long-term and short-term debt are projected to be $71.5 million in fiscal 2012, $64.3 million in fiscal 2013, $55.1 million in fiscal 2014, $46.2 million in fiscal 2015, $46.2 million in fiscal 2016 and $595.9 million thereafter.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P178_S0	Projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P179_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 Debt .
1001250_11_ITEM7_P179_S1	(2) Minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P180_S0	Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, as well as common area maintenance.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P180_S1	These amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P180_S2	(3) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments, estimated future earn-out payments, estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements, advertising commitments, capital improvement commitments, planned funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements, obligations related to our cost savings initiatives and acquisitions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P180_S3	Future earn-out payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2011, without consideration for potential renewal periods.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P181_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Income Taxes for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P181_S1	As of June 30, 2011, the noncurrent portion of our unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties was $129.5 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P181_S2	At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P182_S0	We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P182_S1	We enter into foreign currency forward and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P182_S2	We also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P182_S3	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P182_S4	Costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to our consolidated financial results.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P183_S0	For each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P184_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P184_S1	We also formally assess, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P184_S2	If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P185_S0	We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with our identified exposures.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P185_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P186_S0	The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P186_S1	We may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P186_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of March 2013.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P186_S3	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P186_S4	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P186_S5	The ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P186_S6	For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P186_S7	If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to current-period earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P186_S8	As of June 30, 2011, these foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective in all material respects.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P187_S0	At June 30, 2011, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,490.7 million.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P187_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Swiss franc ($284.9 million), British pound ($273.5 million), Canadian dollar ($210.1 million), Euro ($164.6 million), Australian dollar ($110.7 million), Korean won ($77.9 million) and Russian ruble ($45.2 million).
1001250_11_ITEM7_P188_S0	We enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the identified exposures.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P188_S1	During fiscal 2011, we terminated our interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $250.0 million which had effectively converted the fixed rate interest on our outstanding 2017 Senior Notes to variable interest rates.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P188_S2	The instrument, which was classified as an asset, had a fair value of $47.4 million at the date of cash settlement.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P188_S3	Hedge accounting treatment was discontinued prospectively and the fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt is being amortized against interest expense over the remaining life of the debt.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P189_S0	As a matter of policy, we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that have at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P189_S1	The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P189_S2	Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $15.0 million at June 30, 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P189_S3	To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored and reported to management.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P189_S4	Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P190_S0	Certain of our derivative financial instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P190_S1	As of June 30, 2011, we were in a net liability position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features with two counterparties.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P190_S2	The fair value of those contracts as of June 30, 2011 was approximately $3.4 million and we were in compliance with such credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P191_S0	We use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P191_S1	Value-at-risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P191_S2	We estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250-day period.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P191_S3	The high, low and average measured value-at-risk during fiscal 2011 related to our foreign exchange contracts is as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P192_S0	The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P193_S0	We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P193_S1	Our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P193_S2	It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P194_S0	We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
1001250_11_ITEM7_P195_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

1001250_11_ITEM7_P197_S4	Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation:
1001250_11_ITEM7_P198_S0	(18) additional factors as described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P8_S0	Management of The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. (including its subsidiaries) (the Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P11_S0	Under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	Based on this assessment, the Company s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2011, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2011 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under the heading Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P14_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P14_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P15_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P15_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P16_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P17_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	In our opinion, The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, income taxes and derivatives.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P42_S2	Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average rates of exchange for the period.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	Unrealized translation gains or losses are reported as cumulative translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P43_S2	Such adjustments, attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc., amounted to $210.5 million of unrealized translation gains, net of tax, in fiscal 2011 and $65.9 million and $139.1 million of unrealized translation losses, net of tax, in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	For the Company s Venezuelan subsidiary operating in a highly inflationary economy, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	Remeasurement adjustments in financial statements in a highly inflationary economy and other transactional gains and losses are reflected in earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	Accordingly, the Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange losses on foreign currency transactions of $18.6 million, $33.3 million and $20.0 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P48_S1	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P48_S2	As of June 30, 2011, approximately 18% and 17% of the Company s cash and cash equivalents are held by two counterparties.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	Accounts receivable is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions totaling $33.9 million and $34.3 million as of June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	Inventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	Cost components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as inbound freight.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P51_S2	Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P51_S3	Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company s customers.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	Included in inventory and promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P52_S2	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P52_S3	In addition, and as necessary, specific reserves for future known or anticipated events may be established.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ( fair-value hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( foreign currency cash-flow hedge), or (iii) not designated as a hedging instrument.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P53_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge that is highly effective are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P53_S3	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a foreign currency cash-flow hedge of a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in OCI.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P53_S4	Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P53_S5	Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company s operating segments.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P60_S2	The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P60_S3	The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P60_S4	Impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) the Company determines impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, impairment is recorded.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	Testing goodwill for impairment requires the Company to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P63_S1	The assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company uses industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and, in certain instances, the Company engages third-party valuation specialists for advice.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P64_S1	To determine fair value of the reporting unit, the Company generally uses an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P64_S2	In certain circumstances, equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable (e.g., only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P64_S3	The Company believes both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P65_S1	Under the market approach, the Company utilizes information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, to value the reporting unit.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P65_S2	The key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	To determine fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company uses an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P66_S1	This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P66_S2	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P66_S3	Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P67_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P67_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	The Company s practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P72_S2	In accepting returns, the Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P81_S2	The remaining terms, including the potential renewal periods, range from approximately 1 year to 20 years.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	Most of the Company s licenses were entered into to create new business.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	In some cases, the Company acquired, or entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a pre-existing beauty products business.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P83_S2	In those cases, other intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P86_S2	Any resulting tax deficiencies will first be offset against those cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P86_S3	If the cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital are exhausted, tax deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P86_S4	Excess tax benefits are required to be reflected as financing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P87_S1	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P87_S2	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P87_S3	Based on the Company s assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P88_S0	If the Company determines that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P89_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P89_S2	The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P89_S4	For those tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	In certain circumstances, the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties which render them inestimable.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P91_S1	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P92_S0	In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance to eliminate the exception to consolidate a qualifying special-purpose entity, change the approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and require companies to more frequently re-assess whether they must consolidate variable interest entities.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P92_S1	Under the new guidance, the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is identified qualitatively as the enterprise that has both (i) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P92_S2	This guidance became effective for the Company s fiscal 2011 year end.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P92_S3	The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	In June 2011, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income, requiring entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	This guidance becomes effective for the Company s fiscal 2013 first quarter.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P93_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance but believes that it will result only in changes in the presentation of its financial statements and will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P94_S0	In May 2011, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements to provide a consistent definition and measurement of fair value, as well as similar disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P94_S1	This guidance clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and expands the existing disclosure requirements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P94_S2	This guidance becomes effective for the Company s fiscal 2012 third quarter.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P96_S0	In December 2010, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P96_S1	For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more-likely-than-not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P97_S0	In determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that a goodwill impairment exists, consideration should be made as to whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P97_S1	This guidance becomes effective for the Company s fiscal 2012 first quarter.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P97_S2	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	In December 2010, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to business combinations entered into by an entity that are material on an individual or aggregate basis.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P98_S1	These amendments clarify existing guidance that if an entity presents comparative financial statements that include a material business combination, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P98_S2	The amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P98_S3	This guidance becomes effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first day of the Company s fiscal 2012.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P98_S4	This disclosure-only guidance will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P99_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that will require entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements of assets and liabilities.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P99_S1	The Company adopted the new guidance in its fiscal 2010 third quarter, except for certain detailed recurring Level 3 disclosures, which are effective for the Company s fiscal 2012 first quarter.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P99_S2	The Company currently does not have any recurring Level 3 assets or liabilities.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P100_S0	The cost of assets related to projects in progress of $183.5 million and $160.4 million as of June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is included in their respective asset categories above.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	Other intangible assets include trademarks and patents, as well as license agreements and other intangible assets resulting from or related to businesses and assets purchased by the Company.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P104_S1	Indefinite-lived intangible assets (e.g., trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are assessed at least annually for impairment during the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P104_S2	Other intangible assets (e.g., non-compete agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately 5 years to 13 years.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P105_S0	Intangible assets related to license agreements were amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on the terms of the respective agreements.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	As of the Company s annual indefinite-lived asset impairment test on April 1, 2011, the Company determined, as a result of a planned discontinuation, that the carrying values of two brand trademarks exceeded their estimated fair values, which were based on the use of a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows ( relief-from-royalty method ).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P109_S1	As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $1.7 million for the carrying values of the related trademarks.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P109_S2	These impairment charges were reflected in the makeup and skin care product categories and in the Americas region.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Ojon reporting unit reassessed and subsequently altered the timing of new market initiatives, including the rollout of reformulated product lines and certain components of its future international expansion plans, resulting in revisions to its internal forecasts.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P110_S1	The Company concluded that these changes in circumstances in the Ojon reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark and goodwill.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P110_S2	Additionally, these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amount of the customer list may not be recoverable.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P110_S3	The Company performed an interim impairment test for the trademark and a recoverability test for the customer list as of February 28, 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P110_S4	For the customer list, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of this asset was recoverable.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P110_S7	After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed an interim impairment test for goodwill and recorded an impairment charge for the remaining goodwill related to the Ojon reporting unit of $29.3 million, at the exchange rate in effect at that time.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P110_S8	The fair value of the reporting unit was based upon the income approach, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P110_S9	In fiscal 2010, the income approach was used in conjunction with the market approach but due to the reporting unit s existing negative margins, the market approach was deemed not applicable.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P110_S10	These impairment charges were reflected in the hair care and skin care product categories and in the Americas region.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P111_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company approved a restructuring initiative that included the reformulation of Ojon brand products.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P113_S2	The Company determined that the trademark was impaired, with fair value estimated based upon the relief-from-royalty method, and therefore recorded an impairment charge of $5.8 million, at the exchange rate in effect at that time, in the skin care product category and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa region.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the Ojon reporting unit altered and delayed certain components of its future expansion plans, resulting in revisions to its internal forecasts.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P114_S1	The Company concluded for the Ojon trademark and customer list, that the carrying values exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined based upon the relief-from-royalty method for the trademark and discounted projected future cash flows for the customer list.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P116_S4	The restructuring charges are comprised of approximately $151.5 million to $153 million of employee-related costs, approximately $27 million of other exit costs and contract terminations (substantially all of which have resulted in or will result in cash expenditures), and approximately $20 million in non-cash asset write-offs.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P116_S5	The total amount of cumulative charges (pre-tax) associated with the Program recorded from inception through June 30, 2011 was $239.4 million.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	The Program focuses on a redesign of the Company s organizational structure in order to integrate it in a more cohesive way and operate more globally across brands and functions.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P118_S1	The principal aspect of the Program was the reduction of the workforce by approximately 2,000 employees.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P118_S2	Specific actions taken during fiscal 2011 and 2010 included:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	Resize and Reorganize the Organization The Company continued the realignment and optimization of its organization to better leverage scale, improve productivity, reduce complexity and achieve cost savings in each region and across various functions.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P119_S1	This included reduction of the workforce which occurred through the consolidation of certain functions, which the Company achieved through a combination of normal attrition and job eliminations, and the closure and consolidation of certain distribution and office facilities.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P120_S0	Turnaround or Exit Unprofitable Operations To improve the profitability in certain of the Company s brands and regions, the Company has selectively exited certain channels of distribution, categories and markets, and has made changes to turnaround others.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P120_S1	This included the exit from the global wholesale distribution of the Company s Prescriptives brand and the reformulation of Ojon brand products.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P120_S2	In connection with these activities, the Company incurred charges related to product returns, inventory write-offs, reduction of workforce and termination of contracts.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	Outsourcing In order to balance the growing need for information technology support with the Company s efforts to provide the most efficient and cost effective solutions, the Company continued the outsourcing of certain information technology processes.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P121_S1	The Company incurred costs to transition services to outsource providers and employee-related costs.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	The following table presents aggregate restructuring charges related to the Program:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	The following table presents accrued restructuring charges and the related activity under the Program:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	Accrued restructuring charges at June 30, 2011 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately $29 million, $6 million and $2 million in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	The following table presents total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities related to the Program:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	During fiscal 2011, the Company recorded $4.6 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $1.2 million) and a write-off of inventory of $7.0 million associated with turnaround operations, primarily related to the reformulation of Ojon brand products.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	During fiscal 2010, the Company recorded $15.7 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $2.5 million) and $10.4 million for the write-off of inventory associated with exiting unprofitable operations, primarily related to the exit from the global wholesale distribution of the Prescriptives brand.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded $8.1 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $1.2 million) and a write-off of inventory of $8.0 million associated with exiting unprofitable operations.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P130_S0	Other special charges in connection with the implementation of actions taken under this Program primarily relate to consulting and other professional services.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	The provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our actual effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes is as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	Income tax reserve adjustments represent changes in the Company s net liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to prior-year tax positions including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	Federal income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $1,208 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P135_S1	The Company intends to reinvest these earnings in its foreign operations indefinitely, except where it is able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P135_S2	As of June 30, 2010 and 2009, the Company had not provided federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $1,068 million and $975 million, respectively, of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P136_S0	The determination and estimation of the future income tax consequences in all relevant taxing jurisdictions involves the application of highly complex tax laws in the countries involved, particularly in the United States, and is based on the tax profile of the Company in the year of earnings repatriation.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P136_S1	Accordingly, it is not practicable to determine the amount of tax associated with such undistributed earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P137_S0	Significant components of the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P138_S0	As of June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had current net deferred tax assets of $260.7 million and $269.0 million, respectively, substantially all of which are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P138_S1	In addition, the Company had noncurrent net deferred tax assets of $61.1 million and $104.8 million as of June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, substantially all of which are included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	As of June 30, 2011 and 2010, certain subsidiaries had net operating loss and other carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately $216 million and $154 million, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P139_S1	With the exception of approximately $205 million of net operating loss and other carryforwards with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 30, 2011, these carryforwards expire at various dates through fiscal 2031.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P139_S2	Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, in the amount of $0.4 million and $3.9 million as of June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, have been recorded to reflect the tax benefits of the carryforwards not utilized to date.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	A full valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	Earnings before income taxes include amounts contributed by the Company s foreign operations of approximately $1,189 million, $966 million and $674 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P141_S1	A portion of these earnings are taxed in the United States.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	As of June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $104.8 million and $157.3 million, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P142_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $60.8 million.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P144_S1	During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized gross interest and penalty benefits of $1.0 million and $11.9 million, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P144_S2	The total gross accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2011 and 2010 were $37.7 million and $43.6 million, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P144_S3	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	Included in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2011 are $11.3 million of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P145_S1	Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	Earnings from the Company s global operations are subject to tax in various jurisdictions both within and outside the United States.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P146_S1	The Company is routinely audited and examined in these jurisdictions.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	The Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign unrecognized tax benefits for periods subject to audit.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P147_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P147_S2	The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P147_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P147_S4	For those tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P147_S5	Where applicable, associated interest and penalties have also been recognized.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P147_S6	Although the outcome related to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	In certain circumstances, the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involve significant uncertainties which render them inestimable.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P148_S1	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P149_S0	The Company is currently undergoing an income tax audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ) as well as examinations and controversies in several state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P149_S1	These matters are in various stages of completion and involve complex multi-jurisdictional issues common among multinational enterprises, including transfer pricing, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P150_S0	During fiscal 2008, the Company entered a claim pursuant to an administrative process of the tax treaty between the U.S. and Belgium (commonly referred to as the Competent Authority process).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P150_S1	In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company s Competent Authority claim was settled.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P150_S2	The settlement did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P151_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reached a formal agreement with the IRS concerning the examination adjustments proposed for fiscal 2006 through 2008.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P151_S1	As a result, the Company applied a prior cash payment of $20.5 million made to the U.S. Treasury as an advance deposit toward these agreed-to adjustments.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P151_S2	As a result of the settlement, the Company recognized a tax and interest benefit of $11 million, net of tax.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P151_S3	Separately, during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2011, the IRS commenced its examination of fiscal 2009 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P152_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P153_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company accepted an invitation from the IRS to join the Compliance Assurance Program ( CAP ) beginning with fiscal 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P153_S1	The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of income tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P153_S2	During fiscal 2011, the Company commenced participation in the CAP program with respect to fiscal 2011 and, as of June 30, 2011, the compliance process was ongoing.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P154_S0	The Company had been notified of a disallowance of tax deductions claimed by its subsidiary in Spain for fiscal years 1999 through 2002.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P154_S1	An appeal against this reassessment was filed with the Chief Tax Inspector.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P154_S2	On July 18, 2005, the final assessment made by the Chief Tax Inspector was received, confirming the reassessment made by the tax auditors.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P155_S0	During fiscal 2006, an appeal against this final assessment was filed with the Madrid Regional Economic Administrative Tribunal ( TEAR ).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P155_S1	In view of the TEAR s silence, during fiscal 2007 the claim was presumed to be dismissed and an appeal was filed against it with the Central Economic-Administrative Tribunal ( TEAC ).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P155_S2	During the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter, the TEAC dismissed the claim and, on June 10, 2008, the Company filed an appeal for judicial review with the National Appellate Court.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P155_S3	During fiscal 2009, the Company completed the appeal proceedings with the National Appellate Court and, as of June 30, 2011, awaited the court s decision.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P155_S4	Subsequent to June 30, 2011, the National Appellate Court notified the Company that the appeal was denied.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P156_S0	The Company has been assessed corporate income tax and interest of $4.0 million, net of tax, at current exchange rates.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P157_S0	On July 21, 2011, the Company filed an appeal with the Spain Supreme Court.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P157_S1	While no assurance can be given as to the outcome in respect of this assessment and pending appeal in the Spanish courts, based on the decision of the National Appellate Court, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the subsidiary will be successful in its appeal to the Spain Supreme Court.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P157_S2	Accordingly, the Company expects to establish a reserve during the first quarter of fiscal 2012 which would result in an increase to the provision for income tax equal to the $4.0 million exposure, net of tax.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P158_S0	Notwithstanding the matter before the Spanish courts, during the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reached a formal settlement with the Spanish tax authority regarding an examination of the fiscal 2005 through calendar year 2007 tax period.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P158_S1	The settlement did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P159_S0	During fiscal 2011, the Company concluded various state, local and foreign income tax audits and examinations while several other matters, including those noted above, were initiated or remained pending.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P159_S1	On the basis of the information available in this regard as of June 30, 2011, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in a range of $15 million to $25 million within 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of global tax examinations and controversies and a potential lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P160_S0	The tax years subject to examination vary depending on the tax jurisdiction.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P160_S1	As of June 30, 2011, the following tax years remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions indicated:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P161_S0	The Company is also subject to income tax examinations in numerous other state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P161_S1	The Company believes that its tax reserves are adequate for all years subject to examination.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P174_S2	The interest rate applicable to each such credit shall be up to a maximum of 175 basis points per annum above the spot rate charged by the lender or the lender s floating call rate agreed to by the Company at each borrowing.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P174_S3	There were no debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P174_S4	The outstanding balance at June 30, 2011 ($8.2 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2011) is classified as short-term debt on the Company s consolidated balance sheet.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P177_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P178_S0	In July 2011, the Company replaced its undrawn $750.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire on April 26, 2012 (the Prior Facility ), with a new $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on July 14, 2015 (the New Facility ).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P178_S1	The New Facility may be used to provide credit support for the Company s commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P178_S2	As with the Prior Facility, up to the equivalent of $250 million of the New Facility is available for multi-currency loans.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P178_S3	The interest rate on borrowings under the New Facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or % plus the Federal funds rate.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P178_S4	The Company incurred costs of approximately $1.2 million to establish the New Facility which will be amortized over the term of the facility.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P178_S5	The New Facility has an annual fee of $0.7 million, payable quarterly, based on the Company s current credit ratings.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P178_S6	The New Facility also contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $100.0 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P178_S7	There are no other conditions where the lender s commitments may be withdrawn, other than certain events of default, as defined in the New Facility, which are customary for facilities of this type.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P178_S8	As of June 30, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all financial and other restrictive covenants relating to the Prior Facility, including limitations on indebtedness and liens.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P178_S9	The financial covenant of the Prior Facility required an interest expense coverage ratio of greater than 3:1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P178_S10	There is no such covenant under the New Facility.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P179_S0	The Company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P179_S1	Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P179_S2	During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the monthly average amount outstanding was approximately $16.3 million and $12.6 million, respectively, and the annualized monthly weighted average interest rate incurred was approximately 8.8% and 10.0%, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P180_S0	Refer to Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies for the Company s projected debt service payments over the next five fiscal years.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P181_S0	The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P181_S1	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company s aggregate liability portfolio.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P181_S2	The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P181_S3	The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P181_S4	Costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company s consolidated financial results.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P182_S0	For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P183_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P183_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P183_S2	If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P184_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P185_S0	The fair values of the Company s derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets are presented as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P186_S0	(1) See Note 12 Fair Value Measurements for further information about how the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities are determined.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P187_S0	The amounts of the gains and losses related to the Company s derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are presented as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P188_S0	(2) The amount of gain (loss) recognized in earnings related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing was $0.3 million and $(2.5) million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P188_S1	The loss recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationships was $0.5 million for fiscal 2011.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P188_S2	There was no gain (loss) recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationships for fiscal 2010.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P190_S0	Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P191_S0	(1) Changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P192_S0	The amounts of the gains and losses related to the Company s derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments are presented as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P193_S0	Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P194_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P194_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P195_S0	The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P195_S1	The Company may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P195_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of March 2013.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P195_S3	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P196_S0	The ineffective portion of foreign currency forward contracts is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P196_S1	For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P196_S2	If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in accumulated OCI are reclassified to current-period earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P197_S0	As of June 30, 2011, the Company s foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective in all material respects.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P197_S1	The estimated net loss as of June 30, 2011 that is expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $8.2 million.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P197_S2	The accumulated gain (loss) on derivative instruments in accumulated OCI was $(13.2) million and $9.7 million as of June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, respectively.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P198_S0	At June 30, 2011, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,490.7 million.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P198_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Swiss franc ($284.9 million), British pound ($273.5 million), Canadian dollar ($210.1 million), Euro ($164.6 million), Australian dollar ($110.7 million), Korean won ($77.9 million) and Russian ruble ($45.2 million).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P199_S0	At June 30, 2010, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,348.8 million.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P199_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Swiss franc ($257.5 million), British pound ($241.9 million), Canadian dollar ($152.2 million), Euro ($148.0 million), Hong Kong dollar ($97.3 million), Australian dollar ($88.3 million) and Japanese yen ($62.3 million).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P200_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P201_S0	The Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the identified exposures.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P201_S1	At June 30, 2010, the Company had interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $250 million, a weighted average pay rate of 0.96% and a weighted average receive rate of 5.55%.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P201_S2	During fiscal 2011, the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreements which had effectively converted the fixed rate interest on its outstanding 2017 Senior Notes to variable interest rates.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P201_S3	Additionally, the instrument, which was classified as an asset, had a fair value of $47.4 million at the date of cash settlement.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P201_S4	This net settlement is classified as a financing activity on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P201_S5	Hedge accounting treatment was discontinued prospectively and the fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt is being amortized against interest expense over the remaining life of the debt.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P202_S0	As a matter of policy, the Company only enters into derivative contracts with counterparties that have at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P202_S1	The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P202_S2	Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $15.0 million at June 30, 2011, of which 30% and 23% were attributable to two counterparties.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P202_S3	To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored and reported to management.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P202_S4	Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P203_S0	Certain of the Company s derivative financial instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P203_S1	At June 30, 2011, the Company was in a net liability position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features with two counterparties.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P203_S2	The fair value of those contracts as of June 30, 2011 was approximately $3.4 million.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P203_S3	Such credit-risk-related contingent features would be triggered if (a) upon a merger involving the Company, the ratings of the surviving entity were materially weaker than prior to the merger or (b) the Company s credit ratings fall below investment grade (rated below BBB-/Baa3) and the Company fails to enter into an International Swaps Derivatives Association Credit Support Annex within 30 days of being requested by the counterparty.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P204_S0	The fair value of collateral required or assets required to settle the instruments immediately if a triggering event were to occur is estimated at approximately the fair value of the contracts.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P204_S1	As of June 30, 2011, the Company was in compliance with such credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P205_S0	The Company records its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P205_S1	The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations, goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment, and liabilities associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P206_S0	The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P206_S1	The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P207_S0	Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P208_S0	Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P209_S0	Level 3: Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P209_S1	The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument s valuation.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P211_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2011:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P212_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2010:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P213_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy and impairment charges for certain of its nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2011:

1001250_11_ITEM15_P217_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P218_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company s other classes of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P219_S0	The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P220_S0	Available-for-sale securities Available-for-sale securities are generally comprised of mutual funds and are valued using quoted market prices on an active exchange.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P220_S1	Available-for-sale securities are included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P221_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P221_S1	The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P221_S2	To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to 12 months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than 12 months.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P222_S0	Interest rate swap contracts The fair values of the Company s interest rate swap contracts were determined using the market approach and were based on non-binding offers from the counterparties that are corroborated by observable market data using the income approach.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P222_S1	The non-binding offers represented the prices offered by the counterparties in the over-the-counter market to unwind and terminate these instruments (exclusive of accrued interest) and incorporated the counterparties respective overall credit exposure to the Company.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P222_S2	The Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis to corroborate the fair values of the non-binding offers using inputs such as swap yield curves and six-month LIBOR forward rates, which were obtained from an independent pricing service.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P222_S3	During fiscal 2011, the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreements.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P222_S4	See Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P223_S0	Current and long-term debt The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P223_S1	To a lesser extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P224_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P225_S0	The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P225_S1	Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P225_S2	In certain instances, the Company adjusts benefits in connection with international employee transfers.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P226_S0	The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P226_S1	The Company s funding policy consists of contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P226_S2	Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ( ERISA ) and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P227_S0	The Company also has an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P228_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P229_S0	The Company maintains international pension plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P229_S1	The Company s funding policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P229_S2	The Company s most significant defined benefit pension obligations are included in the plan summaries below.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P230_S0	The fiscal 2011 international plan summary reflects a plan amendment and settlement that was a result of the establishment of a successor defined benefit pension plan, to comply with local regulations, for the employees of a particular international affiliate.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P231_S0	The Company maintains a domestic post-retirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P231_S1	Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they retire.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P231_S2	Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P231_S3	Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the retiree.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P231_S4	It is the Company s practice to fund these benefits as incurred and to provide discretionary funding for the future liability up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P232_S0	Certain of the Company s international subsidiaries and affiliates have post-retirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P233_S0	The significant components of the above mentioned plans as of and for the years ended June 30 are summarized as follows:
1001250_11_ITEM15_P234_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P235_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P236_S0	The discount rate for the Company s U.S. plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P236_S1	The Company believes the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of its U.S. plans.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P254_S0	The fair values are determined using NAV provided by the administrator of the fund.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P254_S1	The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the trust/entity, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P254_S2	When quoted in an active market, these investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P254_S3	When the market is not active, these investments are generally classified within Level 2.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P254_S4	When the market is not active and some inputs are unobservable, these investments are generally classified within Level 3.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P255_S0	Insurance contracts - These instruments are issued by insurance companies.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P255_S1	The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying investment held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P255_S2	The underlying investments are government, asset-backed and fixed income securities.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P256_S0	Insurance contracts are generally classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor other observable inputs for pricing.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P257_S0	Interests in limited partnerships and hedge fund investments - One limited partnership investment and one hedge fund was valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the partnership/fund.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P257_S1	The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the partnership/fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P257_S2	These investments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P257_S3	All other limited partnership investments and hedge fund investments are private equity funds and the fair values are determined by the fund managers based on the estimated value of the various holdings of the fund portfolio.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P298_S1	Such MSU will be settled based upon the average closing stock price per share of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the 20 trading days ending June 30, 2014 ( Average Price ).
1001250_11_ITEM15_P298_S2	No settlement will occur if the Average Price is below a minimum threshold, and up to 160,000 shares will be issued depending on the extent to which the Average Price equals or exceeds that minimum threshold.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P298_S3	The MSU is accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the MSU.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P299_S0	The grant date fair value of the MSU of $10.6 million was estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions: contractual life of 41 months, a weighted average expected volatility of 29%, a weighted average risk-free interest rate of 1.6% and a weighted average dividend yield of 1.0%.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P314_S0	Reportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Chief Executive ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P314_S1	As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P315_S0	Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P316_S0	While the Company s results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P316_S1	Accordingly, net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P316_S2	These product categories meet the definition of operating segments and, accordingly, additional financial data are provided below.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P317_S0	The other segment includes the sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.

1001250_11_ITEM15_P318_S1	Returns and charges associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to the product categories because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide program to redesign the Company s organizational structure.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P318_S2	The accounting policies for the Company s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales.
1001250_11_ITEM15_P318_S3	The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.

1001250_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	The Origins, Aveda and M A C brands are the primary focus for this method of distribution.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	At this time, we operate approximately 670 single-brand stores worldwide, the majority of which are in the United States, and expect that number to increase moderately over the next several years.

1001250_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our strategy is to build strong relationships with selected retailers globally.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	Senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis and we believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our largest customer, Macy s Inc., sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for 11% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 and 10% of our accounts receivable as of June 30, 2012 and 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our marketing strategy is built around Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	Mrs. Est e Lauder formulated this marketing philosophy to provide High-Touch service and high quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	Our marketing efforts focus principally on promoting the quality, value and benefits of our products.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P53_S3	Each of our brands is distinctively positioned, has a single global image, and is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P53_S4	We regularly advertise our products on television, in upscale magazines and newspapers, online, on billboards and through direct mail and photo displays at international airports.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P53_S5	In addition, our products receive extensive editorial coverage in prestige publications and other media worldwide.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Promotional activities and in-store displays are designed to attract new consumers and introduce existing consumers to different products in the line.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as purchase with purchase and gift with purchase.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	Such activities attract consumers to our counters and allow us to introduce them to our products.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P54_S3	Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and key retailers and consulting with demonstrators at the points of sale.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P54_S4	These include Est e Lauder Beauty Advisors, Clinique Consultants, Aramis Selling Specialists, Origins Guides and M A C and Bobbi Brown Makeup Artists.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	At in-store counters, demonstrators offer consumers a High-Touch experience with personal demonstrations to market individual products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and makeup application.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	We conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	We believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our High-Touch approach promotes the total value we offer, by leveraging our in-person and virtual assets, as well as merchandising and education, to provide a customized consumer experience.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	To support this initiative, we are expanding our efforts to evolve our e-commerce-based online strategy into a multi-pronged digital strategy encompassing e-commerce, m-commerce, as well as digital and social media.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	We have dedicated resources to implement coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P57_S3	We use the Internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P57_S4	Currently, 18 of our brands have marketing sites, 15 of which have e-commerce capabilities.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P57_S5	In order to continue to offer unparalleled customer service and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online, we partner with key brick and mortar retailers to strengthen their e-commerce business and drive sales of our brands on their websites, continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), and support e-commerce and m-commerce business via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house creative teams.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	The creative staff designs and produces the sales materials, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development costs were $2,655.7 million, $2,345.8 million and $2,015.9 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	These amounts include activities relating to purchase with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in cost of sales.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Information systems support business processes including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	We expect that these systems will continue to provide pertinent inventory and sales data in the short term.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	However, as part of our long-term effort to enhance these systems and increase productivity, we are implementing our Strategic Modernization Initiative ( SMI ), which includes an enterprise-wide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands, operating units and sales locations.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P60_S3	As part of SMI, we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to SAP-based technologies ( SAP ) with the majority of our locations being enabled through 2014.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	In parallel with our SAP deployment, we are creating a more focused global information technology organization utilizing industry standard processes.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	We are also taking this opportunity to rebalance our information technology resources to better align with our global business growth.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	We plan to continue to explore opportunities to create a more efficient organization.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	Of the many systems currently being utilized, the most significant to our business needs are: (i) a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer, or plan to offer, which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality; (ii) a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit ( SKU ) level at most significant retail sales locations (i.e. sell-through data), increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development, manufacturing and marketing strategies; (iii) an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers, allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically, with minimal paperwork; and (iv) an inventory management system that provides us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to forecasted requirements.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	As we continue to modernize our key processes and the related systems and infrastructure, we are developing upgraded capabilities to support our human resource and retail operations.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P62_S2	The plan is to progressively develop and deploy key systems globally over the next several years as appropriate according to local requirements and priorities.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	Marketing, product development and packaging groups work with our research and development group to identify shifts in consumer preferences, develop new products and improve, redesign or reformulate existing products.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	In addition, research and development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis to provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	The research and development group has long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	Members of the group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	We do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, nor ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	We evaluate our finished products in clinical tests on volunteer panels.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	As of June 30, 2012, we had approximately 500 employees engaged in research and development.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	Research and development costs totaled $96.5 million, $85.7 million and $79.5 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P66_S3	We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see Item 2.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	We manufacture our products primarily in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies and reduce costs.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P67_S2	Our major manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily manufacture one type of product (e.g., lipsticks) for all of the principal brands.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P67_S3	Our plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P67_S4	While we believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and productivity.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P67_S5	To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize third-party manufacturers on a global basis, including an increased percentage of volume in Asia/Pacific to support our growth.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	We are continuously evaluating and restructuring this physical distribution network.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P68_S2	We have continued to establish regional distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P69_S2	Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations department.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P69_S3	We are making a concentrated effort in supplier rationalization with the specific objective of reducing costs, increasing innovation and speed to market and improving quality.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P69_S4	In addition, we continue to focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P69_S5	As a result of sourcing initiatives, there is increased dependency on certain suppliers, but we believe that our portfolio of these suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	We are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will change suppliers, and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	The skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition throughout the world.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	Brand recognition, quality, performance and price have a significant impact on consumers choices among competing products and brands.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P72_S2	Advertising, promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store demonstrations also have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	With our numerous brands, sold in various channels, we are one of the world s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names.

1001250_12_ITEM1_P74_S3	Certain of our competitors also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	We own the trademark rights used in connection with the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of our products both in the United States and in the other principal countries where such products are sold, including Est e Lauder, Clinique, Aramis, Prescriptives, Lab Series, Origins, M A C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, American Beauty, Flirt!, GoodSkin Labs, grassroots research labs, Ojon, and Smashbox, and the names of many of the products sold under these brands.

1001250_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	We protect our trademarks in the United States and significant markets worldwide.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology in formulations or packaging.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P78_S1	In addition, several products are covered by design patents, patent applications or copyrights.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P78_S2	While we consider these patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is considered material to the conduct of our business.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	At June 30, 2012, we had approximately 38,500 full-time employees worldwide (including demonstrators at points of sale who are employed by us), of whom approximately 12,200 are employed in the United States and Canada.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	Included in the worldwide total this year were approximately 3,800 demonstrators outside the United States and Canada who are employed by us and whose employment costs are shared by retailers.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P79_S2	None of our employees in the United States is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P79_S3	In certain other countries, a limited number of employees are covered by a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	We believe that relations with our employees are good.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P80_S1	We have never encountered a material strike or work stoppage in the United States or in any other country where we have a significant number of employees.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P81_S1	Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, labeling, packaging, marketing, shipment and disposal of our products.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P81_S2	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable federal, state, local and international and other countries rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment or that relate to climate change.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	There are no significant capital expenditures for environmental control or climate change matters either planned in the current year or expected in the near future.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P83_S1	The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P83_S2	Many of our customers that are retailers follow a 4-4-5 retail calendar which may influence the amount and timing of their order placement and receipt of goods in any fiscal quarter.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	In a traditional 4-4-5 retail calendar, each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P84_S1	As a result, our customers retail quarter-end and our fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P85_S1	Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.
1001250_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	We make available financial information, news releases and other information on our website at www.elcompanies.com.

1001250_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading prices of our securities, may be adversely affected.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors actions in these areas.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Also, the consolidation in the retail trade has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers, including large-format retailers, who have increased their negotiating strength.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	This trend has also resulted in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	A severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P4_S7	In addition, certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We must continually work to develop, manufacture and market new products, maintain and adapt our High-Touch services to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The issue is compounded by the increasing use of social and digital media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our financial results will suffer.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Achieving our long-term strategy will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, technologies and geographic markets.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These investments may result in short-term costs without any current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings, at least in the short term.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If required, the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Acquisitions entail numerous risks, which may include:
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from, or customers of, acquired businesses; diversion of management s attention from our core businesses; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	A general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P16_S7	If a retailer was to liquidate, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer s inventory of our products to protect brand equity.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or local or international conflicts around the world, or as a result of a terrorist attack, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation, or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes or seismic events, can have a short and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Events that impact consumers willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling may impact our travel retail business, which is a significant contributor to our overall results.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A downturn or continuing recession in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect consumer confidence, the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We continue to see increased weakness due to global economic uncertainties and volatility in financial markets, particularly in certain Western European countries, Korea and Australia.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We are also cautious that macroeconomic factors may temper the future growth trend of the Chinese economy.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	While we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, laws and regulations relating to data privacy and anti-corruption, laws in Europe relating to selective distribution, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are involved, and may become involved in the future, in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that, if adversely decided or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, other disputes or regulatory proceedings.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In general, claims made by us or against us in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	As we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities about our business and compliance with local laws and regulations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers standards, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our key personnel.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Competition for these employees can be intense.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P31_S4	We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P31_S5	This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We are subject to risks related to our foreign operations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We operate on a global basis, with a majority of our fiscal 2012 net sales and operating income generated outside the United States.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely, except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	A portion of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the United States.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We maintain offices in over 40 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	adverse weather conditions, currency exchange controls, and social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	A disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our information systems and websites may be susceptible to outages, hacking and other risks.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We have information systems that support our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We have e-commerce, m-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	As part of SMI, we are implementing enterprise-wide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands, regions and functions.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We anticipate the continued migration of our operations to SAP, with the majority of our locations to be enabled through 2014.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Like most entity-wide changes to software systems, the implementation of SMI involves risks and uncertainties.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Failure to implement SMI as planned, in terms of timing, specifications and/or costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal 2012, we provided guidance as to a number of assumptions, including our expected net sales and earnings per share for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 and the quarter ending September 30, 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P47_S4	While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P47_S5	In addition, the longer-term guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our net sales and/or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q).
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P49_S3	If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P49_S5	We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information with respect to customers and employees.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Moreover, the success of our e-commerce and m-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees and customers personal information, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees and customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P51_S5	In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	As we outsource more functions, we will become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	As part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P53_S2	These include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations, and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We are controlled by the Lauder family.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	As a result of their control of us, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	As of August 13, 2012, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having 86.9% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In addition, there are four members of the Lauder family who are employees, including three who are members of our Board of Directors.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P56_S3	As a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the Company, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including, without limitation, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets, for the foreseeable future.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a controlled company under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	As a controlled company, we are exempt under the New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements: that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities; and that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P58_S2	While we have voluntarily caused our Board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and the Compensation Committee to have the required provisions, we are not requiring our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and Compensation Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors.
1001250_12_ITEM1A_P58_S3	As a result of our use of the controlled company exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.
1001250_12_ITEM1B_P0_S0	As of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, there were no unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1001250_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following table sets forth our principal owned and leased manufacturing, assembly, research and development and distribution facilities as of August 13, 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	The leases expire at various times through 2028 subject to certain renewal options.
1001250_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own, lease and occupy numerous offices, assembly and distribution facilities and warehouses in the United States and abroad.
1001250_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	We consider our properties to be generally in good condition and believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet anticipated requirements.
1001250_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	We lease approximately 595,000 square feet of rentable space for our principal offices in New York, New York and own an office building of approximately 57,000 square feet in Melville, New York.
1001250_12_ITEM2_P1_S3	As of August 13, 2012, we operated approximately 800 retail stores.
1001250_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business.
1001250_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	However, management s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.
1001250_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	Except as disclosed below, reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to our consolidated financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	During the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter, the former owner of the Darphin brand initiated litigation in the Paris Commercial Court against us seeking to recover 60.0 million ($75.5 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2012) that he claims he was owed as additional consideration for the sale of Darphin to us in April 2003.
1001250_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	On December 23, 2011, the Paris Commercial Court issued its judgment, awarding the former owner 22.9 million ($28.8 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2012) plus interest from 2007.
1001250_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	We have filed our appeal with the Paris Court of Appeal.
1001250_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	In accordance with the judgment, in January 2012, we paid 25.3 million ($31.8 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2012) to the former owner and received from him a bank guarantee to assure repayment to us of such sum (or any part thereof) in the event that the judgment is reversed by the Paris Court of Appeal.
1001250_12_ITEM3_P1_S4	Based upon our assessment of the case, as well as the advice of external counsel, we are maintaining the amount we previously accrued as an amount that we believe will ultimately be paid based on the probable outcome of the appeal.
1001250_12_ITEM3_P1_S5	Such amount is less than the Paris Commercial Court s award.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market for Registrant s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Our Class A Common Stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EL.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table shows the high and low per share sales prices as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011:
1001250_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	All share and cash dividends declared per common share information above reflects the two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on our Class A and Class B Common Stock on January 20, 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	We expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future, but there can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will continue to declare them.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	In November 2011, the Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $.525, which was paid in December 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	The 2011 annual dividend was declared in November 2010, and paid in December 2010 and amounted to $.375 per share.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of August 13, 2012, there were approximately 8,318 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 17 record holders of Class B Common Stock.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 176.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	As of June 30, 2012, the cumulative total of acquired shares pursuant to the authorization was 161.1 million, reducing the remaining authorized share repurchase balance to 14.9 million.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P4_S2	During fiscal 2012, we purchased approximately 11.2 million shares pursuant to the authorization for $555.2 million as outlined in the following table:
1001250_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	(1) The initial program covering the repurchase of 16.0 million shares was announced in September 1998 and increased by 40.0 million shares each in November 2007, February 2007 and May 2005 and 20.0 million shares in both May 2004 and October 2002.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P5_S1	(2) Includes shares that were repurchased by the Company in connection with shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations upon the settlement of performance share units.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P5_S2	(3) Includes shares that were repurchased by the Company in connection with shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock units.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P6_S0	All of the above share and per-share information is presented on a post-split basis.
1001250_12_ITEM5_P7_S0	Subsequent to June 30, 2012, we purchased approximately 2.0 million additional shares of Class A Common Stock for $104.2 million pursuant to our share repurchase program.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The table below summarizes selected financial information.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto beginning on page F-1 of this report.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Fiscal 2012 results included $44.1 million, after tax, or $.11 per diluted share related to charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P1_S1	Fiscal 2011 results included $41.7 million, after tax, or $.10 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P1_S2	Fiscal 2010 results included $55.9 million, after tax, or $.14 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P1_S3	Fiscal 2009 results included $61.7 million, after tax, or $.16 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	In November 2008, we issued and sold $300.0 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due November 1, 2013 in a public offering.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	We used the net proceeds of this offering to repay then-outstanding commercial paper balances upon their maturity.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	(c) On May 24, 2010, we completed a cash tender offer for $130.0 million principal amount of our 2012 Senior Notes at a price of 108.500% of the principal amount and for $69.9 million principal amount of our 2013 Senior Notes at a tender price of 118.813% of the principal amount.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P3_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $27.3 million representing the tender premium, the pro-rata write-off of unamortized terminated interest rate swap, issuance costs and debt discount, and tender offer costs associated with both series of notes.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	In November 2011, we settled a commercial dispute with third parties that was outside our normal operations.
1001250_12_ITEM6_P4_S1	In connection therewith, we received a $10.5 million cash payment, which has been classified as other income in our consolidated statement of earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2012 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, income taxes and derivatives.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at our retail stores.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	In accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.5% in fiscal 2012 and 2011 and 4.3% in fiscal 2010.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	The improvement from fiscal 2010 reflects efforts to work with our customers to improve their forecasting and product mix to better address their inventory requirements.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	This accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	Consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	Experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P5_S4	In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P5_S5	The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $31.1 million and $33.9 million as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by $13.8 million, $9.9 million and $15.8 million for customer deductions and write-offs in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and increased by $11.0 million, $9.5 million and $8.7 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Inventory We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	We believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead, as well as inbound freight.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P7_S4	Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P7_S5	Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Costs We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan ( U.S. Qualified Plan ) and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the Domestic Plans a domestic contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	The amounts needed to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	While we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	For fiscal 2012, we used a discount rate for our Domestic Plans of 5.40% and varying rates on our international plans of between 1.25% and 8.25%.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	The discount rate for our Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	We believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	For fiscal 2012, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of between 2.00% and 8.25% for our international plans.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 Pension, Deferred Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Plans for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	For fiscal 2012, our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $76 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $60 million, which resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately $16 million, substantially all of which is currently subject to be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 6 to 22 years.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	The actual return on plan assets was primarily related to the strong performance of the fixed income investments during the past fiscal year.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	A 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2012 pension expense:
1001250_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2012 would have had the following effects:
1001250_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	For fiscal 2013, we are using a discount rate for the Domestic Plans of 3.90% and varying rates for our international plans of between 1.00% and 7.00%.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	We are using an expected return on plan assets of 7.50% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 2.25% and 7.00%.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	The net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2012 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $19 million in fiscal 2013.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	We will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	We make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P18_S4	Impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge is recorded.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	The assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	We use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and, in certain instances, we engage third-party valuation specialists for advice.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	To determine fair value of the reporting unit, we generally use an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	In certain circumstances, equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable (e.g., only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins).
1001250_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	We believe both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Under the income approach, we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Under the market approach, we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, to value the reporting unit.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	The key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	The fiscal 2012 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections, as considered appropriate for the individual reporting units, ranged between 5% and 18% with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The fiscal 2011 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections ranged between 3% and 19% with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	For reporting units with positive earnings, growth in the corresponding earnings before interest and taxes ranged from 7% to 47% in fiscal 2012 as compared with 6% to 109% in fiscal 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	The terminal growth rates were projected at 3% after five to eight years in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	The weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from 8% to 16% in fiscal 2012 as compared with 7.5% to 16% in fiscal 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P24_S5	The range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2012 impairment testing was from 1.7 to 3.3 times trailing-twelve-month sales and 10.0 to 12.5 times trailing-twelve-month earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P24_S6	The range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2011 impairment testing was from 1.5 to 3 times trailing-twelve-month sales and between 11 to 12 times trailing-twelve-month earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P24_S7	Future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P24_S8	However, a decrease of 100 basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of 100 basis points in our weighted-average cost of capital would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units, except for the Darphin reporting unit, for which a decrease of 75 basis points in our terminal growth rate would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding its book value.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	To determine fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we use an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	The fiscal 2012 and 2011 terminal growth rate applied to future cash flows was 3% and the fiscal 2012 and 2011 discount rates ranged from 10% to 18%.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	The fiscal 2012 and 2011 royalty rates ranged from 0.5% to 12%.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	As of June 30, 2012, we have current net deferred tax assets of $247.8 million and non-current net deferred tax assets of $103.1 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of $73.2 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P29_S4	Based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	If we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P31_S4	For those tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	We classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Derivatives We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	We enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	Hedge effectiveness is documented, assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	Variables that are external to us such as social, political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	All derivatives outstanding as of June 30, 2012 are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ( fair-value hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( foreign currency cash-flow hedge), or (iii) not designated as a hedging instrument.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge that is highly effective are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments).
1001250_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a foreign currency cash-flow hedge of a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ).
1001250_12_ITEM7_P35_S4	Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).
1001250_12_ITEM7_P35_S5	Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	For a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments, see Item 7.

1001250_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Quantitative Analysis During the three-year period ended June 30, 2012 there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	The results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	For fiscal 2012, had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately $4.8 million, operating expenses would have changed by approximately $0.8 million and the provision for income taxes would have remained unchanged.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	The collective impact of these changes on operating income, net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc., and net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately $5.6 million, $5.6 million and $.01, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	The following table is a comparative summary of operating results from continuing operations for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Item 8.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 20 Segment Data and Related Information for all periods presented.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:
1001250_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	Therefore, we present certain net sales information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	We calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Overview We believe that the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers changing shopping habits.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	To be the global leader in prestige beauty, we continued to implement a long-term strategy that is guiding us through fiscal 2015.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	The strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands and functions that are designed to leverage our strengths, make us more productive and grow our sales.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	We believe we have a strong, diverse brand portfolio with global reach and potential, and we plan to continue building upon and leveraging our history of outstanding creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	We have succeeded in expanding our High-Touch service model and will continue to look for ways to expand it in newer channels and within geographic regions.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	As an example, we are developing capabilities to deliver superior retailing experiences, particularly in Company-operated retail stores.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	We are expanding our efforts to evolve our e-commerce-based online strategy into a multi-pronged digital strategy encompassing e-commerce, m-commerce, as well as digital and social media.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P48_S4	We are leveraging our regional organization in an effort to assure that we are locally relevant with our products, services, marketing and visual merchandising.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	As part of our strategy, we are continuing to shift our category mix towards higher margin categories with greater global growth potential.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	Skin care, our most profitable product category, is a strategic priority for our innovation and investment spending, particularly in the Asia/Pacific region.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	We also focused our attention on luxury consumers across all categories and have seen an improvement in the net sales of many of our higher-end prestige products, due to an improvement in the luxury retail environment.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	We will also continue to build our makeup category through the introduction of new product offerings, continue expanding our hair care brands both in the salon and in other retail channels and focus our efforts to strengthen our fragrance business model.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	We are strengthening our geographic presence by seeking share growth in large, image-building cities within core markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Japan.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	In addition, we continue to prioritize efforts to expand our presence and accelerate share growth in emerging markets such as China, Russia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Brazil and focus on these consumers who either buy in the travel retail channel, in stores at their destinations or when they return to their homes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	We continue to expand our digital presence, which has resulted in growth in net sales of our products sold online.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	In North America, we continue to recognize the need to drive profitable growth in our traditional department store channel and see many benefits from the changes we have previously implemented and continue to reshape our organization to meet the needs of the changing retail landscape.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P50_S4	At the same time, we are also expanding our presence in other channels, such as specialty retailers, Company-operated stores and online.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P50_S5	Internationally, we continue to take actions to grow profitability in European perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores in Asia, while emphasizing our skin care and makeup initiatives to boost our travel retail business and continuing efforts to grow our online, specialty retailer and prestige salon businesses.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	The travel retail business continues to be a source of sales growth and profitability.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	Our business in this channel is benefiting from the implementation of programs we designed to enhance consumers High-Touch experiences and convert travelers into purchasers.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	We plan to continue to invest in the significant modernization of our global information systems, which includes the Strategic Modernization Initiative ( SMI ) as well as other initiatives, and continue to shift our focus from gift with purchase activities to advertising, merchandising and sampling initiatives.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	These initiatives should over time enable overall profitability improvements by enhancing gross margin and supporting efficiencies in select operating expenses, while increasing our strategic investment spending.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Looking ahead to fiscal 2013, we plan to continue building on our strengths.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	We have a strong, diverse and highly valuable brand portfolio with global reach and potential, as well as a track record of outstanding creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship and healthy growth.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	We plan on continuing to bring highly innovative products to consumers and elevating our personalized High-Touch service model.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	We are dedicated to investing in select areas to improve our capabilities.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P53_S4	Our main focuses are digital, as it is becoming an integral part of our everyday business, research and development, product innovation, consumer insight and local relevance.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	While our overall business is performing well, we continue to see increased weakness due to ongoing global economic uncertainties and volatility in financial markets, particularly in certain Western European countries, Korea and Australia.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	We believe we have and will continue to offset to some extent the impact of these events as a result of our strategy to mitigate weaknesses we find in certain areas with strengths in others.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	However, if adverse economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or are further prolonged, then we expect there to be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence, demand and spending and, as a result, our business.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	We will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Returns and Charges Associated with Restructuring Activities In an effort to drive down costs and achieve synergies within our organization, in February 2009, we announced the implementation of a multi-faceted cost savings program (the Program ) to position the Company to achieve long-term profitable growth.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	We anticipate the Program will result in related restructuring and other charges, inclusive of cumulative charges recorded to date and through the remainder of the Program, totaling between $350 million and $450 million before taxes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	While we will continue to seek cost savings opportunities, our current plans are to identify and approve specific initiatives under the Program through calendar 2012 and execute those initiatives through fiscal 2013.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	The total amount of charges (pre-tax) associated with the Program recorded, plus other initiatives approved through June 30, 2012, is approximately $361 million to $366 million, of which approximately $251 million to $253 million relates to restructuring charges, approximately $50 million of other costs to implement the initiatives, approximately $42 million to $45 million in sales returns and approximately $18 million in inventory write-offs.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	The restructuring charges are comprised of approximately $188 million to $190 million of employee-related costs, approximately $40 million of other exit costs and contract terminations (substantially all of which have resulted in or will result in cash expenditures), and approximately $23 million in non-cash asset write-offs.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P55_S5	The total amount of cumulative charges (pre-tax) associated with the Program recorded from inception through June 30, 2012 was $302.6 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	We expect that the implementation of this Program, combined with other on-going cost savings efforts, will result in savings of approximately $760 million to $785 million (Program inception through the end of fiscal 2012 is approximately $710 million) including the reduction of certain costs relative to an assumed normalized spending pattern.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	Our long-range forecast for operating margin reflects these anticipated savings, net of strategic reinvestments.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Program focuses on a redesign of our organizational structure in order to integrate the Company in a more cohesive way and operate more globally across brands and functions.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	The principal aspect of the Program was the reduction of the workforce by approximately 2,000 employees.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	Specific actions taken since Program inception included:
1001250_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Resize and Reorganize the Organization We continued the realignment and optimization of our organization to better leverage scale, improve productivity, reduce complexity and achieve cost savings in each region and across various functions.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	This included reduction of the workforce which occurred through the consolidation of certain functions, which we achieved through a combination of normal attrition and job eliminations, and the closure and consolidation of certain distribution and office facilities.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Turnaround or Exit Unprofitable Operations To improve the profitability in certain of our brands and regions, we have selectively exited certain channels of distribution, categories and markets, and have made changes to turnaround others.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	This included the exit from the global wholesale distribution of our Prescriptives brand, the reformulation of Ojon brand products and the exit from the global distribution of Sean John products.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	In connection with these activities, we incurred charges for product returns, inventory write-offs, reduction of workforce and termination of contracts.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Outsourcing In order to balance the growing need for information technology support with our efforts to provide the most efficient and cost effective solutions, we continued the outsourcing of certain information technology processes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	We incurred costs to transition services to outsource providers and employee-related termination costs.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The following table presents aggregate restructuring charges related to the Program:
1001250_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	The following table presents accrued restructuring charges and the related activities under the Program:
1001250_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Accrued restructuring charges at June 30, 2012 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately $35 million, $12 million and $2 million in fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	The following table presents total charges associated with restructuring and other activities related to the Program:
1001250_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	During fiscal 2012, we recorded $2.1 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $0.3 million) and a write-off of inventory of $1.8 million associated with exiting unprofitable operations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	During fiscal 2011, we recorded $4.6 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $1.2 million) and a write-off of inventory of $7.0 million associated with turnaround operations, primarily related to the reformulation of Ojon brand products.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	During fiscal 2010, we recorded $15.7 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $2.5 million) and $10.4 million for the write-off of inventory associated with exiting unprofitable operations, primarily related to the exit from the global wholesale distribution of the Prescriptives brand.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairments During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Ojon reporting unit identified a potential decline in its projected results of operations, primarily resulting from a softness in the direct response television channel, which caused us to review and revise Ojon s long-term forecast.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	We concluded that these changes in the business of the Ojon reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment test of its trademarks as of December 31, 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amount of the customer list may not be recoverable.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P68_S3	We performed an interim impairment test for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the customer list as of December 31, 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P68_S4	For the trademarks, we concluded that the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the use of a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows ( relief-from-royalty method ).
1001250_12_ITEM7_P68_S5	As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $6.7 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P68_S6	This charge was reflected in the hair care product category and in the Americas region.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P68_S7	We concluded that the carrying value of the customer list was recoverable.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	As of our annual step-one goodwill impairment test on April 1, 2012, all reporting units fair values substantially exceeded their respective carrying values and the fair values of all other indefinite-lived intangible assets substantially exceeded their respective carrying values, except as noted below.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	We determined that the carrying value of the Ojon brand trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $3.3 million for the remaining carrying value of the related trademark.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P69_S3	We also determined that the future cash flows associated with the Ojon brand customer list were less than its carrying value.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P69_S4	As the remaining carrying value of the customer list is not recoverable, we recognized an impairment charge of $11.7 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P69_S5	These impairment charges were reflected in the hair care product category and in the Americas region.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Darphin reporting unit experienced an unanticipated deterioration in its results of operations due to softness in its European business, which is its primary market.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Based on a qualitative analysis, we reviewed and revised Darphin s long-term forecast.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	We concluded that these changes in circumstances triggered the need for an impairment test of the reporting unit s trademark and goodwill as of June 30, 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	We determined that the trademark was not impaired, with the estimated fair value exceeding the carrying value by less than 2%.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P71_S3	As of June 30, 2012, the carrying value of the trademark was $7.9 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P71_S4	The estimated fair value of the trademark was based upon the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P71_S5	The key assumptions that were used to determine the estimated fair value of the trademark were based on the expectation that the economic uncertainties in Europe would be temporary and not permanent in nature.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P71_S6	If the decline in this market is more severe than we have anticipated, or other business disruptions arise, a resulting change in the key assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of this trademark and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P71_S7	After completing the interim impairment test on the trademark, we completed step one of the impairment test for goodwill and concluded that the fair value of the Darphin reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value including goodwill.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Although our consolidated financial performance exceeded our expectations for fiscal 2012, we expect global economic conditions, uncertainties and volatility to impact our business.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	As the duration and magnitude of the volatility of the current economic conditions remain uncertain, we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on our business and on our annual impairment testing.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	Accordingly, it is possible that we would recognize an impairment charge in the future with respect to goodwill, other intangible assets and/or long-lived assets.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	NET SALES Net sales increased 10%, or $903.6 million, to $9,713.6 million, reflecting growth in all of our major product categories within each geographic region.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was de minimis.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	The following discussions of Net Sales by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of $2.1 million and $4.6 million recorded during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	We believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	In the fiscal 2012 third quarter, we established a provision for then-anticipated returns of approximately $16 million as a result of repositioning certain products due to changes in regulations related to sunscreen products in the United States.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	These regulations were subsequently deferred and, accordingly, we reversed this provision in the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P76_S3	As the identified products are expected to be sold in the ordinary course of business, we do not expect any significant financial impact due to these regulations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 14%, or $506.6 million, to $4,225.2 million, primarily reflecting the continued success of our strategic focus on growing this category.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	The recent launches of Turnaround Overnight Radiance Moisturizer, Moisture Surge Intense and Repairwear Uplifting Firming Cream from Clinique and Revitalizing Supreme Global Anti-Aging Creme from Est e Lauder contributed incremental sales of approximately $78 million, combined.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P77_S2	Higher sales of Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator, Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex and Idealist Cooling Eye Illuminator from Est e Lauder and various products from La Mer and Origins contributed approximately $237 million, combined, to the increase.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P77_S3	The relaunch of the reformulated Resilience Lift and Nutritious Vita-Mineral lines of products from Est e Lauder contributed incremental sales of approximately $187 million, combined.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P77_S4	This growth was partially offset by approximately $112 million of lower sales from the existing line of Resilience Lift Extreme products from Est e Lauder and Cyber White EX from Clinique.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P77_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 13%.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Makeup Makeup net sales increased 10%, or $326.0 million, to $3,696.8 million, primarily reflecting an increase in net sales from our makeup artist brands of approximately $218 million, combined.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	The recent launches of Repairwear Laser Focus All-Smooth Makeup and Lid Smoothie Antioxidant 8-Hour Eye Colour from Clinique and Doublewear Stay-In-Place Makeup from Est e Lauder contributed approximately $85 million, combined, to the increase.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	Higher sales of Even Better Makeup and Chubbystick Moisturizing Lip Colour balm from Clinique contributed approximately $41 million to the increase.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	This growth was partially offset by lower sales of Doublewear Powder Makeup and Doublewear Stay-in-Place Flawless Wear Concealer from Est e Lauder and Repairwear Anti-Aging Makeup from Clinique of approximately $34 million, combined.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	The impact of foreign currency translation on makeup net sales was de minimis.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products increased 3%, or $35.0 million, to $1,271.0 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	Incremental sales from the recent launches of Est e Lauder Sensuous Nude and DKNY Golden Delicious contributed approximately $58 million, combined, to the category.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	Higher sales from Jo Malone and Tom Ford fragrances contributed approximately $37 million to the increase.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P80_S3	Partially offsetting these increases were approximately $68 million, combined, of lower sales of DKNY Be Delicious, Est e Lauder Sensuous, pureDKNY and Est e Lauder pleasures bloom .
1001250_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	The impact of foreign currency translation on fragrance net sales was de minimis.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 7%, or $30.1 million, to $462.4 million, reflecting an increase in sales generated from expanded global distribution.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	The category also benefited from new launches including the Invati line of products from Aveda and Concen-Straight from Bumble and bumble.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of Ojon brand products due, in part, to softness in our business in the direct response television channel.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P82_S3	The impact of foreign currency translation on hair care net sales was de minimis.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Net sales in the Americas increased 8%, or $304.8 million, to $4,101.1 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	The increase during the current year was primarily attributable to growth in the United States of approximately $257 million, primarily due to new product offerings from our heritage and makeup artist brands, as well as an increase in sales of our higher-end prestige skin care products.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	These increases reflect, in part, our ongoing efforts to work with retailers in the U.S. department store channel on strengthening the High-Touch concepts used to help market our products.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	Net sales in Latin America increased approximately $30 million, primarily reflecting growth in Brazil and Chile.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P83_S4	Net sales in Canada increased approximately $19 million, primarily reflecting increased sales from our heritage and makeup artist brands.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in the Americas was de minimis.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, net sales increased 11%, or $345.6 million, to $3,603.2 million, due to growth in each major product category reflecting our strategy to strengthen our geographic presence and continue to succeed in the travel retail channel.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	Due to the economic uncertainties in Europe, our business in some countries experienced slower than anticipated net sales growth.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	Accordingly, we remain cautious in the near term.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P85_S3	Net sales increases of approximately $313 million were driven by our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, the Middle East, Germany and Italy.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P85_S4	The net sales improvement in our travel retail business reflected an increase in global airline passenger traffic, new points of distribution and benefits of programs designed to enhance consumers High-Touch experiences and convert travelers into purchasers.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P85_S5	The growth in the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy was primarily attributable to successful launches of skin care and makeup products from certain of our heritage brands, as well as higher combined sales from our makeup artist brands.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P85_S6	Net sales in the Middle East benefited from a new fragrance launch designed specifically for consumers there, in line with our strategy to be locally relevant.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P85_S7	These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in Russia, Spain and the Balkans of approximately $25 million, combined.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P85_S8	The lower net sales in Russia primarily reflected destocking associated with ongoing challenges with a certain customer.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P85_S9	Net sales in Spain and the Balkans declined primarily due to difficult economic environments.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P85_S10	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East Africa increased 12%.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 14%, or $250.7 million, to $2,011.4 million, reflecting growth in each major product category and from most countries in the region, several of which had a significant favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	Net sales of approximately $193 million were driven by China, Hong Kong and Thailand, combined, primarily reflecting strong sales of skin care and makeup products.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	While we gained share in the prestige business in China, we are cautious that macroeconomic factors may temper the future growth trend of the Chinese economy.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	Our businesses in Japan, Korea and Australia continued to be challenged due to difficult economic conditions, but we reported net sales gains of approximately $37 million, combined, which for both Japan and Australia were generated predominantly from the strengthening of their respective currencies.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 11%.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 20.5% as compared with 22.0% in the prior year.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	This improvement primarily reflected our efforts in connection with the Program, including strategic changes in the mix of our business and pricing of approximately 140 basis points, favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 10 basis points and the favorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	These improvements were partially offset by an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of potential new brands or channels of distribution that have margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 66.0% as compared with 65.6% in the prior year.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	This change reflected increased spending in advertising, merchandising and sampling costs in line with our strategy of approximately 80 basis points, higher costs related to stock-based compensation of approximately 20 basis points, an increase in general and administrative costs of approximately 10 basis points and higher charges associated with restructuring activities of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	Partially offsetting these changes were lower selling and shipping costs as a percentage of net sales of approximately 50 basis points, lower charges associated with goodwill and other intangible asset impairments of approximately 20 basis points and a favorable change in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	Changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	We anticipate higher investment spending on global advertising, merchandising and sampling to support major launches and existing franchises for fiscal 2013.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	Operating income increased 20%, or $222.3 million, to $1,311.7 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	Operating margin increased to 13.5% of net sales as compared with 12.4% in the prior year, reflecting our higher gross margin, partially offset by the increase in our operating expense margin, as previously discussed.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of $63.2 million, or 0.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2012 and $59.4 million, or 0.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	We believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	In the fiscal 2012 third quarter, we established a provision for then-anticipated returns of approximately $16 million as a result of repositioning certain products due to changes in regulations related to sunscreen products in the United States.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	These regulations were subsequently deferred and, accordingly, we reversed this provision in the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	As the identified products are expected to be sold in the ordinary course of business, we do not expect any significant financial impact due to these regulations.

1001250_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P101_S2	Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.

1001250_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	Based on this evaluation, we decided to discontinue certain of these products in perfumeries and recorded a charge of approximately $31 million to reflect then-anticipated returns of products from participating retailers.

1001250_12_ITEM7_P110_S4	These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Prescriptives products due to the exit from the global wholesale distribution of the brand in fiscal 2010, as well as lower sales of Superfit Makeup from Clinique and Resilience Lift Extreme Makeup from Est e Lauder of approximately $45 million, combined.

1001250_12_ITEM7_P116_S3	This was attributable to improved retail environments, successful launches of skin care products and higher combined sales from our makeup artist brands.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P116_S4	The net sales improvement in our travel retail business also reflected an increase in global airline passenger traffic, new points of distribution and benefits of programs designed to enhance consumers High-Touch experiences and convert travelers into purchasers.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P116_S5	The higher results also reflect the favorable comparison to fiscal 2010 which included a charge related to our long-term perfumery strategy of approximately $31 million, as previously discussed.

1001250_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. as compared with fiscal 2010 increased 47%, or $222.5 million, to $700.8 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased 46% from $1.19 to $1.74.

1001250_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P135_S1	At June 30, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,347.7 million compared with $1,253.0 million at June 30, 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P135_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P135_S3	As of June 30, 2012, approximately 17% of the total balance was insured by governmental agencies.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P135_S4	To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P136_S1	From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P136_S2	To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P137_S1	Our cash and cash equivalents balance at June 30, 2012 includes approximately $708 million of cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P137_S2	We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P137_S3	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P138_S1	Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P139_S1	Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P139_S2	Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P140_S0	A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P140_S1	As of August 13, 2012, our commercial paper is rated A-1 by Standard Poor s and P-1 by Moody s and our long-term debt is rated A with a stable outlook by Standard Poor s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody s.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P141_S0	At June 30, 2012, our outstanding borrowings were as follows:
1001250_12_ITEM7_P142_S0	Consists of $300.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $3.6 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P143_S0	Consists of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.3 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P144_S0	Consists of $300.0 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $0.2 million and a $35.1 million adjustment to reflect the fair value of terminated interest rate swaps.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P145_S0	As of June 30, 2012, we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants, including limitations on indebtedness and liens, and expect continued compliance.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P146_S0	In August 2012, we issued $250.0 million of 2.35% Senior Notes due August 15, 2022 ( 2022 Senior Notes ) and $250.0 million of 3.70% Senior Notes due August 15, 2042 ( 2042 Senior Notes ) in a public offering.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P146_S1	The 2022 Senior Notes were priced at 99.911% with a yield of 2.360%.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P146_S2	The 2042 Senior Notes were priced at 99.567% with a yield of 3.724%.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P146_S3	Interest payments on both notes are required to be made semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15, 2013.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P146_S4	On August 2, 2012, we called for redemption all of the outstanding 2013 Senior Notes on September 4, 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P146_S5	We intend to use approximately $250 million of the net proceeds of the offering for the redemption, of which approximately $18 million to $20 million represents debt extinguishment costs, and to use the remaining amounts for general corporate purposes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P147_S0	We have a $750.0 million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P147_S1	At June 30, 2012, we had $200.0 million of commercial paper outstanding, which we may refinance on a periodic basis as it matures at then-prevailing market interest rates.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P147_S2	At August 13, 2012, we had $200.0 million of commercial paper outstanding.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P147_S3	We also have $164.9 million in additional uncommitted credit facilities, of which $7.1 million was used as of June 30, 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P147_S4	We do not anticipate difficulties in securing this form of working capital financing.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P148_S0	We have a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on July 14, 2015 (the Facility ).
1001250_12_ITEM7_P148_S1	The Facility may be used to provide credit support for our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P148_S2	Up to the equivalent of $250 million of the Facility is available for multi-currency loans.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P148_S3	The interest rate on borrowings under the Facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or % plus the Federal funds rate.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P148_S4	We incurred costs of approximately $1 million to establish the Facility which are being amortized over the term of the Facility.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P148_S5	The Facility has an annual fee of $0.7 million, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P148_S6	The Facility also contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $100.0 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P148_S7	At June 30, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P149_S0	We have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to $150.0 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in Europe.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P149_S1	The interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an all-in fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P149_S2	At June 30, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P149_S3	Debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P150_S0	We have an overdraft borrowing agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which our subsidiary in Turkey may be credited to satisfy outstanding negative daily balances arising from its business operations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P150_S1	In June 2012, we reduced the maximum total available balance outstanding of the overdraft borrowing agreement from 40.0 million Turkish lira ($22.0 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2012) to 25.0 million Turkish lira ($13.8 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2012).
1001250_12_ITEM7_P151_S0	The interest rate applicable to each such credit shall be up to a maximum of 175 basis points per annum above the spot rate charged by the lender or the lender s floating call rate agreed to by us at each borrowing.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P151_S1	There were no debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P151_S2	The outstanding balance at June 30, 2012 was 12.9 million Turkish lira ($7.1 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2012) and is classified as short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P152_S0	Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) was 32% at June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P153_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,126.7 million, $1,027.0 million and $956.7 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P153_S1	The increase in cash flows from operating activities as compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, favorable levels of accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments, and a decrease in the levels of inventory.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P153_S2	These improvements were partially offset by the change in other liabilities, primarily due to the timing of payments and costs related to employee compensation, advertising, merchandising and sampling, and payroll and other taxes, as well as an increase in accounts receivable balances primarily due to the timing of shipments.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P153_S3	Cash flows from operating activities increased in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting the increase in net earnings and the timing and level of accrued income taxes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P153_S4	This increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable balances due to timing of collections, as well as lower levels of accounts payable due to the timing of payments and an increase in inventory in line with forecasted sales activity and to ensure acceptable levels of service.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P154_S0	Net cash used for investing activities was $428.3 million, $606.9 million and $281.4 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P154_S1	The decrease in cash flows used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily reflected a favorable comparison with the fiscal 2011 acquisition of Smashbox Cosmetics, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures for counters and leasehold improvements.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P154_S2	The increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 primarily reflected the fiscal 2011 acquisition of Smashbox Cosmetics, as well as higher cash payments for counters and computer hardware and software.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P155_S0	Net cash used for financing activities was $585.1 million, $313.1 million and $406.1 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P155_S1	The change in net cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases, lower net proceeds from employee stock transactions and an increase in the payment of dividends during the current year as a result of an increase in the annual dividend rate.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P155_S2	The repayment of the 2012 Senior Notes during the current year was offset by proceeds from the issuance of short-term commercial paper.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P155_S3	Subsequent to June 30, 2012, we purchased approximately 2.0 million additional shares of Class A Common Stock for $104.2 million pursuant to our share repurchase program.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P155_S4	The decrease in net cash flows used for financing activities in fiscal 2011 reflected a favorable comparison with fiscal 2010 which included the partial redemption of the 2012 and 2013 Senior Notes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P155_S5	This favorable comparison was offset by an increase in treasury stock purchases and an increase in the common stock dividends during fiscal 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P156_S0	On November 3, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split on our Class A and Class B Common Stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P156_S1	As a result of this action, one additional share was issued on January 20, 2012 for each share held by stockholders of record at the close of business on January 4, 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P157_S0	The stock split did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P157_S1	Share and per share amounts have been restated for the stock split.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P158_S0	During the current year, we paid dividends on Class A and Class B Common Stock of $.525 per share (or an aggregate of $204.0 million) as compared with $.375 per share (or an aggregate of $148.0 million) in the prior year.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P159_S0	Several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P159_S1	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P159_S2	Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ( ERISA ) and subsequent pension legislation, and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P160_S0	For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P160_S1	In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in Item 7.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P161_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P161_S1	The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P162_S0	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P162_S1	This strategy assisted in maintaining a funded ratio of more than 100% as of June 30, 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P162_S2	For fiscal 2012 and 2011, we met or exceeded all minimum contributions required by ERISA for the U.S. Qualified Plan.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P162_S3	These cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan totaled $75.6 million and $35.6 million during fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P162_S4	We made discretionary cash contributions to our post-retirement medical plan in the United States of $9.4 million and $8.4 million during fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P162_S5	As we continue to monitor the performance of our plan assets, we may decide to make discretionary cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement plan in the United States during fiscal 2013, but do not have plans to do so at this time.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P163_S0	For fiscal 2012 and 2011, we made benefit payments under our non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of $6.6 million and $8.8 million, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P163_S1	We expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2013 of approximately $10.8 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P163_S2	For fiscal 2012 and 2011, we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of $29.7 million and $34.1 million, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P163_S3	We expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2013 of approximately $24.7 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P164_S0	Certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn-out provisions.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P164_S1	These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P164_S2	Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P165_S0	For additional contingencies refer to Item 3.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P166_S0	The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of June 30, 2012:
1001250_12_ITEM7_P167_S0	Includes long-term and short-term debt and the related projected interest costs, and to a lesser extent, capital lease commitments.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P167_S1	Interest costs on long-term and short-term debt are projected to be $64.4 million in fiscal 2013, $55.1 million in fiscal 2014, $46.2 million in each of the years from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017 and $549.8 million thereafter.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P168_S0	Projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P168_S1	Including the 2022 Senior Notes and 2042 Senior Notes and redemption of the 2013 Senior Notes, debt service costs are projected to increase $247.2 million in fiscal 2013, decrease $223.9 million in fiscal 2014, increase $15.1 million in each of the years from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, and increase $768.2 million thereafter.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P169_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 Debt .
1001250_12_ITEM7_P170_S0	Minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P170_S1	Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, as well as common area maintenance.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P170_S2	These amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P171_S0	Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments, estimated future earn-out payments, estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements, advertising commitments, capital improvement commitments, planned funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements, obligations related to our cost savings initiatives and acquisitions.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P171_S1	Future earn-out payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2012, without consideration for potential renewal periods.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P172_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Income Taxes for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P172_S1	As of June 30, 2012, the noncurrent portion of our unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties was $106.2 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P172_S2	At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P173_S0	We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P173_S1	We enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P173_S2	We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P174_S0	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P174_S1	Costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to our consolidated financial results.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P175_S0	For each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P176_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P176_S1	We also formally assess, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P176_S2	If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P177_S0	We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with our identified exposures.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P177_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P178_S0	The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P178_S1	We may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P178_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of March 2014.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P178_S3	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P178_S4	The ineffective portion of foreign currency forward contracts is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P178_S5	For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P178_S6	If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to current-period earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P178_S7	As of June 30, 2012, these foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective in all material respects.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P179_S0	At June 30, 2012, we had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,476.0 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P179_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound ($376.7 million), Euro ($223.4 million), Canadian dollar ($184.0 million), Swiss franc ($129.9 million), Australian dollar ($106.5 million), Korean won ($75.1 million) and Thailand baht ($51.3 million).
1001250_12_ITEM7_P180_S0	As a matter of policy, we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P180_S1	The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P180_S2	Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $17.7 million at June 30, 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P180_S3	To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P180_S4	Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P181_S0	Certain of our derivative financial instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P181_S1	At June 30, 2012, we were in a net asset position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features with two counterparties.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P181_S2	The fair value of those contracts as of June 30, 2012 was approximately $2.8 million.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P181_S3	As of June 30, 2012, we were in compliance with such credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P182_S0	We use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P182_S1	Value-at-risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P182_S2	We estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250-day period.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P182_S3	The high, low and average measured value-at-risk during fiscal 2012 related to our foreign exchange contracts is as follows:
1001250_12_ITEM7_P183_S0	The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P184_S0	We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths.
1001250_12_ITEM7_P184_S1	Our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P51_S3	Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company s customers.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	Included in inventory and promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P52_S2	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P52_S3	In addition, and as necessary, specific reserves for future known or anticipated events may be established.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ( fair-value hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( foreign currency cash-flow hedge), or (iii) not designated as a hedging instrument.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge that is highly effective are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments).
1001250_12_ITEM15_P53_S3	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a foreign currency cash-flow hedge of a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in OCI.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P53_S4	Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).
1001250_12_ITEM15_P53_S5	Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company s operating segments.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P60_S2	The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P60_S3	The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P60_S4	Impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) the Company determines impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, impairment is recorded.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	Testing goodwill for impairment requires the Company to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	The assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company uses industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and, in certain instances, the Company engages third-party valuation specialists for advice.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	To determine fair value of the reporting unit, the Company generally uses an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P64_S2	In certain circumstances, equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable (e.g., only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins).
1001250_12_ITEM15_P64_S3	The Company believes both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	Under the market approach, the Company utilizes information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, to value the reporting unit.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	The key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	To determine fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company uses an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P66_S2	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P66_S3	Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P67_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P68_S1	Domestic and international sales are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries and specialty retailers.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P68_S2	The Company grants credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Company s largest customer sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for $1,048.1 million, or 11%, $967.6 million, or 11%, and $876.3 million, or 11%, of the Company s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P69_S1	This customer accounted for $110.2 million, or 10%, and $92.3 million, or 10%, of the Company s accounts receivable at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P70_S1	In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P70_S2	In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at the Company s retail stores.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company records revenues generated from purchase with purchase promotions in Net Sales and costs of its purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions in Cost of sales.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	The Company s practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P72_S2	In accepting returns, the Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P72_S3	As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.5% in fiscal 2012 and 2011 and 4.3% in fiscal 2010.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	Certain incentive arrangements require the payment of a fee to customers based on their attainment of pre-established sales levels.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	These fees have been recorded as a reduction of Net Sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were not material to the results of operations in any period presented.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Company enters into transactions related to advertising, product promotions and demonstrations, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P75_S1	These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P75_S2	The Company s share of the cost of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were approximately $1,343 million, $1,152 million and $1,070 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development costs were $2,655.7 million, $2,345.8 million and $2,015.9 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are expensed as incurred.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P76_S1	Excluding the impact of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions, advertising, merchandising, sampling and promotion expenses included in operating expenses were $2,458.9 million, $2,160.7 million and $1,818.5 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	Research and development costs amounted to $96.5 million, $85.7 million and $79.5 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	Shipping and handling expenses of $312.4 million, $289.7 million and $263.3 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and include distribution center costs, third-party logistics costs and outbound freight.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	The Company considers lease renewals when such renewals are reasonably assured.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding from its lessors.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P80_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as a reduction of rent expense.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company s license agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors trademarks.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	The licenses typically have an initial term of approximately 5 years to 11 years, and are renewable subject to the Company s compliance with the license agreement provisions.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P81_S2	The remaining terms, including the potential renewal periods, range from approximately 9 years to 29 years.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	Most of the Company s licenses were entered into to create new business.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	In some cases, the Company acquired, or entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a pre-existing beauty products business.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P83_S2	In those cases, other intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the award, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	Upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock units, performance share units and market share units, the resulting excess tax benefits, if any, are credited to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P86_S2	Any resulting tax deficiencies will first be offset against those cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P86_S3	If the cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital are exhausted, tax deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P86_S4	Excess tax benefits are required to be reflected as financing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P87_S2	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P87_S3	Based on the Company s assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	If the Company determines that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P89_S2	The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P89_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P89_S4	For those tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P90_S2	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended its authoritative guidance related to multiemployer benefit plans.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	This revised guidance is intended to provide enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures about an employer s significant financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan and, therefore, help financial statement users better understand the financial health of all significant plans in which the employer participates.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P91_S2	To the extent the information required under the revised standard is not available in the public domain, as may be the case for some foreign plans, employers should include more qualitative information about the plan.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P91_S3	This disclosure-only guidance became effective for the Company s fiscal 2012, with full retrospective application required.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P91_S4	One of the Company s international affiliates participates in a multiemployer benefit plan, and the Company has concluded that its participation in this plan is not significant and did not require additional disclosure in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	In May 2011, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements to provide a consistent definition and measurement of fair value, as well as similar disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ).
1001250_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	This guidance clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and expands the existing disclosure requirements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P92_S2	This guidance became effective for the Company s fiscal 2012 third quarter and was applied prospectively.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P92_S3	This guidance did not have an impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P92_S4	As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Company did not change its valuation techniques but made additional disclosures included in Note 12 Fair Value Measurements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	In December 2010, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more-likely-than-not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	In determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that a goodwill impairment exists, consideration should be made as to whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P95_S1	This guidance became effective for the Company s fiscal 2012 first quarter.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P95_S2	The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	In December 2010, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to business combinations entered into by an entity that are material on an individual or aggregate basis.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	These amendments clarify existing guidance that if an entity presents comparative financial statements that include a material business combination, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P96_S2	The amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P96_S3	This guidance became effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date was on or after the first day of the Company s fiscal 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P96_S4	The adoption of this disclosure-only guidance did not have an impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements of assets and liabilities.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	The Company adopted the new guidance in its fiscal 2010 third quarter, except for certain detailed recurring Level 3 disclosures, which became effective for the Company s fiscal 2012 first quarter.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P97_S2	The Company currently does not have any recurring Level 3 assets or liabilities.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	In July 2012, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing their indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing further impairment testing.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P98_S2	If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that it is more-likely-than-not that the asset is impaired, a quantitative test is required.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P98_S3	The guidance becomes effective in the beginning of the Company s fiscal 2014, with early adoption permitted.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P98_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the timing of adopting this guidance which is not expected to have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that creates new disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity s rights of offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P99_S1	This revised guidance helps reconcile differences in the offsetting requirements under U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P99_S2	These requirements mandate that entities disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P99_S3	This disclosure-only guidance becomes effective for the Company s fiscal 2013 third quarter, with retrospective application required.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company currently does not hold any financial or derivative instruments that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	However, the Company currently utilizes the right of offset when netting certain negative cash balances in its consolidated balance sheets.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P100_S2	This guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, but may require certain additional disclosures if such balances are material or if the Company enters into additional arrangements that fall under the provisions of this guidance.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	In September 2011, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P101_S2	If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more-likely-than-not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P101_S3	This guidance becomes effective in the beginning of the Company s fiscal 2013, with early adoption permitted.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P101_S4	The Company is not adopting this guidance early, and it does not expect the guidance to have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	In June 2011, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income, requiring entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P103_S1	This guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P103_S2	In December 2011, the FASB issued an update to this guidance deferring the requirement to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P103_S3	However, the Company is still required to present reclassification adjustments on either the face of the financial statement where comprehensive income is reported or disclose the reclassification adjustments in the notes to the financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P103_S4	This guidance, including the deferral, becomes effective for the Company s fiscal 2013 first quarter, with early adoption permitted and full retrospective application required.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P107_S2	Other intangible assets (e.g., non-compete agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately 2 years to 13 years.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	Intangible assets related to license agreements were amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on the terms of the respective agreements.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Ojon reporting unit identified a potential decline in its projected results of operations, primarily resulting from a softness in the direct response television channel, which caused the Company to review and revise Ojon s long-term forecast.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P112_S1	The Company concluded that these changes in the business of the Ojon reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment test of its trademarks as of December 31, 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P112_S2	These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amount of the customer list may not be recoverable.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P112_S3	The Company performed an interim impairment test for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the customer list as of December 31, 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P112_S4	For the trademarks, the Company concluded that the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the use of a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows ( relief-from-royalty method ).
1001250_12_ITEM15_P112_S5	As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $6.7 million.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P112_S6	This charge was reflected in the hair care product category and in the Americas region.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P112_S7	The Company concluded that the carrying value of the customer list was recoverable.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	As of the Company s annual indefinite-lived asset impairment test on April 1, 2012, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Ojon brand trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P113_S1	As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $3.3 million for the remaining carrying value of the related trademark.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P113_S2	The Company also determined that the future cash flows associated with the Ojon brand customer list were less than its carrying value.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P113_S3	As the remaining carrying value of the customer list is not recoverable, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $11.7 million.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Ojon reporting unit reassessed and subsequently altered the timing of new market initiatives, including the rollout of reformulated product lines and certain components of its future international expansion plans, resulting in revisions to its internal forecasts.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P115_S1	The Company concluded that these changes in circumstances in the Ojon reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark and goodwill.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P115_S2	Additionally, these changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amount of the customer list may not be recoverable.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P115_S3	The Company performed an interim impairment test for the trademark and a recoverability test for the customer list as of February 28, 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P115_S4	For the customer list, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of this asset was recoverable.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P115_S5	However, for the Ojon trademark, the Company concluded that the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, based on the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P115_S6	As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $7.0 million.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P115_S7	After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed an interim impairment test for goodwill and recorded an impairment charge for the remaining goodwill related to the Ojon reporting unit of $29.3 million, at the exchange rate in effect at that time.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P115_S8	The fair value of the reporting unit was based upon the income approach, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P116_S0	As of the Company s annual indefinite-lived asset impairment test on April 1, 2011, the Company determined, as a result of a planned discontinuation, that the carrying values of two brand trademarks exceeded their estimated fair values, which were based on the use of the relief-from-royalty method.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P116_S2	These impairment charges were reflected in the makeup and skin care product categories and in the Americas region.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P118_S1	The Company anticipates the Program will result in related restructuring and other charges, inclusive of cumulative charges recorded to date and through the remainder of the Program, totaling between $350 million and $450 million before taxes.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P118_S2	While the Company will continue to seek cost savings opportunities, the Company s current plans are to identify and approve specific initiatives under the Program through calendar 2012 and execute those initiatives through fiscal 2013.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	Resize and Reorganize the Organization The Company continued the realignment and optimization of its organization to better leverage scale, improve productivity, reduce complexity and achieve cost savings in each region and across various functions.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P121_S1	This included reduction of the workforce which occurred through the consolidation of certain functions, which the Company achieved through a combination of normal attrition and job eliminations, and the closure and consolidation of certain distribution and office facilities.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	Turnaround or Exit Unprofitable Operations To improve the profitability in certain of the Company s brands and regions, the Company has selectively exited certain channels of distribution, categories and markets, and has made changes to turnaround others.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P122_S1	This included the exit from the global wholesale distribution of the Company s Prescriptives brand, the reformulation of Ojon brand products and the exit from the global distribution of Sean John products.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P122_S2	In connection with these activities, the Company incurred charges related to product returns, inventory write-offs, reduction of workforce and termination of contracts.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P123_S0	Outsourcing In order to balance the growing need for information technology support with the Company s efforts to provide the most efficient and cost effective solutions, the Company continued the outsourcing of certain information technology processes.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P137_S1	The Company intends to reinvest these earnings in its foreign operations indefinitely, except where it is able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P137_S2	As of June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had not provided federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $1,208 million and $1,068 million, respectively, of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	The determination and estimation of the future income tax consequences in all relevant taxing jurisdictions involves the application of highly complex tax laws in the countries involved, particularly in the United States, and is based on the tax profile of the Company in the year of earnings repatriation.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P138_S1	Accordingly, it is not practicable to determine the amount of tax associated with such undistributed earnings.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	With the exception of approximately $245 million of net operating loss and other carryforwards with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 30, 2012, these carryforwards expire at various dates through fiscal 2032.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P142_S2	Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, in the amount of $3.3 million and $0.4 million as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, have been recorded to reflect the tax benefits of the carryforwards not utilized to date.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	A full valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	Compliance Assurance Program ( CAP ).
1001250_12_ITEM15_P149_S1	The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of income tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P149_S2	As of June 30, 2012, the compliance process was ongoing with respect to fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company formally concluded the IRS examination of fiscal years 2009 and 2010.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	The conclusion of this examination did not materially impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reached a formal agreement with the IRS concerning the examination adjustments proposed for fiscal 2006 through 2008.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P151_S1	As a result, the Company applied a prior cash payment of $20.5 million made to the U.S. Treasury as an advance deposit toward these agreed-to adjustments.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P151_S2	As a result of the settlement, the Company recognized a tax and interest benefit of $11 million, net of tax.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	The Company is currently undergoing income tax examinations and controversies in several state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	These matters are in various stages of completion and involve complex multi-jurisdictional issues common among multinational enterprises, including transfer pricing, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	The Company had been notified of a disallowance of tax deductions claimed by its subsidiary in Spain for fiscal years 1999 through 2002.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P153_S1	An appeal against this reassessment was filed with the Chief Tax Inspector.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P153_S2	On July 18, 2005, the final assessment made by the Chief Tax Inspector was received, confirming the reassessment made by the tax auditors.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	During fiscal 2006, an appeal against this final assessment was filed with the Madrid Regional Economic Administrative Tribunal ( TEAR ).
1001250_12_ITEM15_P154_S1	In view of the TEAR s silence, during fiscal 2007 the claim was presumed to be dismissed and an appeal was filed against it with the Central Economic-Administrative Tribunal ( TEAC ).
1001250_12_ITEM15_P154_S2	During the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter, the TEAC dismissed the claim and, on June 10, 2008, the Company filed an appeal for judicial review with the National Appellate Court.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P154_S3	During fiscal 2009, the Company completed the appeal proceedings with the National Appellate Court and, as of June 30, 2011, awaited the court s decision.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P154_S4	During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the National Appellate Court notified the Company that the appeal was denied.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P155_S0	The Company has been assessed corporate income tax and interest of $3.8 million, net of tax, at current exchange rates.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P155_S1	In response, the Company filed an appeal with the Spain Supreme Court.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P155_S2	While no assurance can be given as to the outcome in respect of this assessment and pending appeal in the Spanish courts, based on the decision of the National Appellate Court, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the subsidiary will be successful in its appeal to the Spain Supreme Court.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	Accordingly, the Company established a reserve which resulted in an increase to the provision for income taxes equal to the $3.8 million exposure, net of tax.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P156_S1	Separately, during fiscal 2012, the Company s subsidiary in Spain made cash payments totaling $4.1 million, at current exchange rates, to the Spain tax authority as an advance deposit to limit the additional interest that would be due to the Spain tax authority should it receive an unfavorable decision from the Spain Supreme Court.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	During fiscal 2012, the Company concluded various state, local and foreign income tax audits and examinations while several other matters, including those noted above, were initiated or remained pending.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P158_S1	On the basis of the information available in this regard as of June 30, 2012, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in a range of $20 million to $25 million within 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of global tax examinations and controversies and a potential lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	The tax years subject to examination vary depending on the tax jurisdiction.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P159_S1	As of June 30, 2012, the following tax years remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions indicated:

1001250_12_ITEM15_P176_S3	The interest rate on borrowings under the Facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or % plus the Federal funds rate.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P176_S4	The Company incurred costs of approximately $1 million to establish the Facility which are being amortized over the term of the Facility.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P176_S5	The Facility has an annual fee of $0.7 million, payable quarterly, based on the Company s current credit ratings.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P176_S6	The Facility also contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $100.0 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P178_S0	Refer to Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies for the Company s projected debt service payments, as of June 30, 2012, over the next five fiscal years.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P179_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P180_S0	The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P180_S1	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company s aggregate liability portfolio.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P180_S2	The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P180_S3	The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P180_S4	Costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company s consolidated financial results.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P181_S0	For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P182_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P182_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P182_S2	If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P183_S0	The fair values of the Company s derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets are presented as follows:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P184_S0	(1) See Note 12 Fair Value Measurements for further information about how the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities are determined.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P185_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P186_S0	The amounts of the gains and losses related to the Company s derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are presented as follows:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P187_S0	(2) The amount of gain (loss) recognized in earnings related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing was $(0.8) million and $0.3 million for fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P187_S1	The gain recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationships was de minimis for fiscal 2012.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P187_S2	The loss recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationships was $0.5 million for fiscal 2011.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P188_S0	Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P189_S0	(1) Changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P190_S0	The amounts of the gains and losses related to the Company s derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments are presented as follows:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P191_S0	Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P192_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P193_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P193_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P194_S0	The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P194_S1	The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of March 2014.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P194_S2	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P195_S0	The ineffective portion of foreign currency forward contracts is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P195_S1	For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P195_S2	If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in accumulated OCI are reclassified to current-period earnings.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P196_S0	As of June 30, 2012, the Company s foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective in all material respects.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P196_S1	The estimated net gain as of June 30, 2012 that is expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $8.6 million.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P196_S2	The accumulated gain (loss) on derivative instruments in accumulated OCI was $15.3 million and $(13.2) million as of June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P197_S0	At June 30, 2012, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,476.0 million.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P197_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound ($376.7 million), Euro ($223.4 million), Canadian dollar ($184.0 million), Swiss franc ($129.9 million), Australian dollar ($106.5 million), Korean won ($75.1 million) and Thailand baht ($51.3 million).
1001250_12_ITEM15_P198_S0	At June 30, 2011, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,490.7 million.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P198_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Swiss franc ($284.9 million), British pound ($273.5 million), Canadian dollar ($210.1 million), Euro ($164.6 million), Australian dollar ($110.7 million), Korean won ($77.9 million) and Russian ruble ($45.2 million).
1001250_12_ITEM15_P199_S0	The Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the identified exposures.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P199_S1	During fiscal 2011, the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreements which had effectively converted the fixed rate interest on its outstanding 2017 Senior Notes to variable interest rates.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P199_S2	Additionally, the instrument, which was classified as an asset, had a fair value of $47.4 million at the date of cash settlement.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P199_S3	This net settlement is classified as a financing activity on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P199_S4	Hedge accounting treatment was discontinued prospectively and the fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt is being amortized against interest expense over the remaining life of the debt.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P200_S0	As a matter of policy, the Company only enters into derivative contracts with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P200_S1	The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P200_S2	Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $17.7 million at June 30, 2012, of which 35% and 16% were attributable to two counterparties.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P200_S3	To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P200_S4	Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P201_S0	Certain of the Company s derivative financial instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P201_S1	At June 30, 2012, the Company was in a net asset position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features with two counterparties.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P201_S2	The fair value of those contracts as of June 30, 2012 was approximately $2.8 million.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P201_S3	As of June 30, 2012, the Company was in compliance with such credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P202_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P203_S0	The Company records its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P203_S1	The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations, goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment, and liabilities associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P204_S0	The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P204_S1	The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P205_S0	Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P206_S0	Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P207_S0	Level 3: Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P207_S1	The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument s valuation.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P208_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2012:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P209_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2011:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P210_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P211_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy and impairment charges for certain of its nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2012:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P212_S0	To determine fair value of the trademark at December 31, 2011, the Company used the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P212_S1	This method, which is an income approach, assumed that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P212_S2	The calculation of fair value requires significant judgment in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P212_S3	As these inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the fair value calculation, the trademark was classified as Level 3.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P212_S4	In determining its fair value, a terminal growth rate of 3% was applied to future cash flows, and was used in conjunction with a 1.5% royalty rate discounted to present value at a 17% rate.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P213_S0	To determine fair value of the trademark and customer list at April 1, 2012, the Company assessed the future performance of the related reporting unit and determined that negative cash flows in future forecasted periods would not support a royalty rate for the calculation of fair value of the trademark and negative income associated with existing customers would not support a value for the customer list.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P213_S1	The Company therefore concluded that the carrying value of these assets were not recoverable.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P214_S0	See Note 5 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion of the Company s impairment testing.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P215_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy and impairment charges for certain of its nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2011:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P216_S0	(1) See Note 5 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for discussion of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, the description of the inputs and information used to develop those inputs.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P217_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company s other classes of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P218_S0	The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P219_S0	Available-for-sale securities Available-for-sale securities are generally comprised of mutual funds and are valued using quoted market prices on an active exchange.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P220_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P220_S1	The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P220_S2	To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to 12 months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than 12 months.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P221_S0	Current and long-term debt The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P221_S1	To a lesser extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P225_S1	The Company s funding policy consists of contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P225_S2	Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ), as amended, and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P226_S0	The Company also has an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P234_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P235_S0	The discount rate for the Company s U.S. plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P235_S1	The Company believes the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of its U.S. plans.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P236_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P249_S0	The fair value is determined using the Net Asset Value ( NAV ) provided by the administrator of the fund.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P249_S1	The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P249_S2	The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and is primarily classified as Level 2.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P249_S3	When quoted in an active market, these investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P250_S0	Government and agency securities - When quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P250_S1	When quoted market prices are not available in an active market, these investments are classified as Level 2.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P251_S0	The fair values reflect the closing price reported on a major market where the individual securities are traded.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P252_S0	Debt instruments - The fair values are based on a compilation of primarily observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P252_S1	These investments are primarily classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P253_S0	The fair values are determined using NAV provided by the administrator of the fund.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P253_S1	The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the trust/entity, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P253_S2	When quoted in an active market, these investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P253_S3	When the market is not active, these investments are generally classified within Level 2.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P253_S4	When the market is not active and some inputs are unobservable, these investments are generally classified within Level 3.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P254_S0	Insurance contracts - These instruments are issued by insurance companies.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P254_S1	The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying investment held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P254_S2	The underlying investments are government, asset-backed and fixed income securities.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P255_S0	Insurance contracts are generally classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor other observable inputs for pricing.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P256_S0	Interests in limited partnerships and hedge fund investments - One limited partnership investment and one hedge fund was valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the partnership/fund.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P256_S1	The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the partnership/fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P256_S2	All other limited partnership investments and hedge fund investments are private equity funds and the fair values are determined by the fund managers based on the estimated value of the various holdings of the fund portfolio.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P256_S3	These investments are primarily classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P269_S0	Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, as well as common area maintenance.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P269_S1	These amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P269_S2	Such amounts have not been material to total rent expense.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P269_S3	Total rental expense included in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was $304.9 million in fiscal 2012, $290.9 million in fiscal 2011 and $272.8 million in fiscal 2010.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P270_S4	At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P271_S0	The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its business.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P271_S1	Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P271_S2	However, management s assessment of the Company s current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company, not presently known to the Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P271_S3	Except as disclosed below, reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P273_S1	On December 23, 2011, the Paris Commercial Court issued its judgment, awarding the former owner 22.9 million ($28.8 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2012) plus interest from 2007.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P273_S4	Based upon its assessment of the case, as well as the advice of external counsel, the Company is maintaining the amount it previously accrued as an amount that it believes will ultimately be paid based on the probable outcome of the appeal.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P273_S5	Such amount is less than the Paris Commercial Court s award.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P274_S0	In November 2011, the Company settled a commercial dispute with third parties that was outside its normal operations.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P289_S0	The following is a summary of the per-share weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted and total intrinsic value of stock options exercised:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P290_S0	The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P291_S0	The Company uses a weighted-average expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P291_S1	The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P292_S0	For the weighted-average expected option life assumption, the Company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P292_S1	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate for the expected term of the options and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P293_S0	During fiscal 2012, the Company granted approximately 260,000 PSUs, which will be settled in stock subject to the achievement of the Company s net sales, diluted net earnings per common share and return on invested capital goals for the three fiscal years ending June 30, 2014, all subject to the continued employment or retirement of the grantees.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P293_S1	Settlement will be made pursuant to a range of opportunities relative to the net sales, diluted net earnings per common share and return on invested capital targets of the Company and, as such, the compensation cost of the PSU is subject to adjustment based upon the attainability of these target goals.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P293_S2	No settlement will occur for results below the applicable minimum threshold of a target and additional shares shall be issued if performance exceeds the targeted performance goals.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P294_S0	Certain PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the PSU.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P294_S1	Other PSUs granted in fiscal 2012 are not accompanied by dividend equivalent rights and, as such, were valued at the closing market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant less the discounted present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the vesting period.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P294_S2	These awards are subject to the provisions of the agreement under which the PSUs are granted.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P294_S3	The PSUs were valued at the closing market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant and generally vest at the end of the performance period.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P298_S0	The following is a summary of the status of the Company s RSUs as of June 30, 2012 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P299_S0	As of June 30, 2012, the Company had one outstanding market share with a grant date fair value of $10.6 million that was estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions: contractual life of 41 months, a weighted-average expected volatility of 29%, a weighted-average risk-free interest rate of 1.6% and a weighted-average dividend yield of 1.0%.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P299_S1	The Company used an expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities from options on the underlying stock.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P299_S2	The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P299_S3	The expected life is equal to the contractual term of the grant.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P299_S4	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rates over the contractual term of the grant and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P300_S1	The share units are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock as provided for in that plan.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P300_S2	Share units are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that are converted to additional share units when such dividends are declared.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P302_S0	Certain non-employee directors defer cash compensation in the form of cash payout share units, which are not subject to the Plans.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P302_S1	These share units are classified as liabilities and, as such, their fair value is adjusted to reflect the current market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P302_S2	The Company recorded $0.8 million, $4.9 million and $2.3 million as compensation expense to reflect additional deferrals and the change in the market value for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P303_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P304_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share ( basic EPS ) is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain conditions).
1001250_12_ITEM15_P304_S1	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share assuming dilution ( diluted EPS ) is computed by reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P305_S0	A reconciliation between the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P306_S0	As of June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, outstanding stock options that were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive were de minimis.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P306_S1	As of June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, 0.6 million, 0.7 million and 0.6 million, respectively, of PSUs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement of certain performance targets of the Company, as discussed in Note 16 Stock Programs.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P307_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P308_S0	The components of Accumulated OCI ( AOCI ) included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consist of the following:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P309_S0	Of the $17.4 million, net of tax, derivative instrument gain recorded in AOCI at June 30, 2012, $9.8 million in gains, net of tax, related to foreign currency forward contracts, which the Company will reclassify to earnings through March 2014.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P309_S1	Also included in the net derivative instrument gain recorded in AOCI was $8.2 million, net of tax, related to the October 2003 gain from the settlement of the treasury lock agreements upon the issuance of the Company s 2033 Senior Notes, which is being reclassified to earnings as an offset to interest expense over the life of the debt.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P309_S2	These gains were partially offset by $0.6 million, net of tax, related to a loss from the settlement of a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements upon the issuance of the Company s 2037 Senior Notes, which is being reclassified to earnings as an addition to interest expense over the life of the debt.

1001250_12_ITEM15_P312_S0	Supplemental cash flow information is as follows:
1001250_12_ITEM15_P313_S0	Reportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Chief Executive ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P313_S1	As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P314_S0	Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P315_S0	While the Company s results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P315_S1	Accordingly, net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P315_S2	These product categories meet the definition of operating segments and, accordingly, additional financial data are provided below.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P316_S0	The other segment includes the sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P317_S0	Product category performance is measured based upon net sales before returns associated with restructuring activities, and earnings before income taxes, other income, net interest expense, interest expense on debt extinguishment and total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P317_S1	Returns and charges associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to the product categories because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide program to redesign the Company s organizational structure.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P317_S2	The accounting policies for the Company s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales.
1001250_12_ITEM15_P317_S3	The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.

1001250_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	As of August 19, 2013, we operate approximately 690 single-brand stores worldwide, the majority of which are in the United States, and expect that number to increase moderately over the next several years.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P49_S3	We also operate approximately 130 multi-brand stores.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	We primarily sell Flirt!, GoodSkin Labs, American Beauty and grassroots research labs products in approximately 1,100 Kohl s Department Stores in the United States and internationally in pharmacies, perfumeries and department stores representing approximately 1,400 additional points of sale.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	We currently sell products from 15 of our brands directly to consumers online through approximately 180 of our own e-commerce and certain of our m-commerce sites.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	Some or all of these brands are sold online in 20 countries including the following: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria, Brazil, Russia, Denmark, Italy, Australia, Korea, China and Japan.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our strategy is to build strong relationships with selected retailers globally.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	Senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis, and we believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our largest customer, Macy s Inc., sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for 11% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 and 10% of our accounts receivable as of June 30, 2013 and 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our marketing strategy is built around Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	Mrs. Est e Lauder formulated this marketing philosophy to provide High-Touch service and high quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	Our marketing efforts focus principally on communicating the quality, value and benefits of our products.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	Each of our brands is distinctively positioned, and is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P53_S4	We regularly advertise our products on television, in magazines and newspapers, by digital and social media, on billboards and through direct mail and photo displays at international airports and seek editorial coverage for our brands and products in publications and other media.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	Promotional activities and in-store displays are designed to attract new consumers and introduce existing consumers to different products in the line.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as purchase with purchase and gift with purchase.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P54_S2	Such activities attract consumers to our counters and allow us to introduce them to our products.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P54_S3	Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers, retailers and beauty consultants at the points of sale.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P54_S4	These include Est e Lauder Beauty Advisors, Clinique Consultants, Aramis Selling Specialists, Origins Guides and M A C and Bobbi Brown Makeup Artists.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	At in-store counters, consumers are offered a High-Touch experience with personal consultations to market individual products as well as to provide education on their use and application.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	We conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	We believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our High-Touch approach promotes the total value we offer by leveraging our in-person and virtual assets, as well as merchandising and education, to provide a customized consumer experience.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	To support this initiative, we continue to expand our online strategy into a multi-pronged digital strategy that encompasses e-commerce, m-commerce, as well as digital and social media.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	We have dedicated resources to implement coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	We continue to use the Internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P57_S4	Currently, 18 of our brands have marketing sites.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P57_S5	In order to continue to offer unparalleled service and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online, we partner with key brick and mortar retailers to strengthen their e-commerce business and drive sales of our brands on their websites, continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), and support e-commerce and m-commerce business via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house creative teams.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	The creative staff designs and produces the sales materials, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development costs were $2,798.0 million, $2,655.7 million and $2,345.8 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	These amounts include activities relating to purchase with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in cost of sales.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	Information systems support business processes including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	We expect that these systems will continue to provide pertinent inventory and sales data in the short term.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	As part of our long-term effort to enhance these systems and increase productivity, we continue to implement our Strategic Modernization Initiative ( SMI ), which includes an enterprise-wide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands, operating units and sales locations.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P60_S3	As part of SMI, we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to SAP-based technologies ( SAP ) with the majority of our locations being enabled through calendar 2014.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	In parallel with our SAP deployment, we are creating a more focused global information technology organization utilizing industry standard processes.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	We are also taking this opportunity to rebalance our information technology resources to better align with our global business growth.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P61_S2	We plan to continue to explore opportunities to create a more efficient organization.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	Of the many systems currently being utilized, the most significant to our business needs are: (i) a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer, or plan to offer, which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality; (ii) a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit ( SKU ) level at most significant retail sales locations (i.e. sell-through data), increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development, manufacturing and marketing strategies; (iii) an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers, allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically, with minimal paperwork; and (iv) an inventory management system that provides us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to forecasted requirements.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	As we continue to modernize our key processes and the related systems and infrastructure, we are developing upgraded capabilities to support our human resource and retail operations.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	The plan is to progressively develop and deploy key systems globally over the next several years as appropriate according to local requirements and priorities.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	Marketing, product development and packaging groups work with our research and development group to identify shifts in consumer preferences, develop new products and improve, redesign or reformulate existing products.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P63_S2	In addition, research and development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis to provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	The research and development group has long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	Members of the group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	We do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, nor ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	As of June 30, 2013, we had approximately 500 employees engaged in research and development.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	Research and development costs totaled $103.6 million, $96.5 million and $85.7 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P66_S2	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P66_S3	We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see Item 2.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	We manufacture our products primarily in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies and reduce costs.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P67_S2	Our major manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily manufacture one type of product (e.g., lipsticks) for all of the principal brands.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P67_S3	Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P67_S4	While we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and third party manufacturers is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity, technology and productivity.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P67_S5	To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize a network of third-party manufacturers on a global basis, including an increased percentage of volume in Asia/Pacific to support our growth.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P68_S2	We have continued to establish regional distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P69_S2	Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations department.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P69_S3	We are making a concentrated effort in supplier rationalization with the specific objective of reducing costs, increasing innovation and speed to market and improving quality.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P69_S4	In addition, we continue to focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P69_S5	As a result of sourcing initiatives, there is increased dependency on certain suppliers, but we believe that our portfolio of these suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	We are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will change suppliers, and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	The skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition throughout the world.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact consumers choices among competing products and brands.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P72_S2	Advertising, promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store demonstrations also have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	With our numerous brands, sold in various channels, we are one of the world s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names.

1001250_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	In addition, several products and packaging for such products are covered by design patents or copyrights.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P78_S2	While we consider these patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is considered material to the conduct of our business.

1001250_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	A limited number of employees outside of the United States are covered by a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, shipment, disposal and safety of our products.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable federal, state, local and international and other countries rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment or that relate to climate change.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	There are no significant capital expenditures for environmental control or climate change matters either planned in the current year or expected in the near future.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	Many of our customers that are retailers follow a 4-4-5 retail calendar which may influence the amount and timing of their order placement and receipt of goods in any fiscal quarter.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	In a traditional 4-4-5 retail calendar, each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	As a result, our customers retail quarter-end and our fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions.
1001250_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.

1001250_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading prices of our securities, may be adversely affected.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors actions in these areas.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Also, the consolidation in the retail trade has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers, including large-format retailers, who have increased their negotiating strength.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	This could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	A severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P4_S6	In addition, certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We must continually work to develop, manufacture and market new products, maintain and adapt our High-Touch services to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The issue is compounded by the increasing use of social and digital media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our financial results will suffer.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Achieving our long-term strategy will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These investments may result in short-term costs without any current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings, at least in the short term.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We continuously review acquisition opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If required, the financing for any of these acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Acquisitions entail numerous risks, which may include:
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from, or customers of, acquired businesses; diversion of management s attention from our core businesses; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	A general economic downturn, or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P16_S7	If a retailer was to liquidate, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer s inventory of our products to protect brand equity.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or local or international conflicts around the world, or as a result of a terrorist attack, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation, or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes or seismic events, can have a short-term and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Events that impact consumers willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business, including travel retail, a significant contributor to our overall results, and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A downturn in the economies of, or continuing recessions in, the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence, the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We continue to see weakness due to global economic uncertainties and volatility in financial markets, particularly in certain Southern European countries and Korea.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Elsewhere, we are cautious of a slowing retail environment in the United States in the short term and that a slowing of the future growth trend of the Chinese economy may temper our retail sales growth, including that of our travel retail business.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	While we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, laws and regulations relating to data privacy, anti-corruption, advertising, manufacturing, distribution, product registration, ingredients, chemicals and packaging, laws in Europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are involved, and may become involved in the future, in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that, if adversely decided or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, other disputes or regulatory proceedings.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In general, claims made by us or against us in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	As we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our consumers standards, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our key personnel.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Competition for these employees can be intense.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P31_S4	We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P31_S5	This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We are subject to risks related to our foreign operations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We operate on a global basis, with a majority of our fiscal 2013 net sales and operating income generated outside the United States.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely, except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	A portion of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the United States.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	adverse weather conditions, currency exchange controls, and social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	A disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Some of our products rely on single or a limited number of suppliers.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Further, the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities, in compliance with applicable standards, and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our information systems and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches, outages, and other risks.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We have information systems that support our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We have e-commerce, m-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P43_S4	The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain information that is confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive, including personal information with respect to customers and employees.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Moreover, the success of our e-commerce and m-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees and customers personal information, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees and customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P45_S5	In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	As part of our Strategic Modern Initiative ( SMI ), we are implementing enterprise-wide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands, regions and functions.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We anticipate the continued migration of our operations to SAP, with the majority of our locations to be enabled through calendar 2014.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We are also implementing other systems, including global human resource management systems and retail operating systems.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Like most entity-wide changes to software systems, the implementation of SMI and other systems involve risks and uncertainties.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Failure to implement SMI and other systems as planned, in terms of timing, specifications and/or costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	As we outsource more functions, we will become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	As part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	These include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations, and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal 2013, we provided guidance as to a number of assumptions, including our expected net sales and earnings per share for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014 and the quarter ending September 30, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P53_S4	While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P53_S5	In addition, the longer-term guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our net sales and/or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q).
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P55_S3	If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P55_S5	We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We are controlled by the Lauder family.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	As a result of their control of us, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	As of August 19, 2013, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having 86% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In addition, there are four members of the Lauder family who are employees, including three who are members of our Board of Directors.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P57_S3	As a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the Company, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including, without limitation, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets, for the foreseeable future.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a controlled company under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	As a controlled company, we are exempt under the New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities; and that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	While we have voluntarily caused our Board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and the Compensation Committee to have the required provisions, we are not requiring our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and Compensation Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors.
1001250_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	As a result of our use of the controlled company exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.
1001250_13_ITEM1B_P0_S0	As of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, there were no unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1001250_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following table sets forth our principal owned and leased manufacturing, assembly, research and development and distribution facilities as of August 19, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	The leases expire at various times through 2028 subject to certain renewal options.
1001250_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own, lease and occupy numerous offices, assembly and distribution facilities and warehouses in the United States and abroad.
1001250_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	We consider our properties to be generally in good condition and believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet anticipated requirements.
1001250_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	We lease approximately 608,000 square feet of rentable space for our principal offices in New York, New York and own an office building of approximately 57,000 square feet in Melville, New York.
1001250_13_ITEM2_P1_S3	As of August 19, 2013, we directly operated approximately 820 retail stores.
1001250_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business.
1001250_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	However, management s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.
1001250_13_ITEM3_P0_S3	Except as disclosed below, reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to our consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	During the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter, the former owner of the Darphin brand initiated litigation in the Paris Commercial Court against us seeking to recover 60.0 million ($78.3 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2013) that he claims he was owed as additional consideration for the sale of Darphin to us in April 2003.
1001250_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	On December 23, 2011, the Paris Commercial Court issued its judgment, awarding the former owner 22.9 million ($29.9 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2013) plus interest from 2007.
1001250_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	We have filed our appeal with the Paris Court of Appeal and oral arguments for the appeal are scheduled for December 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	In accordance with the judgment, in January 2012, we paid 25.3 million ($33.0 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2013) to the former owner and received from him a bank guarantee to assure repayment to us of such sum (or any part thereof) in the event that the judgment is reversed by the Paris Court of Appeal.
1001250_13_ITEM3_P1_S4	Based upon our assessment of the case, as well as the advice of external counsel, we are maintaining the amount we previously accrued as an amount that we believe will ultimately be paid based on the probable outcome of the appeal.
1001250_13_ITEM3_P1_S5	Such amount is less than the Paris Commercial Court s award.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A Common Stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EL.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table shows the high and low per share sales prices as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012:
1001250_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	We expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future, but there can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will continue to declare them.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	We transitioned to a quarterly dividend payout schedule for our Class A and Class B Common Stock beginning in the fiscal 2013 third quarter.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	Accordingly, the total cash dividends per share in fiscal 2013 is equivalent to six quarterly dividends.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P1_S3	As a result, the total value of cash dividends per share expected to be paid in fiscal 2014 will be lower than the dividends per share paid in fiscal 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	On August 14, 2013, a dividend was declared in the amount of $.18 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	The dividend is payable in cash on September 16, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 30, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of August 19, 2013, there were 8,464 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 17 record holders of Class B Common Stock.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 216.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	As of June 30, 2013, the cumulative total of acquired shares pursuant to the authorization was 167.1 million, reducing the remaining authorized share repurchase balance to 48.9 million.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P4_S2	During fiscal 2013, we purchased approximately 6.0 million shares pursuant to the authorization for $342.6 million as outlined in the following table:
1001250_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	(1) The initial program covering the repurchase of 16.0 million shares was announced in September 1998 and increased by 40.0 million shares each in November 2012, November 2007, February 2007 and May 2005 and 20.0 million shares in both May 2004 and October 2002.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	(2) Includes shares that were repurchased by the Company in connection with shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock units.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P5_S2	(3) Includes shares that were repurchased by the Company in connection with shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of performance share units.
1001250_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	Subsequent to June 30, 2013 and as of August 19, 2013, we purchased approximately 0.6 million additional shares of Class A Common Stock for $41.8 million pursuant to our share repurchase program.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The table below summarizes selected financial information.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto beginning on page F-1 of this report.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Fiscal 2013 results included $11.7 million, after tax, or $.03 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	Fiscal 2012 results included $44.1 million, after tax, or $.11 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P1_S2	Fiscal 2011 results included $41.7 million, after tax, or $.10 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P1_S3	Fiscal 2010 results included $55.9 million, after tax, or $.14 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P1_S4	Fiscal 2009 results included $61.7 million, after tax, or $.16 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	In September 2012, we redeemed the $230.1 million principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due November 1, 2013 ( 2013 Senior Notes ) at a price of 108% of the principal amount.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million ($12.2 million after tax, or $.03 per diluted share) representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	In May 2010, we completed a cash tender offer for $130.0 million principal amount of our 6.00% Senior Notes due January 15, 2012 at a price of 108.500% of the principal amount and for $69.9 million principal amount of our 2013 Senior Notes at a tender price of 118.813% of the principal amount.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P3_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $27.3 million representing the tender premium, the pro-rata write-off of unamortized terminated interest rate swap, issuance costs and debt discount, and tender offer costs associated with both series of notes.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	In December 2012, we amended the agreement related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields (a brand then owned by us) to receive a fixed amount in lieu of future contingent consideration and other rights.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P4_S1	Accordingly, we recognized $22.4 million, net of discount of $0.4 million, which has been classified as other income in our consolidated statement of earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P4_S2	Prior to this amendment, we earned and received $0.7 million of contingent consideration.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P5_S0	In November 2011, we settled a commercial dispute with third parties that was outside our normal operations.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P5_S1	In connection therewith, we received a $10.5 million cash payment, which has been classified as other income in our consolidated statement of earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P6_S0	In August 2012, we issued $250.0 million of 2.35% Senior Notes due August 15, 2022 and $250.0 million of 3.70% Senior Notes due August 15, 2042 in a public offering.
1001250_13_ITEM6_P6_S1	We used the net proceeds of the offering to redeem the 2013 Senior Notes and for general corporate purposes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2013 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company s financial condition.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at our retail stores.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	In accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.3% in fiscal 2013 and 3.5% in fiscal 2012 and 2011.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	This accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	Experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P6_S5	The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $22.7 million and $31.1 million as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by $23.0 million, $13.8 million and $9.9 million for customer deductions and write-offs in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and increased by $14.6 million, $11.0 million and $9.5 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Inventory We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	We believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead, as well as inbound freight.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P8_S5	Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Costs We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan ( U.S. Qualified Plan ) and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the Domestic Plans a domestic contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	The amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	While we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	For fiscal 2013, we used a discount rate for our Domestic Plans of 3.90% and varying rates on our international plans of between 1.00% and 7.00%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	The discount rate for our Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	As of June 30, 2013, we used an above-mean yield curve, rather than the broad-based yield curve we used before, because we believe it represents a better estimate of an effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	The benefit obligation of our Domestic Plans would have been higher by approximately $34 million at June 30, 2013 had we not used the above-mean yield curve.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	For our international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	For fiscal 2013, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.50% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of between 2.25% and 7.00% for our international plans.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 Pension, Deferred Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Plans for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	Those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	For fiscal 2013, our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $74 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $64 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	The resulting net deferred gain of approximately $10 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 22 years.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	The actual return on plan assets from our international pension plans exceeded expectations, primarily reflecting a strong performance from fixed income and equity investments.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The lower than expected return on assets from our U.S. Qualified Plan was primarily due to weakness in our fixed income investments, partially offset by our strong equity returns.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	A 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2013 pension expense:
1001250_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2013 would have had the following effects:
1001250_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	To determine the fiscal 2014 net periodic benefit cost, we are using discount rates of 4.90% and 4.30% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and the non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan, respectively, and varying rates for our international plans of between 1.00% and 7.25%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	We are using an expected return on plan assets of 7.50% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 2.25% and 7.25%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	The net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2013 will result in a decrease in pension expense of approximately $5 million in fiscal 2014, of which approximately $3 million is attributable to using the above-mean yield curve for our Domestic Plans, as previously discussed.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	We make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	Impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge is recorded.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	The assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	We use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and, in certain instances, we engage third-party valuation specialists for advice.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	To determine fair value of the reporting unit, we generally use an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	In certain circumstances, equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable (e.g., only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins).
1001250_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	We believe both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Under the income approach, we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Under the market approach, we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, to value the reporting unit.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	The following fiscal 2013 estimates and factors exclude those related to our Darphin reporting unit, for which we recorded an impairment charge of the remainder of its goodwill (see Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairments ).
1001250_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	The fiscal 2013 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections, as considered appropriate for the individual reporting units, ranged between 5% and 22% with the higher growth rates in certain of the Company s smaller reporting units that are expected to continue the growth that they have exhibited over the past several years.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	The fiscal 2012 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections ranged between 5% and 18% with the higher growth rates in those reporting units that start with the smallest base in fiscal 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	For reporting units with positive earnings, growth in the corresponding earnings before interest and taxes ranged from 7% to 49% in fiscal 2013 as compared with 7% to 47% in fiscal 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P30_S4	The terminal growth rates were projected at 3% after five to eight years in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P30_S5	The weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from 8% to 15% in fiscal 2013 as compared with 8% to 16% in fiscal 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P30_S6	The range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2013 impairment testing was from 1.5 to 3.5 times trailing-twelve-month sales and 8.5 to 13.0 times trailing-twelve-month earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P30_S7	The range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2012 impairment testing was from 1.7 to 3.3 times trailing-twelve-month sales and between 10.0 to 12.5 times trailing-twelve-month earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P30_S8	Future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P30_S9	However, a decrease of 100 basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of 100 basis points in our weighted-average cost of capital would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	To determine fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we use an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P32_S4	The following fiscal 2013 estimates exclude those related to the Darphin trademark, for which we recorded an impairment charge for its remaining carrying value (see Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairments ).
1001250_13_ITEM7_P32_S5	The fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 terminal growth rate applied to future cash flows was 3% and the fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 discount rates ranged from 10% to 18%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P32_S6	The fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 royalty rates ranged from 0.5% to 12%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	As of June 30, 2013, we have current net deferred tax assets of $296.0 million and non-current net deferred tax assets of $50.3 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of $92.9 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P34_S4	Based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	If we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P36_S4	For those tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	We classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Quantitative Analysis During the three-year period ended June 30, 2013, there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	The results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	For fiscal 2013, had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.3 million, operating expenses would have changed by approximately $0.8 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.7 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	The collective impact of these changes on operating income, net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc., and net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately $7.1 million, $6.4 million and $.02, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Item 8.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 19 Segment Data and Related Information for all periods presented.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:
1001250_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	Therefore, we present certain net sales information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	We calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Overview We believe that the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers changing shopping habits.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	To be the global leader in prestige beauty, we continued to implement a long-term strategy that is guiding us through fiscal 2016.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	The strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands and functions that are designed to leverage our strengths, make us more productive and grow our sales.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	We have a strong, diverse and highly valuable brand portfolio with global reach and potential, and we plan to continue building upon and leveraging our history of outstanding creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	We have succeeded in expanding our distinctive High-Touch service model and will continue to look for ways to further evolve it within our channels of distribution and geographic regions.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	As an example, we continue to develop capabilities to deliver superior retailing experiences, particularly in freestanding stores.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	We continue to increase brand awareness by expanding our efforts to evolve our online strategy into a multi-pronged digital strategy encompassing e-commerce and m-commerce, as well as digital and social media.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P48_S4	We are leveraging our regional organization in an effort to assure that we are locally relevant with our products, services, marketing and visual merchandising.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	As part of our strategy, we are positioning ourselves to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest-growing areas in prestige beauty.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Skin care, our most profitable product category, continues to be a strategic priority for our innovation and investment spending, particularly in the Asia/Pacific region.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	We are also focusing our attention on luxury consumers across all product categories and have seen continued strength in the net sales of many of our higher-end prestige products.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	We will also continue to build our makeup product category through the introduction of new product offerings, re-emphasize our focus on fragrance innovation to drive profitable growth and expand our hair care brands both in salons and in other retail channels.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	We are strengthening our geographic presence by seeking share growth in large, image-building cities within core markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Japan.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	In addition, we continue to prioritize efforts to expand our presence and accelerate share growth in emerging markets such as China, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Brazil and focus on consumers who purchase in the travel retail channel, in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	We also continue to expand our digital presence which has resulted in growth in the net sales of our products sold online.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	In North America, we continue to implement programs to drive profitable growth in our traditional department store channel.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P50_S4	At the same time, we are also expanding our presence in other channels, such as specialty retailers, freestanding stores and online.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P50_S5	Internationally, we continue to take actions to grow in European perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores in Asia.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P50_S6	In addition, we are emphasizing our skin care and makeup initiatives to boost our travel retail business and continuing efforts to grow our freestanding store, online, specialty retailer and prestige salon businesses.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	The travel retail business continues to be an important source of sales growth and profitability.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	Our business in this channel has benefited from the implementation of programs we designed to target consumers in distinct travel corridors, enhance consumers High-Touch experiences and convert travelers into purchasers.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	While our overall business is performing well, we are seeing continued weakness in certain Southern European countries and Korea due to challenging economic environments.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	In Korea, we are also seeing competitive pressures in prestige beauty.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	Elsewhere, we are cautious of a slowing retail environment in the United States in the short term and a slowing of the future growth trend in China.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	During the first half of fiscal 2013, we also saw a slowing in the exceptional growth we had experienced in fiscal 2012 in travel retail, due in part to select retailer destocking to enable tighter working capital management.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P52_S4	However, our sales growth in the channel has since improved and we expect this trend to continue into fiscal 2014.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P52_S5	We believe we have and will continue to offset to some extent the impact of these events as a result of our strategy to mitigate weaknesses we find in certain areas with strengths in others.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P52_S6	However, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged, then we expect there to be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence, demand and spending and, as a result, our business.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P52_S7	We will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P52_S8	Our Venezuelan subsidiary has been operating in a highly inflationary economy since January 2010.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	In February 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency, the bolivar fuerte.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	This devaluation did not have a significant impact on our business or our consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	We do not expect this devaluation to have a significant impact on our ongoing future consolidated net sales or operating income.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	However, any further devaluation could have a negative effect on our local business.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	We plan to continue to invest in the significant modernization of our global information systems, which includes the Strategic Modernization Initiative ( SMI ) as well as other initiatives.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	As part of SMI, we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to SAP-based technologies, with the majority of our locations being enabled through calendar 2014.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	During the fiscal 2013 third quarter SMI implementation of the global supply planning component, challenges emerged which caused some customer service delays and certain products to be out of stock.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	As a result, we decided to defer the previously scheduled January 2014 SMI implementation by six months.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	Subsequently, we resolved the SMI-related challenges, so that customer service delays and products out of stock related to this rollout have improved as expected.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	These challenges did not have a significant impact on our business or our consolidated financial results for the year ended June 30, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P55_S4	We expect our initiatives should over time provide for overall profitability improvements by enhancing gross margin and supporting efficiencies in select operating expenses, which should enable us to strategically reinvest our savings in activities that will support our future growth.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Looking ahead to fiscal 2014, we plan to continue building on our strengths and our heritage of innovation to bring unique and high-performance products with long-term appeal and enduring quality to our consumers.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	We expect our strategy will enable us to continue to succeed in high growth channels, benefit from regional opportunities, focus on emerging market consumers and enhance our local relevance.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	We plan on continuing to bring highly innovative products to consumers and elevating our personalized High-Touch philosophy through customization with key retailers, expansion in freestanding stores and extending it to fast-growing digital platforms.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P56_S3	We remain dedicated to investing in select areas to improve our capabilities or develop new ones.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P56_S4	Our main focuses are accelerating our digital capabilities, research and development, product innovation, consumer insight and local relevance.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Returns and Charges Associated with Restructuring Activities In an effort to drive down costs and achieve synergies within our organization, in February 2009, we announced the implementation of a multi-faceted cost savings program (the Program ) to position the Company to achieve long-term profitable growth.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	We anticipated the Program would result in total cumulative restructuring charges and other costs to implement those initiatives of between $350 million and $450 million before taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we closed the Program.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P57_S3	We concluded the approval of all initiatives under the Program and anticipate commencing the execution of those initiatives through fiscal 2014.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P57_S4	As a result of the closure of the Program and evaluation of the initiatives that have been implemented, as of June 30, 2013, we anticipate total cumulative restructuring charges and other costs to implement those initiatives to total between $320 million and $330 million and that such charges have been substantially recorded through fiscal 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P57_S5	We will continue to monitor the progress of these initiatives and revise estimates as appropriate.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	The following is a reconciliation of cumulative approved charges under the Program as compared with the revised estimated charges related to initiatives under the Program and total cumulative charges incurred through June 30, 2013:
1001250_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	We estimate that the implementation of this Program, combined with other on-going cost savings efforts, resulted in savings of approximately $780 million through the end of fiscal 2013 which included the reduction of certain costs relative to an assumed normalized spending pattern.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	Any changes from adjustments of estimated costs, as referenced above, have been included within our estimated savings.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	Our long-range forecast for operating margin reflects these anticipated savings, net of strategic reinvestments.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Program focused on a redesign of our organizational structure in order to integrate the Company in a more cohesive way and operate more globally across brands and functions.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	The principal aspect of the Program was the reduction of the workforce by approximately 2,000 employees.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	Specific actions taken since Program inception included:
1001250_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Resize and Reorganize the Organization We continued the realignment and optimization of our organization to better leverage scale, improve productivity, reduce complexity and achieve cost savings in each region and across various functions.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	This included reduction of the workforce which occurred through the consolidation of certain functions, which we achieved through a combination of normal attrition and job eliminations, and the closure and consolidation of certain distribution and office facilities.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	As of June 30, 2013, we identified approximately $14 million of previously-approved restructuring costs that will not be incurred related to these activities, primarily as a result of certain employees relocating to other available positions within the Company.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Turnaround or Exit Unprofitable Operations To improve the profitability in certain of our brands and regions, we have selectively exited certain channels of distribution, categories and markets, and have made changes to turn around others.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	This included the exit from the global wholesale distribution of our Prescriptives brand, the reformulation of Ojon brand products and the exit from the global distribution of Sean John products.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	In connection with these activities, we incurred charges for product returns, inventory write-offs, reduction of workforce and termination of contracts.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P62_S3	As of June 30, 2013, we identified approximately $21 million of previously-approved returns and other costs related to these activities that will not be incurred, primarily as a result of better-than-expected sales of products prior to the exit of the operations, as well as lower employee-related and store closure costs than originally estimated.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Outsourcing In order to balance the growing need for information technology support with our efforts to provide the most efficient and cost effective solutions, we continued the outsourcing of certain information technology processes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	We incurred costs to transition services to outsource providers and employee-related termination costs.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	As of June 30, 2013, we identified approximately $26 million of previously-approved outsourcing initiatives for information technology services stemming from the decision not to implement certain aspects of these initiatives, as well as lower costs than originally anticipated to transition services on initiatives that were implemented.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	The following table presents aggregate restructuring charges related to the Program to date:
1001250_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	The following table presents accrued restructuring charges and the related activities under the Program to date:
1001250_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Accrued restructuring charges at June 30, 2013 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately $23 million in fiscal 2014 and $5 million in fiscal 2015.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	The following table presents total returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities related to the Program:
1001250_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	During fiscal 2013, we recorded $1.5 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $0.2 million) and a write-off of inventory of $1.4 million associated with exiting unprofitable operations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	During fiscal 2012, we recorded $2.1 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $0.3 million) and a write-off of inventory of $1.8 million associated with exiting unprofitable operations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	During fiscal 2011, we recorded $4.6 million reflecting sales returns (less related cost of sales of $1.2 million) and a write-off of inventory of $7.0 million associated with turnaround operations, primarily related to the reformulation of Ojon brand products.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	Other charges in connection with the implementation of the Program primarily relate to consulting and other professional services.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairments As of our annual step-one goodwill impairment test on April 1, 2013, all reporting units fair values substantially exceeded their respective carrying values, with the exception of our Darphin reporting unit.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	As a result, we recorded an impairment charge for the remainder of the goodwill related to the Darphin reporting unit of $9.6 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	The fair value of the reporting unit was based upon the income approach, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	As of our annual indefinite-lived asset impairment test on April 1, 2013, the fair values of all other indefinite-lived intangible assets substantially exceeded their respective carrying values, with the exception of our Darphin trademark.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	We determined that the carrying value of this trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P73_S3	As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $8.1 million for the remaining carrying value of the related trademark.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P73_S4	These impairment charges were reflected in the skin care product category and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa region.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	We will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of the volatility of global economic conditions and uncertainties on our business and on our annual impairment testing.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	Accordingly, it is possible that we could recognize an impairment charge in the future with respect to goodwill, other intangible assets and/or long-lived assets.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Net sales increased 5%, or $468.1 million, to $10,181.7 million, reflecting growth in all of our major product categories within each geographic region.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 6%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The following discussions of Net Sales by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of $1.5 million and $2.1 million recorded during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	We believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 6%, or $240.1 million, to $4,465.3 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	The recent launches of Perfectionist CP+R, Advanced Time Zone, Advanced Night Repair Eye Serum Infusion and the Optimizer line of products from Est e Lauder contributed approximately $273 million, combined, to the increase.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	Also contributing approximately $99 million, combined, to the increase were the recent launches of The Moisturizing Soft Cream from La Mer and Even Better Eyes Dark Circle Corrector from Clinique.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P78_S3	Serum and Time Zone, as well as Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator, which was a new launch in the prior year, from Est e Lauder of approximately $162 million, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P78_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 7%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	Makeup Makeup net sales increased 5%, or $180.1 million, to $3,876.9 million, primarily reflecting an increase in net sales from our makeup artist brands of approximately $156 million, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	The recent launches of High Impact Extreme Volume Mascara and Chubby Stick Intense from Clinique and Pure Color Vivid Shine Lipstick from Est e Lauder contributed approximately $47 million of incremental sales, combined to the increase.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of Repairwear Laser Focus Makeup from Clinique and Pure Color Eyeshadow and Doublewear Stay-In-Place Makeup from Est e Lauder, all of which were new launches in the prior year, of approximately $45 million, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P79_S3	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 6%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products increased 3%, or $39.8 million, to $1,310.8 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	So Intense, Tommy Hilfiger Freedom Men and Coach Love contributed approximately $30 million, combined, to the increase.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	Higher sales of Jo Malone and Tom Ford fragrances contributed approximately $60 million, combined, to the increase.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Est e Lauder Sensuous Nude and DKNY Golden Delicious, both of which were new launches in the prior year, as well as pureDKNY, of approximately $52 million, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P80_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased 4%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 6%, or $26.5 million, to $488.9 million, primarily reflecting the continued success of the Invati line of products and recent launches of Pure Abundance Style Prep and Be Curly Curl Controller from Aveda.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	The category also benefited from sales generated from expanded global distribution, in particular, to salons for Aveda and multi-brand specialty retailers for Bumble and bumble.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of Bumble and bumble brand products to salons and lower net sales of Ojon brand products due, in part, to a reduction in our business in the DRTV channel.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P81_S3	The impact of foreign currency translation on hair care net sales was de minimis.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	Net sales in the Americas increased 5%, or $201.8 million, to $4,302.9 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	The increase during the current year was primarily attributable to growth in the United States of approximately $172 million, due in large part to product offerings from our heritage and makeup artist brands.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	Net sales in Canada increased approximately $13 million, primarily reflecting increased sales from certain of our heritage brands as a result of expanded distribution.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P82_S3	These increases also reflect the efforts of our expanded pull/push activities, which include innovative advertising that continues to draw new consumers to our brands and our ongoing efforts to work with retailers in the United States and Canada on strengthening the High-Touch concepts used to help market our products.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	We are cautious of a slowing retail environment in the United States in the short term.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Net sales in Latin America increased approximately $19 million, led by Venezuela and Mexico.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in the Americas was de minimis.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, net sales increased 4%, or $155.5 million, to $3,758.7 million, primarily reflecting higher sales from our travel retail business and in the United Kingdom and the Middle East of approximately $185 million, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	The net sales increase in our travel retail business primarily reflected a strong retail environment for our products, new product launches and, to a lesser extent, an increase in global airline passenger traffic.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	Higher sales in the United Kingdom were primarily driven by our makeup artist brands and new product launches from certain of our heritage brands.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	In addition, the United Kingdom benefited from increased sales of certain of our luxury fragrance and skin care products.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P85_S4	Higher sales in the Middle East were primarily driven by our makeup artist brands and sales of luxury fragrances.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P85_S5	These increases in the region were partially offset by lower net sales in Spain, Russia, Switzerland and the Balkans of approximately $45 million, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P85_S6	With the exception of Russia, these lower net sales reflected the challenging economic environments in certain countries in Europe.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P85_S7	Accordingly, we remain cautious in the near term.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	The lower net sales in Russia primarily reflected destocking associated with ongoing challenges with a certain customer.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	The overall change in Europe, the Middle East Africa net sales was inclusive of unfavorable exchange rates due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies in this region of approximately $75 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East Africa increased 6%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 5%, or $110.2 million, to $2,121.6 million, primarily reflecting growth in our sales of skin care products, in line with our strategy.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	We increased sales by approximately $160 million in China and Hong Kong.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	Net sales in China benefited from expanded distribution.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P87_S3	While we gained share in the prestige business in China, we are cautious that a slowing of the future growth trend of the Chinese economy may temper our retail sales growth, including that of our travel retail business.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P87_S4	Higher sales in Hong Kong were primarily driven by launches from our heritage brands and higher-end prestige skin care products.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P87_S5	These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in Korea and Japan of approximately $66 million, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P87_S6	The lower net sales in Korea primarily reflected a challenging economic environment and continued competitive pressures facing prestige beauty in Korea.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	The decline in Japan was driven by the weakening of the Japanese yen.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 6%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 19.9% as compared with 20.5% in the prior year.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	This improvement reflected changes in the mix of our business and pricing of approximately 40 basis points, favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 20 basis points and the favorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	These improvements were partially offset by a provision for foreign transactional taxes of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of potential new brands or channels of distribution that have margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 65.1% as compared with 66.0% in the prior year.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	This improvement reflected a decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales of approximately 50 basis points, a decrease in charges associated with restructuring activities of approximately 40 basis points and lower selling and shipping costs as a percentage of net sales of 10 basis points.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	Also included in this improvement was a favorable change in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points and lower charges associated with other intangible asset impairments of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	Partially offsetting these improvements were higher costs related to stock-based compensation of approximately 20 basis points and increased spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling in line with our strategy of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	Operating income increased 16%, or $214.3 million, to $1,526.0 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	Operating margin increased to 15.0% of net sales as compared with 13.5% in the prior year, reflecting our higher gross margin and the decrease in our operating expense margin, as previously discussed.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of $17.8 million, or 0.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2013 and $63.2 million, or 0.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	We believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	Skin care operating income increased 11%, or $83.4 million, to $830.1 million, primarily reflecting improved results from higher-margin product launches from Est e Lauder and La Mer, partially offset by goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $17.7 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	Makeup operating income increased 8%, or $42.4 million, to $580.4 million, primarily reflecting improved results from our M A C brand, partially offset by certain of our heritage brands and an increase in investment spending in line with our strategy.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P96_S2	Fragrance operating income increased 20%, or $20.2 million, to $120.3 million, primarily reflecting increased profitability from certain Jo Malone, Est e Lauder and Clinique products, partially offset by lower results from certain of our designer fragrances.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P96_S3	Hair care operating results increased over 100%, or $14.5 million, to $26.7 million, due to a favorable comparison to the prior year which was impacted by other intangible asset impairment charges of $21.7 million, partially offset by lower sales of Bumble and bumble brand products and higher investment spending by Aveda to support the Invati line of products.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	Operating income in the Americas increased 47%, or $134.8 million, to $423.2 million, primarily reflecting improved results from our makeup artist and luxury brands and certain of our hair care and heritage brands, driven by improved category mix, partially offset by the timing and level of strategic investment spending in the current year.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, operating income increased 9%, or $67.1 million, to $813.4 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	Higher results from our travel retail business, the Middle East and the United Kingdom totaled approximately $77 million, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P98_S2	Partially offsetting these improvements were lower results in Germany and Spain of approximately $5 million, combined, as well as goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $17.7 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	In Asia/Pacific, operating income decreased 10%, or $33.0 million, to $307.2 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	Higher results from China and Thailand totaled approximately $22 million, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	These higher results were more than offset by lower operating results of approximately $51 million in Korea, Hong Kong and Japan, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P99_S3	The lower results in Hong Kong were due in part to investment spending to support new product launches.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	Net interest expense was $54.8 million as compared with $61.1 million in the prior year.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	Interest expense decreased primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower rates.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we redeemed the $230.1 million principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2013 at a price of 108% of the principal amount.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	In December 2012, we amended the agreement related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields (a brand then owned by us) to receive a fixed amount in lieu of future contingent consideration and other rights.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	Accordingly, we recognized $22.4 million, net of discount of $0.4 million, which has been classified as other income in our consolidated statements of earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	Prior to this amendment, we earned and received $0.7 million of contingent consideration.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	In November 2011, we settled a commercial dispute with third parties that was outside our normal operations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	In connection therewith, we received a $10.5 million cash payment, which has been classified as other income in our consolidated statement of earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 30.6% as compared with 31.8% in the prior year.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	The decrease in the effective income tax rate of 120 basis points was principally due to a decrease in the effective tax rate of our foreign operations as compared with the prior year, as well as the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit signed into law on January 2, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

1001250_13_ITEM7_P116_S2	Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of Ojon brand products due, in part, to softness in our business in the DRTV channel.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P116_S3	The impact of foreign currency translation on hair care net sales was de minimis.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	Net sales in the Americas increased 8%, or $304.8 million, to $4,101.1 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P117_S1	The increase in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to growth in the United States of approximately $257 million, primarily due to new product offerings from our heritage and makeup artist brands, as well as an increase in sales of our higher-end prestige skin care products.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P117_S2	These increases reflect, in part, our ongoing efforts to work with retailers in the U.S. department store channel on strengthening the High-Touch concepts used to help market our products.

1001250_13_ITEM7_P119_S4	The growth in the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy was primarily attributable to successful launches of skin care and makeup products from certain of our heritage brands, as well as higher combined sales from our makeup artist brands.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P119_S5	Net sales in the Middle East benefited from a new fragrance launch designed specifically for consumers there, in line with our strategy to be locally relevant.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P119_S6	These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in Russia, Spain and the Balkans of approximately $25 million, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P119_S7	The lower net sales in Russia primarily reflected destocking associated with ongoing challenges with a certain customer.

1001250_13_ITEM7_P120_S2	Our businesses in Japan, Korea and Australia continued to be challenged due to difficult economic conditions, but we reported net sales gains of approximately $37 million, combined, which for both Japan and Australia were generated predominantly from the strengthening of their respective currencies.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P120_S3	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 11%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 20.5% as compared with 22.0% in fiscal 2011.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P122_S1	This improvement primarily reflected our efforts in connection with the Program, including strategic changes in the mix of our business and pricing of approximately 140 basis points, favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 10 basis points and the favorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P122_S2	These improvements were partially offset by an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 66.0% as compared with 65.6% in fiscal 2011.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P123_S1	This change reflected increased spending in advertising, merchandising and sampling costs in line with our strategy of approximately 80 basis points, higher costs related to stock-based compensation of approximately 20 basis points, an increase in general and administrative costs of approximately 10 basis points and higher charges associated with restructuring activities of approximately 10 basis points.

1001250_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	Operating margin increased to 13.5% of net sales as compared with 12.4% in fiscal 2011, reflecting our higher gross margin, partially offset by the increase in our operating expense margin, as previously discussed.

1001250_13_ITEM7_P127_S2	Both our skin care and makeup categories were impacted by higher investment spending on global advertising, merchandising and sampling to support major launches and existing franchises in line with our strategy.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P127_S3	Fragrance operating income increased 24%, or $19.4 million, to $100.1 million, primarily reflecting improved cost of goods and a more strategically focused approach to spending from our heritage brands as part of our strategy to improve profitability.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P127_S4	Hair care operating results increased over 100%, or $21.3 million, to $12.2 million, primarily reflecting expanded global distribution, improved results driven by new product launches, as well as a favorable comparison to fiscal 2011 which was impacted by higher goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $15 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	Operating income in the Americas increased 18%, or $43.5 million, to $288.4 million, primarily reflecting improved results from our heritage and makeup artist brands that were driven by improved category mix, as well as a favorable comparison to fiscal 2011 which was impacted by higher goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $16 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P128_S1	Partially offsetting these improvements was the level of strategic investment spending in fiscal 2012.

1001250_13_ITEM7_P129_S3	The lower results in Russia primarily reflected strategic investment spending to support this emerging market, coupled with a decrease in sales as a result of destocking associated with ongoing challenges with a certain customer.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P129_S4	The lower results in France primarily reflected strategic investment spending.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 35%, or $88.2 million, to $340.2 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P130_S1	Most countries in the region reported higher operating results, led by approximately $70 million in Hong Kong, China, Japan and Korea, combined.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	Net interest expense was $61.1 million as compared with $63.9 million in fiscal 2011.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P131_S1	Interest expense decreased due to the replacement of our 6.00% Senior Notes in January 2012 with commercial paper.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P132_S1	The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P132_S2	Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 31.8% as compared with 31.4% in fiscal 2011.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P133_S1	The increase in the effective income tax rate of 40 basis points was principally due to a decrease in favorable tax reserve adjustments as compared with fiscal 2011 partially offset by a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. as compared with fiscal 2011 increased 22%, or $156.1 million, to $856.9 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased 24% from $1.74 to $2.16.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P135_S1	The results in fiscal 2012 include the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of $44.1 million, after tax, or $.11 per diluted common share.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P135_S2	The results in fiscal 2011 include the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of $41.7 million, after tax, or $.10 per diluted common share.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P136_S0	Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P136_S1	At June 30, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,495.7 million compared with $1,347.7 million at June 30, 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P136_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P136_S3	As of June 30, 2013, less than 1% of the total balance was insured by governmental agencies, reflecting the expiration of temporary unlimited deposit insurance provided in the United States.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P137_S0	To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P138_S0	Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P138_S1	From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P138_S2	To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P139_S1	Our cash and cash equivalents balance at June 30, 2013 includes approximately $871 million of cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P139_S2	We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P139_S3	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P140_S0	The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P140_S1	Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P141_S0	Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P141_S1	Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P141_S2	Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P142_S1	As of August 19, 2013, our commercial paper is rated A-1 by Standard Poor s and P-1 by Moody s and our long-term debt is rated A with a stable outlook by Standard Poor s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody s.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	At June 30, 2013, our outstanding borrowings were as follows:

1001250_13_ITEM7_P144_S5	(6) As of June 30, 2013, we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants, including limitations on indebtedness and liens, and expect continued compliance.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	In August 2012, we issued $250.0 million of 2.35% Senior Notes due August 15, 2022 ( 2022 Senior Notes ) and $250.0 million of 3.70% Senior Notes due August 15, 2042 ( 2042 Senior Notes ) in a public offering.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P145_S1	The 2022 Senior Notes were priced at 99.911% with a yield of 2.360%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P145_S2	The 2042 Senior Notes were priced at 99.567% with a yield of 3.724%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P145_S3	Interest payments on both notes are required to be made semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we used the net proceeds of the offering to redeem the $230.1 million principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due November 1, 2013 at a price of 108% of the principal amount and recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P146_S1	We used the remaining net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	We have a commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P147_S1	In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we increased the limit of this program from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P147_S2	In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we had repaid, using cash on hand, $200.0 million of commercial paper that was outstanding at June 30, 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P147_S3	At June 30, 2013, we had no commercial paper outstanding.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	We have a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on July 14, 2015 (the Facility ).
1001250_13_ITEM7_P148_S1	The Facility may be used to provide credit support for our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P148_S2	Up to the equivalent of $250 million of the Facility is available for multi-currency loans.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P148_S3	The interest rate on borrowings under the Facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or % plus the Federal funds rate.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P148_S4	We incurred costs of approximately $1 million to establish the Facility which are being amortized over the term of the Facility.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P148_S5	The Facility has an annual fee of $0.7 million, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P148_S6	The Facility also contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $100.0 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P148_S7	At June 30, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	We have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to $150.0 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in Europe.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P149_S1	The interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an all-in fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P149_S2	At June 30, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P149_S3	Debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P150_S0	We have borrowing agreements with two financial institutions pursuant to which our subsidiary in Turkey may borrow up to 50.0 million Turkish lira ($26.0 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2013).
1001250_13_ITEM7_P150_S1	The interest rate on borrowings under these agreements was approximately 7%.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P150_S2	There were no debt issuance costs incurred related to these agreements.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P150_S3	The outstanding balance at June 30, 2013 was 14.1 million Turkish lira ($7.4 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2013) and is classified as current debt in our consolidated balance sheet.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P151_S0	Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) was 29% at June 30, 2013 and 32% at June 30, 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P152_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,226.3 million, $1,126.7 million and $1,027.0 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P152_S1	The increase in cash flows from operating activities as compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, a decrease in pension and post-retirement benefit contributions and a favorable change in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments and collections.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P152_S2	These improvements were partially offset by an increase in the levels of inventory, primarily to maintain acceptable service levels in line with forecasted sales activity, as well as for the remaining safety stock for the SMI implementation.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P152_S3	Also offsetting these improvements were a change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments, and a decrease in accrued income taxes, resulting from the timing and level of tax payments.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P152_S4	Cash flows from operating activities increased in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, favorable levels of accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments, and a decrease in the levels of inventory.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P152_S5	These improvements were partially offset by the change in other liabilities, primarily due to the timing of payments and costs related to employee compensation, advertising, merchandising and sampling, and payroll and other taxes, as well as an increase in accounts receivable balances primarily due to the timing of shipments.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P153_S0	Net cash used for investing activities was $465.5 million, $428.3 million and $606.9 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P153_S1	The increase in cash flows used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2012 primarily reflected higher capital expenditure activity in the current year related to counters and leasehold improvements.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P153_S2	The decrease in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily reflected a favorable comparison with the fiscal 2011 acquisition of Smashbox Cosmetics, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures for counters and leasehold improvements.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P154_S0	Net cash used for financing activities was $611.5 million, $585.1 million and $313.1 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P154_S1	The increase in cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2012 primarily reflected the repayment of outstanding commercial paper during the current year, higher dividends paid as a result of the increase in the annual dividend rate and transition to a quarterly dividend payout schedule, and higher redemptions of long-term debt during the current year, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Senior Notes and 2042 Senior Notes in August 2012 and lower treasury stock repurchases.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P154_S2	The change in net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases, lower net proceeds from employee stock transactions and an increase in the payment of dividends during fiscal 2012 as a result of an increase in the annual dividend rate.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P154_S3	The repayment of the 2012 Senior Notes during fiscal 2012 was offset by proceeds from the issuance of short-term commercial paper.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P154_S4	Subsequent to June 30, 2013, we purchased approximately 0.6 million additional shares of Class A Common Stock for $41.8 million pursuant to our share repurchase program.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P155_S0	We transitioned to a quarterly dividend payout schedule for our Class A and Class B Common Stock beginning in the fiscal 2013 third quarter.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P156_S0	The following is a summary of cash dividends declared per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during the year ended June 30, 2013:
1001250_13_ITEM7_P157_S0	On August 14, 2013, a dividend was declared in the amount of $.18 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P157_S1	The dividend is payable in cash on September 16, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 30, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P158_S0	Several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P158_S1	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P158_S2	Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ( ERISA ) and subsequent pension legislation, and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P159_S0	For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P159_S1	In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in Item 7.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P160_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P160_S1	The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P161_S0	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P161_S1	This strategy assisted in maintaining a funded ratio of more than 100% as of June 30, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P161_S2	For fiscal 2013 and 2012, we met or exceeded all minimum contributions required by ERISA for the U.S. Qualified Plan.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P161_S3	For fiscal 2013, minimum contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan required by ERISA were satisfied by using a portion of the credit balance.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P161_S4	Credit balances occur when contributions to the plan exceed the minimum required by ERISA.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P161_S5	In fiscal 2012, we made discretionary payments of $75.6 million to the U.S. Qualified Plan and $9.4 million to our U.S. post-retirement medical plan.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P161_S6	As we continue to monitor the performance of our plan assets, we may decide to make discretionary cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement plan in the United States during fiscal 2014, but do not have plans to do so at this time.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P162_S0	For fiscal 2013 and 2012, we made benefit payments under our non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of $6.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P162_S1	We expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2014 of approximately $12.1 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P162_S2	For fiscal 2013 and 2012, we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of $25.9 million and $29.7 million, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P162_S3	We expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2014 of approximately $29.2 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P163_S0	Certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn-out provisions.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P163_S1	These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P163_S2	Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P164_S0	For additional contingencies refer to Item 3.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P165_S0	The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of June 30, 2013:
1001250_13_ITEM7_P166_S0	(1) Includes long-term and current debt and the related projected interest costs, and to a lesser extent, capital lease commitments.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P166_S1	Interest costs on long-term and current debt are projected to be $61.3 million in each of the years from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2017, $44.6 million in fiscal 2018 and $773.3 million thereafter.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P166_S2	Projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P167_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 9 Debt .
1001250_13_ITEM7_P167_S1	(2) Minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P168_S0	Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, as well as common area maintenance.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P168_S1	These amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P168_S2	(3) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments, estimated future earn-out payments, estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements, advertising commitments, capital improvement commitments, planned funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements, obligations related to our cost savings initiatives and acquisitions.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P168_S3	Future earn-out payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2013, without consideration for potential renewal periods.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P169_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Income Taxes for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P169_S1	As of June 30, 2013, the noncurrent portion of our unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties was $80.5 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P169_S2	At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P170_S0	We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P170_S1	We enter into foreign currency forward contracts.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P170_S2	We may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P170_S3	We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P171_S0	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P171_S1	Costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to our consolidated financial results.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P172_S0	For each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain hedge accounting treatment, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P173_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P173_S1	We also formally assess, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P173_S2	If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P174_S0	We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with our identified exposures.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P174_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P175_S0	The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P175_S1	We may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P175_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of March 2015.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P175_S3	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P175_S4	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P175_S5	The ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P175_S6	For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P175_S7	If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to current-period earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P175_S8	As of June 30, 2013, these foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective in all material respects.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P176_S0	At June 30, 2013, we had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,579.6 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P176_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound ($426.2 million), Euro ($268.8 million), Canadian dollar ($198.6 million), Swiss franc ($111.5 million), Australian dollar ($92.1 million), Thailand baht ($75.5 million) and Hong Kong dollar ($58.1 million).
1001250_13_ITEM7_P177_S0	As a matter of policy, we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P177_S1	The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P177_S2	Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $21.7 million at June 30, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P177_S3	To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P177_S4	Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P178_S0	Certain of our derivative financial instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P178_S1	At June 30, 2013, we were in a net asset position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features with two counterparties.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P178_S2	The fair value of those contracts as of June 30, 2013 was approximately $4.6 million.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P178_S3	As of June 30, 2013, we were in compliance with such credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P179_S0	We use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P179_S1	Value-at-risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P179_S2	We estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250-day period.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P179_S3	The high, low and average measured value-at-risk during fiscal 2013 related to our foreign exchange contracts is as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM7_P180_S0	The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P181_S0	We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P181_S1	Our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P181_S2	It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P181_S3	We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
1001250_13_ITEM7_P182_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	Under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ( fair-value hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( foreign currency cash-flow hedge), or (iii) not designated as a hedging instrument.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P79_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge that is highly effective are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments).
1001250_13_ITEM15_P79_S3	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a foreign currency cash-flow hedge of a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in OCI.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P79_S4	Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).
1001250_13_ITEM15_P79_S5	Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P85_S1	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company s operating segments.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P86_S2	The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P86_S3	The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P86_S4	Impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) the Company determines impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P87_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, impairment is recorded.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	Testing goodwill for impairment requires the Company to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P89_S1	The assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company uses industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and, in certain instances, the Company engages third-party valuation specialists for advice.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P90_S1	To determine fair value of the reporting unit, the Company generally uses an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P90_S2	In certain circumstances, equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable (e.g., only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins).
1001250_13_ITEM15_P90_S3	The Company believes both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P91_S1	Under the market approach, the Company utilizes information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, to value the reporting unit.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P91_S2	The key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	To determine fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company uses an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P92_S1	This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P92_S2	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P92_S3	Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P93_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P93_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	Domestic and international sales are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries and specialty retailers.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P94_S2	The Company grants credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company s largest customer sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for $1,078.8 million, or 11%, $1,048.1 million, or 11%, and $967.6 million, or 11%, of the Company s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P95_S1	This customer accounted for $113.7 million, or 10%, and $110.2 million, or 10%, of the Company s accounts receivable at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P96_S2	In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at the Company s retail stores.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company records revenues generated from purchase with purchase promotions in Net Sales and costs of its purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions in Cost of Sales.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P98_S1	The Company s practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P98_S2	In accepting returns, the Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P98_S3	As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.3% in 2013 and 3.5% in fiscal 2012 and 2011.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	Certain incentive arrangements require the payment of a fee to customers based on their attainment of pre-established sales levels.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P100_S1	These fees have been recorded as a reduction of Net Sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were not material to the results of operations in any period presented.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Company enters into transactions related to advertising, product promotions and demonstrations, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P101_S2	The Company s share of the cost of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were approximately $1,412 million, $1,343 million and $1,152 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development costs were $2,798.0 million, $2,655.7 million and $2,345.8 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are expensed as incurred.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P102_S1	Excluding the impact of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions, advertising, merchandising, sampling and promotion expenses included in operating expenses were $2,584.2 million, $2,458.9 million and $2,160.7 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	Research and development costs amounted to $103.6 million, $96.5 million and $85.7 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P103_S1	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	Shipping and handling expenses of $337.9 million, $312.4 million and $289.7 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and include distribution center costs, third-party logistics costs and outbound freight.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P105_S1	The Company considers lease renewals when such renewals are reasonably assured.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding from its lessors.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P106_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as a reduction of rent expense.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	The Company s license agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors trademarks.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P107_S1	The licenses typically have an initial term of approximately 5 years to 11 years, and are renewable subject to the Company s compliance with the license agreement provisions.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P107_S2	The remaining terms, including the potential renewal periods, range from approximately 7 years to 28 years.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	Most of the Company s licenses were entered into to create new business.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P109_S1	In some cases, the Company acquired, or entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a pre-existing beauty products business.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P109_S2	In those cases, other intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P110_S1	Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the award, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	Upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock units, performance share units, performance share units based on total stockholder return and market share units, the resulting excess tax benefits, if any, are credited to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P112_S2	Any resulting tax deficiencies will first be offset against those cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P112_S3	If the cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital are exhausted, tax deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P112_S4	Excess tax benefits are required to be reflected as financing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P113_S1	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P113_S2	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P113_S3	Based on the Company s assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	If the Company determines that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P115_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P115_S2	The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P115_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P115_S4	For those tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P116_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P116_S2	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P117_S0	In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended its authoritative guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P117_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P117_S2	If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more-likely-than-not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P117_S3	This guidance became effective in the beginning of the Company s fiscal 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P117_S4	The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P118_S0	In June 2011, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income, requiring entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P118_S1	This guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P118_S2	In December 2011, the FASB issued an update to this guidance deferring the requirement to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P118_S3	However, the Company is still required to present reclassification adjustments on either the face of the financial statement where comprehensive income is reported or disclose the reclassification adjustments in the notes to the financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P118_S4	This guidance, including the deferral, became effective for the Company s fiscal 2013 first quarter, with full retrospective application required.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	The Company has elected to present the items of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate consecutive statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P119_S1	The adoption of this disclosure-only guidance did not have an impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P121_S1	If either (i) an NOL carryforward, a similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward is not available as of the reporting date under the governing tax law to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position or (ii) the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose (provided that the tax law permits a choice), an entity should present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P121_S2	This guidance becomes effective prospectively for unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the Company s fiscal 2015 first quarter, with retrospective application and early adoption permitted.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P121_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the impact of this balance sheet presentation guidance but does not expect it to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P122_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to resolve the diversity in practice concerning the release of the cumulative translation adjustment ( CTA ) into net income (i) when a parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity, and (ii) in connection with a step acquisition of a foreign entity.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P122_S1	This amended guidance requires that CTA be released in net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided, and that a pro rata portion of the CTA be released into net income upon a partial sale of an equity method investment in a foreign entity only.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P122_S2	In addition, the amended guidance clarifies the definition of a sale of an investment in a foreign entity to include both, events that result in the loss of a controlling financial interest in a foreign entity and events that result in an acquirer obtaining control of an acquiree in which it held an equity interest immediately prior to the date of acquisition.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P122_S3	The CTA should be released into net income upon the occurrence of such events.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P122_S4	This guidance becomes effective prospectively for the Company s fiscal 2015 first quarter with early adoption permitted.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P122_S5	The Company will apply this new guidance when it becomes effective, and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P123_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligations within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P123_S1	It does not apply to certain obligations that are addressed within existing guidance in U.S. GAAP.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	This guidance requires an entity to measure in-scope obligations with joint and several liability (e.g., debt arrangements, other contractual obligations, settled litigations, judicial rulings) as the sum of the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and any additional amount it expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P124_S1	In addition, an entity is required to disclose the nature and amount of the obligation.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P124_S2	This guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods for those obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements within the scope of this guidance that exist at the beginning of the Company s fiscal 2015 first quarter, with early adoption permitted.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P124_S3	The Company will apply this guidance when it becomes effective, and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P125_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring an entity to present, in a single location either parenthetically on the face of the financial statements or in a separate note, significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P125_S1	An entity is not permitted to provide this information parenthetically on the face of the income statement if it has items that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P125_S2	Instead of disclosing the income statement line affected, a cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details on these items is required.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P125_S3	This guidance becomes effective prospectively for the Company s fiscal 2014 first quarter, with early adoption permitted.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P125_S4	The Company will apply this new guidance when it becomes effective, and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P126_S0	In July 2012, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P126_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing their indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing further impairment testing.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P126_S2	If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that it is more-likely-than-not that the asset is impaired, a quantitative test is required.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P126_S3	The guidance becomes effective in the beginning of the Company s fiscal 2014, with early adoption permitted.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P126_S4	The Company will apply this new guidance when it becomes effective, and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P127_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that creates new disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity s rights of offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P128_S1	This revised guidance helps reconcile differences in the offsetting requirements under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ).
1001250_13_ITEM15_P128_S2	These requirements mandate that entities disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P128_S3	In January 2013, the FASB issued an update that limits the scope of these disclosures to recognized derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions to the extent they are offset in the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P128_S4	This disclosure-only guidance becomes effective for the Company s fiscal 2014 first quarter, with retrospective application required.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P128_S5	The Company currently does not hold any financial or derivative instruments within the scope of this guidance that are offset in its consolidated balance sheets or are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P128_S6	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, but may require certain additional disclosures if the Company enters into additional arrangements that fall under the scope of this guidance.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P129_S0	During the year ended June 30, 2013, the Company identified and recorded out-of-period adjustments related to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 through June 30, 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P130_S0	During the three months ended September 30, 2012, these out-of-period adjustments resulted in a net decrease in earnings before taxes of $5.9 million, a decrease in net earnings of $7.4 million and a decrease in diluted net earnings per common share of $.02.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P130_S1	These out-of-period adjustments resulted from an understatement of foreign transactional taxes (no impact on the provision for income taxes), an overstatement of accounts payable balances and an overstatement of prepaid asset balances.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P131_S0	During the three months ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded an additional out-of-period adjustment related to the overstatement of accounts payable balances.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P131_S1	This adjustment resulted in an increase in earnings before taxes of $13.6 million, an increase in net earnings of $9.1 million and an increase in diluted net earnings per common share of $.02 for the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P132_S0	The impact of these adjustments for the year ended June 30, 2013 is an increase in earnings before taxes of $7.7 million, an increase in net earnings of $1.7 million and no change in diluted net earnings per common share.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P133_S0	Individually and in the aggregate, these out-of-period adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2013, and the related items were not material to any previously issued consolidated financial statements.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P136_S1	The following table presents goodwill by product category and the related change in the carrying amount:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P137_S0	Other intangible assets include trademarks and patents, as well as license agreements and other intangible assets resulting from or related to businesses and assets purchased by the Company.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P137_S1	Indefinite-lived intangible assets (e.g., trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are assessed at least annually for impairment during the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P137_S2	Other intangible assets (e.g., non-compete agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately 2 years to 20 years.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	Intangible assets related to license agreements were amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on the terms of the respective agreements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	The costs incurred and expensed by the Company to extend or renew the term of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2013 and 2012 were not significant to the Company s results of operations.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P141_S0	Other intangible assets consist of the following:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	The aggregate amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $12.5 million, $13.9 million and $14.6 million, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P142_S1	The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	As of the Company s annual step-one goodwill impairment test on April 1, 2013, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Darphin reporting unit exceeded its fair value.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P143_S1	As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge for the remainder of the goodwill related to the Darphin reporting unit of $9.6 million.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	The fair value of the reporting unit was based upon the income approach, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P144_S1	The Company also determined that the carrying value of the Darphin trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the use of a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows ( relief-from-royalty method ).
1001250_13_ITEM15_P144_S2	As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $8.1 million for the remaining carrying value of the related trademark.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P144_S3	These impairment charges were reflected in the skin care product category and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa region.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Ojon reporting unit identified a potential decline in its projected results of operations, primarily resulting from a softness in the direct response television channel, which caused the Company to review and revise Ojon s long-term forecast.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P145_S1	The Company concluded that these changes in the business of the Ojon reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment test of its trademarks as of December 31, 2011.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P145_S2	These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amount of the customer list may not be recoverable.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P145_S3	The Company performed an interim impairment test for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the customer list as of December 31, 2011.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P145_S4	For the trademarks, the Company concluded that the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P145_S5	As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $6.7 million.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P145_S6	This charge was reflected in the hair care product category and in the Americas region.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P145_S7	The Company concluded that the carrying value of the customer list was recoverable.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	As of the Company s annual indefinite-lived asset impairment test on April 1, 2012, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Ojon brand trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P146_S1	As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $3.3 million for the remaining carrying value of the related trademark.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P146_S2	The Company also determined that the future cash flows associated with the Ojon brand customer list were less than its carrying value.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P146_S3	As the remaining carrying value of the customer list was not recoverable, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $11.7 million.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P146_S4	These impairment charges were reflected in the hair care product category and in the Americas region.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	In an effort to drive down costs and achieve synergies within the organization, in February 2009, the Company announced the implementation of a multi-faceted cost savings program (the Program ) to position the Company to achieve long-term profitable growth.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P148_S1	The Company anticipated the Program would result in total cumulative restructuring charges and other costs to implement those initiatives of between $350 million and $450 million before taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P148_S2	During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company closed the Program.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P148_S3	The Company concluded the approval of all initiatives under the Program and anticipates commencing the execution of those initiatives through fiscal 2014.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P148_S4	As a result of the closure of the Program and the evaluation of the initiatives that have been implemented, as of June 30, 2013, the Company anticipates total cumulative restructuring charges and other costs to implement those initiatives to total between $320 million and $330 million and that such charges have been substantially recorded through fiscal 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P148_S5	The Company will continue to monitor the progress of these initiatives and revise estimates as appropriate.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P149_S0	The following is a reconciliation of cumulative approved charges under the Program as compared with the revised estimated charges related to initiatives under the Program and total cumulative charges incurred through June 30, 2013:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P150_S0	The Program focused on a redesign of the Company s organizational structure in order to integrate it in a more cohesive way and operate more globally across brands and functions.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P150_S1	The principal aspect of the Program was the reduction of the workforce by approximately 2,000 employees.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P150_S2	Specific actions taken since the Program inception included:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P151_S0	Resize and Reorganize the Organization The Company continued the realignment and optimization of its organization to better leverage scale, improve productivity, reduce complexity and achieve cost savings in each region and across various functions.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P151_S1	This included reduction of the workforce which occurred through the consolidation of certain functions, which it achieved through a combination of normal attrition and job eliminations, and the closure and consolidation of certain distribution and office facilities.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P151_S2	As of June 30, 2013, the Company identified approximately $14 million of previously-approved restructuring costs that will not be incurred related to these activities, primarily as a result of certain employees relocating to other available positions within the Company.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P152_S0	Turnaround or Exit Unprofitable Operations To improve the profitability in certain of the Company s brands and regions, the Company has selectively exited certain channels of distribution, categories and markets, and has made changes to turn around others.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P152_S1	This included the exit from the global wholesale distribution of its Prescriptives brand, the reformulation of Ojon brand products and the exit from the global distribution of Sean John products.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P152_S2	In connection with these activities, the Company incurred charges for product returns, inventory write-offs, reduction of workforce and termination of contracts.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P152_S3	As of June 30, 2013, the Company identified approximately $21 million of previously-approved returns and other costs related to these activities that will not be incurred, primarily as a result of better-than-expected sales of products prior to the exit of the operations, as well as lower employee-related and store closure costs than originally estimated.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P153_S0	Outsourcing In order to balance the growing need for information technology support with the Company s efforts to provide the most efficient and cost effective solutions, it continued the outsourcing of certain information technology processes.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P153_S1	The Company incurred costs to transition services to outsource providers and employee-related termination costs.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P153_S2	As of June 30, 2013, the Company identified approximately $26 million of previously-approved outsourcing initiatives for information technology services stemming from the decision not to implement certain aspects of these initiatives, as well as lower costs than originally anticipated to transition services on initiatives that were implemented.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P168_S0	Federal income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $1,980 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P168_S1	The Company intends to reinvest these earnings in its foreign operations indefinitely, except where it is able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P168_S2	As of June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company had not provided federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $1,618 million and $1,208 million, respectively, of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P169_S0	The determination and estimation of the future income tax consequences in all relevant taxing jurisdictions involves the application of highly complex tax laws in the countries involved, particularly in the United States, and is based on the tax profile of the Company in the year of earnings repatriation.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P169_S1	Accordingly, it is not practicable to determine the amount of tax associated with such undistributed earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P170_S0	Significant components of the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P171_S0	As of June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company had current net deferred tax assets of $296.0 million and $247.8 million, respectively, substantially all of which are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P172_S0	As of June 30, 2013 and 2012, certain subsidiaries had net operating loss and other carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately $349 million and $262 million, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P172_S1	With the exception of approximately $340 million of net operating loss and other carryforwards with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 30, 2013, these carryforwards expire at various dates through fiscal 2032.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P172_S2	Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, in the amount of $9.0 million and $3.3 million as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, have been recorded to reflect the tax benefits of the carryforwards not utilized to date.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P173_S0	A full valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P174_S0	Earnings before income taxes include amounts contributed by the Company s foreign operations of approximately $1,220 million, $1,172 million and $1,039 million for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P174_S1	A portion of these earnings are taxed in the United States.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P175_S0	As of June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $64.0 million and $78.5 million, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P175_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $47.2 million.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P177_S0	The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P177_S1	During fiscal 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized gross interest and penalty benefits of $8.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P177_S2	The total gross accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2013 and 2012 were $17.4 million and $28.6 million, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P177_S3	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P178_S0	Earnings from the Company s global operations are subject to tax in various jurisdictions both within and outside the United States.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P179_S0	Compliance Assurance Program ( CAP ).
1001250_13_ITEM15_P179_S1	The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of income tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P180_S0	During the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013, the Company formally concluded the compliance process with respect to fiscal years 2011 and 2012, respectively, under the IRS CAP.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P180_S1	The conclusion of this process did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P180_S2	As of June 30, 2013, the compliance process was ongoing with respect to fiscal 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P181_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company formally concluded the IRS examination of fiscal years 2009 and 2010.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P181_S1	The conclusion of this examination did not materially impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P182_S0	The Company is currently undergoing income tax examinations and controversies in several state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P182_S1	These matters are in various stages of completion and involve complex multi-jurisdictional issues common among multinational enterprises, including transfer pricing, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P183_S0	The Company had been notified of a disallowance of tax deductions claimed by its subsidiary in Spain for fiscal years 1999 through 2002.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P183_S1	An appeal against this reassessment was filed with the Chief Tax Inspector.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P183_S2	On July 18, 2005, the final assessment made by the Chief Tax Inspector was received, confirming the reassessment made by the tax auditors.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P184_S0	During fiscal 2006, an appeal against this final assessment was filed with the Madrid Regional Economic Administrative Tribunal ( TEAR ).
1001250_13_ITEM15_P184_S1	In view of the TEAR s silence, during fiscal 2007 the claim was presumed to be dismissed and an appeal was filed against it with the Central Economic-Administrative Tribunal ( TEAC ).
1001250_13_ITEM15_P184_S2	During the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter, the TEAC dismissed the claim and, on June 10, 2008, the Company filed an appeal for judicial review with the National Appellate Court.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P184_S3	During fiscal 2009, the Company completed the appeal proceedings with the National Appellate Court and, as of June 30, 2011, awaited the court s decision.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P184_S4	During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the National Appellate Court notified the Company that the appeal was denied.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P185_S0	The Company has been assessed corporate income tax and interest of $3.7 million, net of tax, at current exchange rates.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P185_S1	In response, the Company filed an appeal with the Spain Supreme Court.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P185_S2	While no assurance can be given as to the outcome in respect of this assessment and pending appeal in the Spanish courts, based on the decision of the National Appellate Court, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the subsidiary will be successful in its appeal to the Spain Supreme Court.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P185_S3	Accordingly, the Company established a reserve during fiscal 2012 which resulted in an increase to the provision for income taxes equal to the $3.7 million exposure, net of tax.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P185_S4	Separately, during fiscal 2012, the Company s subsidiary in Spain made cash payments totaling $4.0 million, at current exchange rates, to the Spain tax authority as an advance deposit to limit the additional interest that would be due to the Spain tax authority should it receive an unfavorable decision from the Spain Supreme Court.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P186_S0	During fiscal 2013, the Company concluded various state, local and foreign income tax audits and examinations while several other matters, including those noted above, were initiated or remained pending.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P186_S1	On the basis of the information available in this regard as of June 30, 2013, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in a range of $10 million to $15 million within 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of global tax examinations and controversies and a potential lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P208_S1	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P208_S2	The Company may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company s aggregate liability portfolio.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P208_S3	The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P208_S4	The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P208_S5	Costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company s consolidated financial results.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P209_S0	For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P210_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P210_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P210_S2	If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P211_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P212_S0	The fair values of the Company s derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets are presented as follows:

1001250_13_ITEM15_P217_S0	Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P218_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P219_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P219_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P220_S0	The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P220_S1	The Company may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P220_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of March 2015.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P220_S3	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P220_S4	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P221_S0	The ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P221_S1	For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P221_S2	If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in accumulated OCI are reclassified to current-period earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P222_S0	As of June 30, 2013, the Company s foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective in all material respects.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P222_S1	The estimated net gain as of June 30, 2013 that is expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $9.5 million.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P222_S2	The accumulated gain on derivative instruments in accumulated OCI was $16.9 million and $15.3 million as of June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P223_S0	At June 30, 2013, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,579.6 million.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P223_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound ($426.2 million), Euro ($268.8 million), Canadian dollar ($198.6 million), Swiss franc ($111.5 million), Australian dollar ($92.1 million), Thailand baht ($75.5 million) and Hong Kong dollar ($58.1 million).

1001250_13_ITEM15_P225_S0	The Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the identified exposures.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P225_S1	During fiscal 2011, the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreements which had effectively converted the fixed rate interest on its outstanding 2017 Senior Notes to variable interest rates.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P225_S2	Additionally, the instrument, which was classified as an asset, had a fair value of $47.4 million at the date of cash settlement.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P225_S3	This net settlement is classified as a financing activity on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P225_S4	Hedge accounting treatment was discontinued prospectively and the fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt is being amortized against interest expense over the remaining life of the debt.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P226_S0	As a matter of policy, the Company only enters into derivative contracts with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P226_S1	The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P226_S2	Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $21.7 million at June 30, 2013, of which 22% and 21% were attributable to two counterparties.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P226_S3	To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P226_S4	Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P227_S0	Certain of the Company s derivative financial instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P227_S1	At June 30, 2013, the Company was in a net asset position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features with two counterparties.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P227_S2	The fair value of those contracts as of June 30, 2013 was approximately $4.6 million.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P227_S3	As of June 30, 2013, the Company was in compliance with such credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P228_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P229_S0	The Company records its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P229_S1	The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations, goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment, and liabilities associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P230_S0	The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P230_S1	The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P231_S0	Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P232_S0	Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P233_S0	Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P233_S1	The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument s valuation.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P234_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2013:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P235_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2012:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P236_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy and impairment charges for certain of its nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2013:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P237_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P238_S0	To determine the fair value of the Darphin reporting unit at April 1, 2013, the Company used the income approach.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P238_S1	Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of the reporting unit.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P238_S2	For the Darphin reporting unit, negative cash flows in future forecasted periods would not support a value in excess of carrying value and therefore the Company concluded that all remaining goodwill was fully impaired.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P239_S0	To determine fair value of the Darphin trademark at April 1, 2013, the Company assessed the future performance of the related reporting unit and determined that negative cash flows in future forecasted periods would not support a royalty rate for the calculation of fair value of the trademark.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P239_S1	The Company therefore concluded that the carrying value of this asset was not recoverable.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P240_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy and impairment charges for certain of its nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2012:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P241_S0	To determine fair value of the Ojon trademark at December 31, 2011, the Company used the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P241_S1	This method, which is an income approach, assumed that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P241_S2	The calculation of fair value requires significant judgment in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P241_S3	As these inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the fair value calculation, the trademark was classified as Level 3.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P241_S4	In determining its fair value, a terminal growth rate of 3% was applied to future cash flows, and was used in conjunction with a 1.5% royalty rate discounted to present value at a 17% rate.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P242_S0	To determine fair value of the Ojon trademark and customer list at April 1, 2012, the Company assessed the future performance of the related reporting unit and determined that negative cash flows in future forecasted periods would not support a royalty rate for the calculation of fair value of the trademark and negative income associated with existing customers would not support a value for the customer list.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P242_S1	The Company therefore concluded that the carrying value of these assets were not recoverable.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P243_S0	See Note 5 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion of the Company s impairment testing.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P244_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company s other classes of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P245_S0	The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P246_S0	Available-for-sale securities Available-for-sale securities are generally comprised of mutual funds and are valued using quoted market prices on an active exchange.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P246_S1	Available-for-sale securities are included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P247_S0	Note receivable During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company amended the agreement related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields (a brand then owned by the Company) to receive a fixed amount in lieu of future contingent consideration and other rights.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P247_S1	The fair value of the receivable under the amended agreement was determined by discounting the future cash flows using an implied market rate of 6.6%.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P247_S2	This implied market rate reflects the Company s estimate of interest rates prevailing in the market for notes with comparable remaining maturities, the creditworthiness of the counterparty, and an assessment of the ultimate collectability of the instrument.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P247_S3	The implied market rate is deemed to be an unobservable input and as such the Company s note receivable is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P247_S4	An increase or decrease in the risk premium of 100 basis points would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the receivable.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P247_S5	See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on the amended agreement.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P249_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P249_S1	The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P249_S2	To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to 12 months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than 12 months.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P250_S0	Current and long-term debt The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P250_S1	To a lesser extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P250_S2	The Company s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P251_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P252_S0	The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P252_S1	Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P252_S2	In certain instances, the Company adjusts benefits in connection with international employee transfers.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P253_S0	The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P253_S1	The Company s funding policy consists of contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P253_S2	Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ), as amended, and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P254_S0	The Company also has an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P255_S0	The Company maintains international pension plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P255_S1	The Company s funding policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P255_S2	The Company s most significant defined benefit pension obligations are included in the plan summaries below.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P257_S0	The Company maintains a domestic post-retirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P257_S1	Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they retire.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P257_S2	Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P257_S3	Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the retiree.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P257_S4	It is the Company s practice to fund these benefits as incurred and to provide discretionary funding for the future liability up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P258_S0	Certain of the Company s international subsidiaries and affiliates have post-retirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P259_S0	The significant components of the above mentioned plans as of and for the years ended June 30 are summarized as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P260_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P261_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P261_S1	The discount rate for the Company s Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P261_S2	As of June 30, 2013, the Company used an above-mean yield curve, rather than the broad-based yield curve it used before, because it believes it represents a better estimate of an effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of the Company s Domestic Plans.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P262_S0	For the Company s international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P263_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s strategies.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P264_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P265_S0	Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P265_S1	The assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate for the coming year is 6.51% while the weighted-average ultimate trend rate of 4.56% is expected to be reached in approximately 15 years.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P265_S2	A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2013 would have had the following effects:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P266_S0	Amounts recognized in accumulated OCI (before tax) as of June 30, 2013 are as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P267_S0	Amounts in accumulated OCI expected to be amortized as components of net periodic benefit cost during fiscal 2014 are as follows:

1001250_13_ITEM15_P271_S0	The expected cash flows for the Company s pension and post-retirement plans are as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P272_S0	The Company s investment strategy for its pension and post-retirement plan assets is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset classes with the primary goal of meeting long-term cash requirements as they become due.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P272_S1	Assets are primarily invested in diversified funds that hold equity or debt securities to maintain the security of the funds while maximizing the returns within each plan s investment policy.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P272_S2	The investment policy for each plan specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance, as well as investment manager performance.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P273_S0	The Company s target asset allocation at June 30, 2013 is as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P274_S0	The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for plan assets measured at fair value:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P275_S0	The fair value is determined using the Net Asset Value ( NAV ) provided by the administrator of the fund.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P275_S1	The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P275_S2	The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and is primarily classified as Level 2.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P275_S3	When quoted in an active market, these investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P276_S0	Government and agency securities - When quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P276_S1	When quoted market prices are not available in an active market, these investments are classified as Level 2.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P277_S0	The fair values reflect the closing price reported on a major market where the individual securities are traded.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P277_S1	These investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P278_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P279_S0	Debt instruments - The fair values are based on a compilation of primarily observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P279_S1	These investments are primarily classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P280_S0	The fair values are determined using NAV provided by the administrator of the fund.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P280_S1	The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the trust/entity, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P280_S2	When quoted in an active market, these investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P280_S3	When the market is not active, these investments are generally classified within Level 2.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P280_S4	When the market is not active and some inputs are unobservable, these investments are generally classified within Level 3.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P281_S0	Insurance contracts - These instruments are issued by insurance companies.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P281_S1	The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying investment held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P281_S2	The underlying investments are government, asset-backed and fixed income securities.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P282_S0	Insurance contracts are generally classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor other observable inputs for pricing.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P283_S0	Interests in limited partnerships and hedge fund investments - One limited partnership investment and one hedge fund was valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the partnership/fund.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P283_S1	The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the partnership/fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P283_S2	All other limited partnership investments and hedge fund investments are private equity funds and the fair values are determined by the fund managers based on the estimated value of the various holdings of the fund portfolio.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P283_S3	These investments are primarily classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P289_S2	Shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock are not an investment option in the Savings Plan and the Company does not use such shares to match participants contributions.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P290_S0	The Company accrues for deferred compensation and interest thereon, and for the increase in the value of share units pursuant to agreements with certain key executives and outside directors.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P290_S1	The amounts included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $72.1 million and $66.6 million as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P293_S0	(1) Includes long-term and current debt and the related projected interest costs, and to a lesser extent, capital lease commitments.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P293_S1	Interest costs on long-term and current debt are projected to be $61.3 million in each of the years from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2017, $44.6 million in fiscal 2018 and $773.3 million thereafter.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P293_S2	Projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P294_S0	(2) Minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P295_S0	Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, as well as common area maintenance.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P295_S1	These amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P295_S2	Such amounts have not been material to total rent expense.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P295_S3	Total rental expense included in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was $332.4 million, $304.9 million and $290.9 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P295_S5	Future earn-out payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2013, without consideration for potential renewal periods.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P295_S6	(4) Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P295_S7	As of June 30, 2013, the noncurrent portion of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties was $80.5 million.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P295_S8	At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P296_S0	The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its business.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P296_S1	Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P296_S2	However, management s assessment of the Company s current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company, not presently known to the Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P296_S3	Except as disclosed below, reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P297_S0	During the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter, the former owner of the Darphin brand initiated litigation in the Paris Commercial Court against the Company and one of its subsidiaries seeking to recover 60.0 million ($78.3 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2013) that he claims he was owed as additional consideration for the sale of Darphin to the Company in April 2003.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P297_S1	On December 23, 2011, the Paris Commercial Court issued its judgment, awarding the former owner 22.9 million ($29.9 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2013) plus interest from 2007.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P297_S2	The Company has filed its appeal with the Paris Court of Appeal and oral arguments for the appeal are scheduled for December 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P297_S3	In accordance with the judgment, in January 2012, the Company paid 25.3 million ($33.0 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2013) to the former owner and received from him a bank guarantee to assure repayment to the Company of such sum (or any part thereof) in the event that the judgment is reversed by the Paris Court of Appeal.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P297_S4	Based upon its assessment of the case, as well as the advice of external counsel, the Company is maintaining the amount it previously accrued as an amount that it believes will ultimately be paid based on the probable outcome of the appeal.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P297_S5	Such amount is less than the Paris Commercial Court s award.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P308_S4	The Company s equity compensation awards outstanding at June 30, 2013 include stock options, performance share units ( PSU ), restricted stock units ( RSU ), performance share units based on total stockholder return, market share units ( MSU ) and share units.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P309_S0	Total stock-based compensation expense is attributable to the granting of, and the remaining requisite service periods of stock options, PSUs, RSUs, PSUs based on total stockholder return, MSUs and share units.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P309_S1	Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits are as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P310_S0	As of June 30, 2013, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based awards was $104.5 million and the related weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.8 years.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P311_S0	A summary of the Company s stock option programs as of June 30, 2013 and changes during the fiscal year then ended, is presented below:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P312_S0	________________________ (1) The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P313_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P314_S0	The exercise period for all stock options generally may not exceed ten years from the date of grant.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P315_S0	Stock option grants to individuals generally become exercisable in three substantively equal tranches over a service period of up to four years.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P315_S1	The Company attributes the value of option awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P316_S0	The following is a summary of the per-share weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted and total intrinsic value of stock options exercised:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P317_S0	The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P318_S0	The Company uses a weighted-average expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P318_S1	The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P319_S0	For the weighted-average expected option life assumption, the Company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P319_S1	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate for the expected term of the options and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P320_S0	During fiscal 2013, the Company granted approximately 250,900 PSUs, which will be settled in stock subject to the achievement of the Company s net sales, diluted net earnings per common share and return on invested capital goals for the three fiscal years ending June 30, 2015, all subject to the continued employment or retirement of the grantees.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P320_S1	Settlement will be made pursuant to a range of opportunities relative to the net sales, diluted net earnings per common share and return on invested capital targets of the Company and, as such, the compensation cost of the PSU is subject to adjustment based upon the attainability of these target goals.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P320_S2	No settlement will occur for results below the applicable minimum threshold of a target and additional shares shall be issued if performance exceeds the targeted performance goals.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P321_S0	Certain PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the PSU.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P321_S1	Other PSUs granted in fiscal 2013 are not accompanied by dividend equivalent rights and, as such, were valued at the closing market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant less the discounted present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the vesting period.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P321_S2	These awards are subject to the provisions of the agreement under which the PSUs are granted.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P321_S3	The PSUs were valued at the closing market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant and generally vest at the end of the performance period.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P321_S4	Approximately 548,700 shares of Class A Common Stock are anticipated to be issued, relative to the target goals set at the time of issuance, in settlement of the 365,900 PSUs that vested as of June 30, 2013.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P321_S5	In September 2012, approximately 495,900 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock were issued and related accrued dividends were paid, relative to the target goals set at the time of issuance, in settlement of 330,600 PSUs which vested as of June 30, 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P322_S0	The following is a summary of the status of the Company s PSUs as of June 30, 2013 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P323_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P324_S0	The Company granted approximately 1,425,000 RSUs during fiscal 2013 which, at the time of grant, were scheduled to vest as follows: 637,800 on October 31, 2013, 2,900 on January 8, 2014, 336,100 on October 31, 2014, 6,000 on January 8, 2015, 32,600 on June 30, 2015, 4,900 on September 4, 2015, 206,900 on November 2, 2015, 124,300 on November 16, 2015, 8,500 on January 8, 2016, 32,500 on June 30, 2016 and 32,500 on June 30, 2017, all subject to the continued employment or retirement of the grantees.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P324_S1	Certain RSUs granted in fiscal 2013 are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the RSU and, as such, were valued at the closing market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P324_S2	Other RSUs granted in fiscal 2013 are not accompanied by dividend equivalent rights and, as such, were valued at the closing market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant less the discounted present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the vesting period.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P325_S0	The following is a summary of the status of the Company s RSUs as of June 30, 2013 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P326_S0	During fiscal 2013, the Company granted PSUs to an executive of the Company with an aggregate target payout of 162,760 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock, subject to continued employment through the end of the relative performance periods, which end June 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P326_S1	Such PSUs will be settled based upon the Company s relative total stockholder return ( TSR ) over the relevant performance period as compared to companies in the S P 500 on July 1, 2012.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P326_S2	No settlement will occur if the Company s TSR falls below a minimum threshold, and up to an aggregate of 260,416 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock will be issued depending on the extent to which the Company s TSR equals or exceeds the minimum threshold.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P326_S3	The PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the PSUs.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P327_S0	The grant date fair value of the PSUs of $11.0 million was estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions for each performance period, respectively: contractual life of 33, 45 and 57 months, average risk-free interest rate of 0.3%, 0.5% and 0.7% and a dividend yield of 1.0%.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P328_S0	Using the historical stock prices and dividends from public sources, the Company estimated the covariance structure of the returns on S P 500 stocks.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P328_S1	The volatility for the Company s stock produced by this estimation was 32%.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P328_S2	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rates over the contractual term of the grant and the dividend yield is based on historical experience.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P329_S0	As of June 30, 2013, the Company had one outstanding market share unit with a grant date fair value of $10.6 million that was estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions: contractual life of 41 months, a weighted-average expected volatility of 29%, a weighted-average risk-free interest rate of 1.6% and a weighted-average dividend yield of 1.0%.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P330_S0	The Company used an expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities from options on the underlying stock.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P330_S1	The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P330_S2	The expected life is equal to the contractual term of the grant.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P330_S3	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rates over the contractual term of the grant and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P331_S0	The Company grants share units to certain non-employee directors under the Non-Employee Director Share Incentive Plan.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P331_S1	The share units are convertible into shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock as provided for in that plan.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P331_S2	Share units are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that are converted to additional share units when such dividends are declared.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P332_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P333_S0	The following is a summary of the status of the Company s share units as of June 30, 2013 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P334_S0	Certain non-employee directors defer cash compensation in the form of cash payout share units, which are not subject to the Plans.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P334_S1	These share units are classified as liabilities and, as such, their fair value is adjusted to reflect the current market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P334_S2	The Company recorded $3.0 million, $0.8 million and $4.9 million as compensation expense to reflect additional deferrals and the change in the market value for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P335_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share ( basic EPS ) is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain conditions).
1001250_13_ITEM15_P335_S1	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share assuming dilution ( diluted EPS ) is computed by reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P336_S0	A reconciliation between the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P337_S0	As of June 30, 2013, 0.1 million outstanding stock options were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P337_S1	As of June 30, 2012 and 2011, outstanding stock options that were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive were de minimis.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P337_S2	As of June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, 0.5 million, 0.6 million and 0.7 million, respectively, of PSUs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement of certain performance targets of the Company, as discussed in Note 15 Stock Programs.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P338_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P339_S0	The components of Accumulated OCI ( AOCI ) included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consist of the following:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P340_S0	Of the $18.3 million, net of tax, derivative instrument gain recorded in AOCI at June 30, 2013, $10.9 million in gains, net of tax, related to foreign currency forward contracts, which the Company will reclassify to earnings through March 2015.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P340_S1	Also included in the net derivative instrument gain recorded in AOCI was $7.9 million, net of tax, related to the October 2003 gain from the settlement of the treasury lock agreements upon the issuance of the Company s 2033 Senior Notes, which is being reclassified to earnings as an offset to interest expense over the life of the debt.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P340_S2	These gains were partially offset by $0.5 million, net of tax, related to a loss from the settlement of a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements upon the issuance of the Company s 2037 Senior Notes, which is being reclassified to earnings as an addition to interest expense over the life of the debt.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P341_S0	Refer to Note 12 Pension, Deferred Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Plans for the discussion regarding the net pension and post-retirement adjustments.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P343_S0	Supplemental cash flow information is as follows:
1001250_13_ITEM15_P344_S0	Reportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Chief Executive ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P344_S1	As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P345_S0	Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P346_S0	While the Company s results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P346_S1	Accordingly, net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P346_S2	These product categories meet the definition of operating segments and, accordingly, additional financial data are provided below.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P347_S0	The other segment includes the sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P348_S0	Product category performance is measured based upon net sales before returns associated with restructuring activities, and earnings before income taxes, other income, net interest expense, interest expense on debt extinguishment and total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P348_S1	Returns and charges associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to the product categories because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide program to redesign the Company s organizational structure.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P348_S2	The accounting policies for the Company s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P348_S3	The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P351_S1	The net sales from the Company s travel retail business are included in the Europe, the Middle East Africa region.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P351_S2	The Company is domiciled in the United States.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P351_S3	Net sales in the United States in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $3,756.1 million, $3,582.1 million and $3,309.1 million, respectively.

1001250_13_ITEM15_P358_S0	(5) As a result of the Company s SAP rollout, approximately $94 million and $30 million of accelerated orders were recorded as net sales (approximately $78 million and $23 million of operating income) in the fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 second quarters, respectively, that likely would have occurred in the fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 third quarters, respectively.
1001250_13_ITEM15_P359_S0	(6) The Company established a provision in the fiscal 2012 third quarter for then-anticipated returns of approximately $16 million as a result of repositioning certain products due to changes in regulations related to sunscreen products in the United States.

1001250_14_ITEM6_P4_S1	We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million ($12.2 million after tax, or $.03 per diluted share) representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.
1001250_14_ITEM6_P5_S0	In May 2010, we completed a cash tender offer for $130.0 million principal amount of our 6.00% Senior Notes due January 15, 2012 at a price of 108.500% of the principal amount and for $69.9 million principal amount of our 2013 Senior Notes at a tender price of 118.813% of the principal amount.

1001250_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2014 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1001250_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company s financial condition.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at our retail stores.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	In accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.4% in fiscal 2014, 3.3% in fiscal 2013 and 3.5% in fiscal 2012.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	This accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	Consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	Experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $23.9 million and $22.7 million as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by $8.3 million, $23.0 million and $13.8 million for customer deductions and write-offs in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and increased by $9.5 million, $14.6 million and $11.0 million for additional provisions in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Inventory We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	We believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead, as well as inbound freight.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P8_S4	Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P8_S5	Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Costs We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan ( U.S. Qualified Plan ) and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the Domestic Plans a domestic contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	The amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	While we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	For fiscal 2014, we used discount rates for our Domestic Plans of between 4.30% and 4.90% and varying rates on our international plans of between 1.00% and 7.25%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The discount rate for our Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	We used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	For our international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	For fiscal 2014, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.50% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of between 2.25% and 7.25% for our international plans.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 Pension, Deferred Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Plans for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	Those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	For fiscal 2014, our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $129 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $68 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The resulting net deferred gain of approximately $61 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 23 years.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans exceeded expectations, primarily reflecting strong performance from global equity and U.S. fixed income investments.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	A 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2014 pension expense:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2014 would have had the following effects:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	To determine the fiscal 2015 net periodic benefit cost, we are using discount rates of 4.30% and 3.60% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and the non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan, respectively, and varying rates for our international plans of between .50% and 6.75%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	We are using an expected return on plan assets of 7.50% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 2.00% and 6.75%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	The net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal 2014 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $3 million in fiscal 2015.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	We make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	Impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge is recorded.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	We use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and, in certain instances, we engage third-party valuation specialists for advice.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	To determine fair value of the reporting units, we generally use an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	In certain circumstances, equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable (e.g., only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins).
1001250_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	We believe both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Under the income approach, we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	Under the market approach, we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, to value the reporting unit.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	The fiscal 2014 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first eight years of our projections, as considered appropriate for the individual reporting units, ranged between 3% and 17% with the higher growth rates in certain of the Company s smaller reporting units that are expected to continue the growth that they have exhibited over the past several years.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	The following fiscal 2013 estimates and factors exclude those related to our Darphin reporting unit, for which we recorded an impairment charge of the remainder of its goodwill.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	The fiscal 2013 compound annual growth rate of sales for the first five to eight years of our projections ranged between 5% and 22% with the higher growth rates in certain of the Company s smaller reporting units that are expected to continue the growth that they have exhibited over the past several years.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P29_S4	For reporting units with positive earnings, growth in the corresponding earnings before interest and taxes ranged from 3% to 38% in fiscal 2014 as compared with 7% to 49% in fiscal 2013.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P29_S5	The terminal growth rates were projected at 3% after eight years in fiscal 2014 and five to eight years in fiscal 2013, which reflects our estimate of long-term market and gross domestic product growth.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P29_S6	The weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from 9% to 17% in fiscal 2014 as compared with 8% to 15% in fiscal 2013.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P29_S7	The range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2014 impairment testing was from 1.2 to 3.5 times trailing-twelve-month sales and 9.0 to 12.0 times trailing-twelve-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P29_S8	The range of market multiples used in our fiscal 2013 impairment testing was from 1.5 to 3.5 times trailing-twelve-month sales and between 8.5 to 13.0 times trailing-twelve-month earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P29_S9	Future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P29_S10	However, a decrease of 100 basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of 100 basis points in our weighted-average cost of capital would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	To determine fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we use an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	The fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 terminal growth rate applied to future cash flows was 3% and the fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 discount rates ranged from 9% to 17% in fiscal 2014 and 10% to 18% in fiscal 2013.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 royalty rates ranged from 0.5% to 12%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	These rates exclude those related to the Darphin trademark, for which we recorded an impairment charge for its remaining carrying value in fiscal 2013.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	As of our annual step-one goodwill and indefinite-lived asset impairment test on April 1, 2014, the fair values of our reporting units and the fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets substantially exceeded their respective carrying values.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	As of June 30, 2014, we have current net deferred tax assets of $295.1 million and non-current net deferred tax assets of $85.5 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of $115.2 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P35_S4	Based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P35_S5	If we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P36_S4	For those tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	We classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Quantitative Analysis During the three-year period ended June 30, 2014, there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	The results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	For fiscal 2014, had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately $5.8 million, operating expenses would have changed by approximately $0.6 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.7 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	The collective impact of these changes on operating income, net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc., and net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately $6.4 million, $5.7 million and $.01, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Item 8.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 19 Segment Data and Related Information for all periods presented.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	Therefore, we present certain net sales information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	We calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Overview We believe that the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with the products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers changing shopping habits.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	To be the global leader in prestige beauty, we continued to implement a long-term strategy that is guiding us through fiscal 2017.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	The strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, channels of distribution, product categories, brands and functions that are designed to leverage our strengths, make us more productive and grow our sales.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	We have a strong, diverse and highly valuable brand portfolio with global reach and potential, and we plan to continue building upon and leveraging our history of outstanding creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	We have succeeded in expanding our distinctive High-Touch service model and will continue to look for ways to further evolve it within our channels of distribution and geographic regions.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	As an example, we continue to enhance our capabilities to deliver superior retailing experiences across our brands, particularly in freestanding retail stores.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	We also continue to increase brand awareness and sales by expanding our multi-pronged digital presence encompassing e-commerce and m-commerce, as well as digital and social media.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	We are leveraging our regional organization in an effort to assure that we are locally relevant with our products, services, channels, marketing and visual merchandising.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	As part of our strategy, we are continuing to position ourselves to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest-growing areas in prestige beauty.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	Skin care, our most profitable product category, continues to be a strategic priority for our innovation and investment spending, particularly in the Asia/Pacific region and with product launches such as Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II from Est e Lauder and Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion + from Clinique.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	We are also focusing our attention on luxury consumers across all product categories and have seen continued strength in the net sales of many of our higher-end prestige products.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	We also continue to build our makeup product category through the introduction of new product offerings, including new collections from our makeup artist brands and Pure Color Sculpting lipstick from Est e Lauder and our fragrance category through new launches and innovation, such as Est e Lauder Modern Muse and new fragrances from Michael Kors and Tory Burch.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	In addition, we are continuing to expand our hair care brands both in salons and in other retail channels.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	We are strengthening our geographic presence by seeking share growth in large, image-building cities within core markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Japan.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	In addition, we continue to prioritize efforts to expand our presence and accelerate share growth in emerging markets such as China, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Brazil and South Africa and focus on consumers who purchase in the travel retail channel, in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	We also continue to expand our digital presence in international markets, which has resulted in growth in the net sales of our products sold online.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	In North America, despite solid retail sales growth during the holiday season, we saw a softening in the retail environment during the second half of fiscal 2014 in our traditional department store channel, due in part to adverse winter weather conditions.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	At the same time, we continued to expand our presence in other channels, such as specialty multi-brand retailers, freestanding retail stores and online.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	Internationally, we continue to take actions to grow in European perfumeries and pharmacies and in department stores, particularly in Asia and the United Kingdom.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	In addition, we are emphasizing our skin care and makeup initiatives to boost our travel retail sales and continuing efforts to grow our business in the freestanding retail store, online, specialty multi-brand retailer and prestige salon channels.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P51_S4	The travel retail channel continues to be an important source of sales growth and profitability.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P51_S5	Our business in this channel has benefited from the implementation of programs we designed to target consumers in distinct travel corridors, enhance consumers High-Touch experiences and convert travelers into purchasers.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	While our overall business is performing well, we are seeing continued softness in certain Southern European countries and Korea due to challenging economic environments, as well as intensifying competitive pressures globally.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Elsewhere, we are cautious of an uncertain retail environment in the United States in the short term, unfavorable foreign exchange rates in certain emerging countries, and the lower growth rates we have been experiencing in China.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	We also continue to see an adverse impact of Chinese government actions on the travel and spending of Chinese consumers, which are affecting sales in the travel retail channel, at their travel destinations and within their home market.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	We believe we have and will continue to offset to some extent the impact of these challenges as a result of our strategy to mitigate weaknesses we find in certain areas by utilizing the strengths of our diverse brand portfolio and geographic presence in other areas.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	However, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged, then we expect there to be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence, demand and spending and, as a result, our business.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	We will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, we plan to continue building on our strengths and our heritage of innovation to bring unique and high-performance products with long-term appeal and enduring quality to our consumers.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	We expect our strategy will enable us to continue to succeed in high growth channels, benefit from regional opportunities, focus on emerging market consumers and enhance our local relevance.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	We plan on continuing to incorporate our personalized High-Touch philosophy through customization with key retailers, expansion in freestanding retail stores and extending it to fast-growing digital platforms.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	We remain dedicated to investing in select areas to improve our capabilities or develop new ones.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P54_S4	Our main focuses are digital capabilities, research and development, product innovation, consumer insight, information technology improvements and operational excellence.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	We rolled out the last major wave of SMI in July 2014 in certain of our remaining locations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	As a result, some retailers accelerated their sales orders that we believe would normally occur in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the SMI rollout.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The impact on net sales and operating results by product category and geographic region is as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	These actions created a favorable comparison between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 of approximately $178 million in net sales and approximately $127 million in operating results and impacted our operating margin comparisons.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	While these additional orders benefited our fiscal 2014 net sales and operating results comparisons, we expect there to be a corresponding adverse effect on our first quarter and full year fiscal 2015 net sales and operating results.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	We believe the presentation of certain year-to-date comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our Venezuelan subsidiary has been operating in a highly inflationary economy since January 2010.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties in Venezuela have resulted in stringent controls on foreign currency exchange.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	In February 2013, there was a devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar fuerte ( VEF ), from an official rate of 4.3 to 6.3.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	We recorded a devaluation charge in our fiscal 2013 third quarter, which did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net sales or operating income.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	In October 2013, the Venezuelan government introduced an auction-based foreign currency exchange mechanism ( SICAD I ).
1001250_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	Participation in the weekly auctions is limited to certain industries determined by the Venezuelan government.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	Since we were unable to transact in the only SICAD I auction we were authorized to participate, we continued to use the official published rate of 6.3 to remeasure our VEF-denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted additional changes to the country s foreign exchange controls that expanded the use of SICAD I and created a third exchange control mechanism ( SICAD II ), which allows all companies in all sectors to apply for the purchase of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated securities for any legal use or purpose.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	As a result, we considered our company-specific facts and circumstances in determining the appropriate remeasurement rate, principally assessing our legal eligibility to access the available foreign exchange mechanisms, the transactions that would be eligible, our past and expected future ability to transact through those mechanisms, and our intent to utilize a particular mechanism for particular purposes.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	Although the SICAD II mechanism and its level and frequency of exchange continue to be regulated by the Venezuelan government, it offers the possibility of foreign exchange in a theoretically open market without restricted uses and in our opinion is the only mechanism legally available at this time for our highest priority transactions, which are the import of goods.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P61_S3	We have submitted applications to access U.S. dollars through the SICAD II mechanism and certain applications have been approved and we have received funds through June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P61_S4	While there is no guarantee our future applications will be accepted, based on the enacted changes and related considerations of how our business is eligible under the requirements established by the Venezuelan authorities, we believe the SICAD II rate was, and continues to be, the most appropriate rate that reflects the economics of our Venezuelan subsidiary s business since March 24, 2014, when the SICAD II mechanism became operational.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P61_S5	As a result, we changed the exchange rate used to remeasure our VEF-denominated monetary assets and liabilities from 6.3 to the SICAD II rate, which was 49.98 as of June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P61_S6	Accordingly, a remeasurement charge of $38.3 million, on a before and after tax basis, was reflected in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Furthermore, in January 2014, in an effort to control inflation, pricing and product shortages, the Venezuelan government enacted a law which imposed a cap on profit margins.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	We have evaluated the impact of this law and while it has challenged our local business, it did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Further controls on foreign currency exchange or other actions by the Venezuelan government could have an impact on our local business, however, we do not consider our Venezuelan operations significant to our overall business.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	On a consolidated basis, we derived less than 1% of our net sales and approximately 1% of our operating income (before the remeasurement charge) from our business in Venezuela for the year ended June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Returns and Charges Associated with Restructuring Activities During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we closed our multi-faceted cost savings program implemented in February 2009 (the Program ) and have executed substantially all remaining initiatives as of June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	Total cumulative restructuring charges and other costs to implement those initiatives from inception of the Program to date are $317.5 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	The following table presents aggregate restructuring charges (adjustments) related to the Program to date:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	The following table presents accrued restructuring charges (adjustments) and the related activities under the Program to date:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Accrued restructuring charges at June 30, 2014 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately $7 million and $1 million in fiscal 2015 and 2016, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	The following table presents total returns and charges (adjustments) associated with restructuring and other activities related to the Program:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Other charges in connection with the implementation of the Program were primarily related to consulting and other professional services.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	Net sales increased 8%, or $787.1 million, to $10,968.8 million, primarily reflecting growth in all of our product categories and geographic regions.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	The impact of foreign currency translation on the change in net sales was de minimis.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	In advance of our July 2014 implementation of SMI at certain of our locations and to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the rollout, certain of our retailers accelerated their orders during the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	We believe those additional orders, which totaled approximately $178 million, would normally occur in our fiscal 2015 first quarter and created a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	While these additional orders benefited our fiscal 2014 net sales comparison, we expect there to be a corresponding adverse effect on our first quarter and full year fiscal 2015 net sales.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P71_S3	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales would have increased 6%, with growth in all of our product categories and geographic regions.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The change in net sales in each product category benefited from the accelerated orders during the current year, as discussed above, as follows: skin care, approximately $91 million; makeup, approximately $65 million; fragrance, approximately $21 million; and hair care, approximately $1 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 7%, or $304.5 million, to $4,769.8 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	The recent launches of Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II and Micro Essence Skin Activating Treatment Lotion from Est e Lauder, and Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion + and reformulated Repairwear Laser Focus from Clinique contributed approximately $615 million of incremental sales, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	Also contributing to the increase were higher sales of La Mer products and the Nutritious line of products from Est e Lauder of approximately $144 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of certain existing Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery products from Est e Lauder and Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion and Repairwear Laser Focus from Clinique of approximately $493 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P73_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 8%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P73_S5	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in skin care would have increased 5%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Makeup Makeup net sales increased 9%, or $333.3 million, to $4,210.2 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales from our makeup artist brands, the recent launch of All About Shadow from Clinique and higher sales of Smashbox products of approximately $339 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	Sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings, as well as expanded distribution in line with our retail store strategy.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of Chubby Stick Moisturizing Lip Colour Balm and High Impact Lip Color from Clinique, as well as the prior-year launches of Pore Refining Solutions Makeup from Clinique and Pure Color Vivid Shine Lipstick from Est e Lauder of approximately $34 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P74_S3	The impact of foreign currency translation on makeup net sales was de minimis.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P74_S4	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in makeup would have increased 7%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products increased 9%, or $114.2 million, to $1,425.0 million, primarily reflecting the recent launches of Est e Lauder Modern Muse, the Michael Kors Collection, Jo Malone Peony Blush Suede and Tory Burch, as well as higher sales of Tom Ford Black Orchid of approximately $149 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Est e Lauder pleasures , Donna Karan Cashmere Mist, DKNY Be Delicious So Intense and Coach Poppy of approximately $31 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	The impact of foreign currency translation on fragrance net sales was de minimis.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in fragrance would have increased 7%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 5%, or $26.7 million, to $515.6 million, reflecting the continued success and growth of the Invati line of products and the new and reformulated Dry Remedy line of products from Aveda, which contributed approximately $25 million, combined to the increase.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	The category benefited from sales generated from expanded global distribution of Aveda products to salons and in the travel retail channel and Bumble and bumble products to specialty multi-brand retailers.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of Ojon products.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P77_S3	The decrease in Ojon net sales was primarily due to the exit of that business from the direct response television channel in our fiscal 2014 second quarter.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P77_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 6%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P77_S5	The impact of the accelerated orders on the change in reported net sales in hair care was de minimis.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	The overall change in net sales in each geographic region benefited from the accelerated orders during the current year, as discussed above, as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	Americas, approximately $84 million; Europe, the Middle East Africa, approximately $68 million; and Asia/Pacific, approximately $26 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Net sales in the Americas increased 6%, or $269.4 million, to $4,572.3 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales in the United States of approximately $231 million, including the $84 million in accelerated orders.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	This growth primarily reflected new collections from our makeup artist brands, higher sales of prestige products from our luxury brands, the continued expansion of Smashbox at specialty multi-brand retailers and department stores, contributions from new product innovations from certain of our heritage brands, new launches from certain of our designer fragrances and expansion into new retail channels by certain of our hair care brands.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	We are cautious of an uncertain retail environment in the United States in the short term.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Net sales in Latin America increased approximately $24 million, led by Venezuela and Brazil.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	The net sales increase in Venezuela was primarily due to price increases as a result of rising inflation.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	Net sales in Canada increased approximately $15 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P81_S3	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, the Americas net sales increased 7%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P81_S4	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in the Americas would have increased 4%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, net sales increased 11%, or $405.0 million, to $4,163.7 million, primarily reflecting higher sales from our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, Germany and France of approximately $335 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	The net sales increase in our travel retail business primarily reflected the success of new launch initiatives, an increase in global airline passenger traffic and expanded distribution, as well as the impact of the accelerated orders.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	This was despite a slowdown at retail, in part, due to an adverse impact of Chinese government actions on the travel and spending of Chinese consumers.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	Higher sales in the United Kingdom and France were primarily driven by certain of our makeup artist and luxury brands.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P82_S4	The net sales increase in Germany was primarily driven by our makeup artist and certain of our heritage brands.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P82_S5	These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in South Africa and India of approximately $7 million, combined, driven by the weakening of their respective currencies.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P82_S6	We are seeing continued softness in certain Southern European countries due to challenging economic environments.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P82_S7	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Europe, the Middle East Africa net sales increased 9%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P82_S8	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in Europe, the Middle East Africa would have increased 9%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 5%, or $111.1 million, to $2,232.7 million, primarily reflecting higher sales in China and Hong Kong of approximately $119 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	Higher sales in China were primarily driven by expanded distribution.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	Despite the higher sales in China, we are cautious of the lower growth rates we have been experiencing during the current year.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	The net sales increase in Hong Kong was primarily due to higher net sales from certain of our heritage and luxury brands.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in Japan and Australia of approximately $17 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	The declines in Japan and Australia were driven by the weakening of their respective currencies, which more than offset an improvement in their local retail environments and the impact of the accelerated orders in Japan.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P84_S3	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 9%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P84_S4	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in Asia/Pacific would have increased 4%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 19.7% as compared with 19.9% in the prior year.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales reflected strategic changes in pricing and the mix of our business of approximately 30 basis points and favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	Partially offsetting these changes were an increase in obsolescence charges and the unfavorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points, each.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	In addition, future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of potential new brands or channels of distribution which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 63.6% as compared with 65.1% in the prior year.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	As a percentage of net sales, this decrease primarily reflected lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling of approximately 110 basis points, lower selling costs of approximately 50 basis points and a favorable comparison to the prior year, which reflected restructuring, goodwill and other impairment charges of approximately 40 basis points, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P88_S2	These improvements were partially offset by a charge in the current year to remeasure net monetary assets in Venezuela of approximately 30 basis points and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P88_S3	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders in the current year, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales would have decreased 50 basis points, primarily reflecting lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling, and lower selling costs.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets and brands being emphasized.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	Operating income increased 20%, or $301.6 million, to $1,827.6 million and operating margin increased to 16.7% of net sales as compared with 15.0% in the prior year, which primarily reflected our lower operating expense margin and, to a lesser extent, our higher gross margin.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	The overall operating results were also impacted by approximately $127 million related to the accelerated orders in the current year, as discussed above, which created a favorable comparison to the prior year, partially offset by the current year remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela of $38.3 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	While these additional orders benefited our fiscal 2014 operating results comparison, we expect there to be a corresponding adverse effect on our first quarter and full year fiscal 2015 operating results.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of total charges (adjustments) associated with restructuring activities of $(2.9) million, or less than 1% of net sales, for fiscal 2014 and $17.8 million, or less than 1% of net sales, for fiscal 2013.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	We believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders in the current year and charges (adjustments) associated with restructuring activities, operating income would have increased 10% and operating margin would have increased 50 basis points.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	The overall change in operating results in each product category benefited from the accelerated orders during the current year, as discussed above, as follows: skin care, approximately $72 million; makeup, approximately $41 million; fragrance, approximately $14 million; and the impact on hair care was de minimis.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	Skin care operating income increased 18%, or $145.7 million, to $975.8 million, primarily reflecting higher results driven by recent product launches from Est e Lauder and Clinique and higher sales of luxury skin care products.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	Makeup operating income increased 23%, or $135.5 million, to $715.9 million, primarily reflecting improved results from our makeup artist brands and certain of our heritage brands, attributable to growth in net sales.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	We reallocated our investment spending among brands and media formats which positively impacted operating income in the skin care and makeup product categories.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P94_S3	Fragrance operating income decreased 13%, or $16.2 million, to $104.1 million, primarily reflecting higher investment spending behind recent major launches, partially offset by higher results from our luxury brands.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P94_S4	The current year remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela impacted the skin care, makeup and fragrance product categories by $12 million, $16 million and $10 million, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P94_S5	Hair care operating results increased 26%, or $7.0 million, to $33.7 million, primarily reflecting higher results from Aveda and strategic reductions in spending behind Ojon products.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P94_S6	Adjusting for the accelerated orders, operating income in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care product categories would have increased (decreased) 9%, 16%, (25%) and 26%, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	The overall change in operating results in each geographic region benefited as a result of the accelerated orders during the current year, as discussed above, as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	Americas, approximately $53 million; Europe, the Middle East Africa, approximately $53 million; and Asia/Pacific, approximately $21 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Operating income in the Americas increased 27%, or $114.1 million, to $537.3 million, primarily reflecting the increase in net sales, as previously discussed, as well as a more measured approach to spending.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	These improvements were partially offset by the current year remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in the Americas would have increased 14%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, operating income increased 15%, or $124.9 million, to $938.3 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	Higher results from our travel retail business and in the United Kingdom totaled approximately $126 million, combined, primarily reflecting higher sales.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	The higher results in our travel retail business also reflected the impact of the accelerated orders.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P97_S3	These improvements were partially offset by lower operating results in France and the Middle East of approximately $10 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P97_S4	The lower results in France were due to higher spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P97_S5	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in Europe, the Middle East Africa would have increased 9%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 14%, or $41.9 million, to $349.1 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	Higher results in Korea, Japan and Hong Kong totaled approximately $45 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P98_S2	The higher results in Korea were due to lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling and the higher results in Japan primarily reflected the impact of the accelerated orders.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P98_S3	The higher results in the region were partially offset by lower operating results of approximately $11 million in China and Thailand, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P98_S4	The lower results from China were primarily driven by an increase in investment spending as a result of new product introductions and increased distribution.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P98_S5	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in Asia/Pacific would have increased 7%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	Net interest expense decreased to $50.8 million as compared with $54.8 million in the prior year, primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower rates in fiscal 2013 and higher interest income.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we redeemed the $230.1 million principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2013 at a price of 108% of the principal amount.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	We recognized $23.1 million as other income during fiscal 2013, primarily reflecting the amended agreement related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields (a brand then owned by us).
1001250_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P102_S2	Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P102_S3	In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the period of change.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	The effective rate for income taxes was 32.0% and 30.6% for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	The increase in the rate of 140 basis points was principally attributable to a higher effective tax rate related to the Company s foreign operations, which included the impact of the Venezuela remeasurement charge for which no tax benefit has been provided, as well as slightly higher favorable income tax reserve adjustments recorded in the prior year.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. as compared with the prior year increased 18%, or $184.3 million, to $1,204.1 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased 19% from $2.58 to $3.06.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	Management believes that excluding these items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	The following tables present Net Sales, Operating Income and Diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of accelerated orders associated with the July 2014 SMI rollout, the Venezuela fiscal 2014 remeasurement charge, returns and charges (adjustments) associated with restructuring activities and the fiscal 2013 interest expense on debt extinguishment.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	The tables provide reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	Net sales increased 5%, or $468.1 million, to $10,181.7 million, reflecting growth in all of our major product categories within each geographic region.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 6%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	The following discussions of Net Sales by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of $1.5 million and $2.1 million recorded during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	We believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 6%, or $240.1 million, to $4,465.3 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	The fiscal 2013 launches of Perfectionist CP+R, Advanced Time Zone, Advanced Night Repair Eye Serum Infusion and the Optimizer line of products from Est e Lauder contributed approximately $273 million, combined, to the increase.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P111_S2	Also contributing approximately $99 million, combined, to the increase were the fiscal 2013 launches of The Moisturizing Soft Cream from La Mer and Even Better Eyes Dark Circle Corrector from Clinique.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P111_S3	Serum and Time Zone, as well as Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator, which was a new launch in fiscal 2012, from Est e Lauder of approximately $162 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P111_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 7%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	Makeup Makeup net sales increased 5%, or $180.1 million, to $3,876.9 million, primarily reflecting an increase in net sales from our makeup artist brands of approximately $156 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P112_S1	The fiscal 2013 launches of High Impact Extreme Volume Mascara and Chubby Stick Intense from Clinique and Pure Color Vivid Shine Lipstick from Est e Lauder contributed approximately $47 million of incremental sales, combined to the increase.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P112_S2	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of Repairwear Laser Focus Makeup from Clinique and Pure Color Eyeshadow and Doublewear Stay-In-Place Makeup from Est e Lauder, all of which were new launches in fiscal 2012, of approximately $45 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P112_S3	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 6%.

1001250_14_ITEM7_P113_S3	These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Est e Lauder Sensuous Nude and DKNY Golden Delicious, both of which were new launches in fiscal 2012, as well as pureDKNY, of approximately $52 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P113_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased 4%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 6%, or $26.5 million, to $488.9 million, primarily reflecting the continued success of the Invati line of products and the fiscal 2013 launches of Pure Abundance Style Prep and Be Curly Curl Controller from Aveda.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	The category also benefited from sales generated from expanded global distribution, in particular, to salons for Aveda and multi-brand specialty retailers for Bumble and bumble.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P114_S2	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of Bumble and bumble brand products to salons and lower net sales of Ojon brand products due, in part, to a reduction in our business in the DRTV channel.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P114_S3	The impact of foreign currency translation on hair care net sales was de minimis.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Net sales in the Americas increased 5%, or $201.8 million, to $4,302.9 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	The increase during fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to growth in the United States of approximately $172 million, due in large part to product offerings from our heritage and makeup artist brands.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P115_S2	Net sales in Canada increased approximately $13 million, primarily reflecting increased sales from certain of our heritage brands as a result of expanded distribution.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P115_S3	These increases also reflected the efforts of our expanded pull/push activities, which included innovative advertising that continued to draw new consumers to our brands and our ongoing efforts to work with retailers in the United States and Canada on strengthening the High-Touch concepts used to help market our products.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P115_S4	Net sales in Latin America increased approximately $19 million, led by Venezuela and Mexico.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P115_S5	The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in the Americas was de minimis.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, net sales increased 4%, or $155.5 million, to $3,758.7 million, primarily reflecting higher sales from our travel retail business and in the United Kingdom and the Middle East of approximately $185 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	The net sales increase in our travel retail business primarily reflected a strong retail environment for our products, new product launches and, to a lesser extent, an increase in global airline passenger traffic.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P116_S2	Higher sales in the United Kingdom were primarily driven by our makeup artist brands and new product launches from certain of our heritage brands.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P116_S3	In addition, the United Kingdom benefited from increased sales of certain of our luxury fragrance and skin care products.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P116_S4	Higher sales in the Middle East were primarily driven by our makeup artist brands and sales of luxury fragrances.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P116_S5	These increases in the region were partially offset by lower net sales in Spain, Russia, Switzerland and the Balkans of approximately $45 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P116_S6	With the exception of Russia, these lower net sales reflected the challenging economic environments in certain countries in Europe.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P116_S7	The lower net sales in Russia primarily reflected destocking associated with challenges with a certain customer.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P116_S8	The overall change in Europe, the Middle East Africa net sales was inclusive of unfavorable exchange rates due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies in this region of approximately $75 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P116_S9	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Europe, the Middle East Africa increased 6%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 5%, or $110.2 million, to $2,121.6 million, primarily reflecting growth in our sales of skin care products, in line with our strategy.

1001250_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	Net sales in China benefited from expanded distribution.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P117_S3	Higher sales in Hong Kong were primarily driven by launches from our heritage brands and higher-end prestige skin care products.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P117_S4	These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in Korea and Japan of approximately $66 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P117_S5	The lower net sales in Korea primarily reflected a challenging economic environment and continued competitive pressures facing prestige beauty in Korea.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	The decline in Japan was driven by the weakening of the Japanese yen.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 6%.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 19.9% as compared with 20.5% in fiscal 2012.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	This improvement reflected changes in the mix of our business and pricing of approximately 40 basis points, favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 20 basis points and the favorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P120_S2	These improvements were partially offset by a provision for foreign transactional taxes of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 65.1% as compared with 66.0% in fiscal 2012.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P121_S1	This improvement reflected a decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales of approximately 50 basis points, a decrease in charges associated with restructuring activities of approximately 40 basis points and lower selling and shipping costs as a percentage of net sales of 10 basis points.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P121_S2	Also included in this improvement was a favorable change in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points and lower charges associated with other intangible asset impairments of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P121_S3	Partially offsetting these improvements were higher costs related to stock-based compensation of approximately 20 basis points and increased spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling in line with our strategy of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	Changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets being emphasized.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	Operating income increased 16%, or $214.3 million, to $1,526.0 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P123_S1	Operating margin increased to 15.0% of net sales as compared with 13.5% in fiscal 2012, reflecting our higher gross margin and the decrease in our operating expense margin, as previously discussed.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of $17.8 million, or 0.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2013 and $63.2 million, or 0.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2012.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P124_S1	We believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	Skin care operating income increased 11%, or $83.4 million, to $830.1 million, primarily reflecting improved results from higher-margin product launches from Est e Lauder and La Mer, partially offset by goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $17.7 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P125_S1	Makeup operating income increased 8%, or $42.4 million, to $580.4 million, primarily reflecting improved results from our M A C brand, partially offset by certain of our heritage brands and an increase in investment spending in line with our strategy.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P125_S2	Fragrance operating income increased 20%, or $20.2 million, to $120.3 million, primarily reflecting increased profitability from certain Jo Malone, Est e Lauder and Clinique products, partially offset by lower results from certain of our designer fragrances.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P125_S3	Hair care operating results increased over 100%, or $14.5 million, to $26.7 million, due to a favorable comparison to fiscal 2012 which was impacted by other intangible asset impairment charges of $21.7 million, partially offset by lower sales of Bumble and bumble brand products and higher investment spending by Aveda to support the Invati line of products.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	Operating income in the Americas increased 47%, or $134.8 million, to $423.2 million, primarily reflecting improved results from our makeup artist and luxury brands and certain of our hair care and heritage brands, driven by improved category mix, partially offset by the timing and level of strategic investment spending in fiscal 2013.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P127_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, operating income increased 9%, or $67.1 million, to $813.4 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P127_S1	Higher results from our travel retail business, the Middle East and the United Kingdom totaled approximately $77 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P127_S2	Partially offsetting these improvements were lower results in Germany and Spain of approximately $5 million, combined, as well as goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $17.7 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P128_S0	In Asia/Pacific, operating income decreased 10%, or $33.0 million, to $307.2 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P128_S1	Higher results from China and Thailand totaled approximately $22 million, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P128_S2	These higher results were more than offset by lower operating results of approximately $51 million in Korea, Hong Kong and Japan, combined.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P128_S3	The lower results in Hong Kong were due in part to investment spending to support new product launches.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P129_S0	Net interest expense was $54.8 million as compared with $61.1 million in fiscal 2012.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P129_S1	Interest expense decreased primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower rates.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P130_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we redeemed the $230.1 million principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2013 at a price of 108% of the principal amount.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P130_S1	We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P131_S0	In December 2012, we amended the agreement related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields (a brand then owned by us) to receive a fixed amount in lieu of future contingent consideration and other rights.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P131_S1	Accordingly, we recognized $22.4 million, net of discount of $0.4 million, which has been classified as other income in our consolidated statements of earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P131_S2	Prior to this amendment, we earned and received $0.7 million of contingent consideration.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P132_S0	In November 2011, we settled a commercial dispute with third parties that was outside our normal operations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P132_S1	In connection therewith, we received a $10.5 million cash payment, which has been classified as other income in our consolidated statement of earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P133_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P133_S1	The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P133_S2	Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P134_S0	The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 30.6% as compared with 31.8% in fiscal 2012.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P134_S1	The decrease in the effective income tax rate of 120 basis points was principally due to a decrease in the effective tax rate of our foreign operations as compared with fiscal 2012, as well as the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit signed into law on January 2, 2013.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P135_S0	NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P136_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. as compared with fiscal 2012 increased 19%, or $162.9 million, to $1,019.8 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased 20% from $2.16 to $2.58.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P136_S1	The results in fiscal 2013 include the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of $11.7 million, after tax, or $.03 per diluted common share.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P136_S2	The results in fiscal 2012 include the impact of total returns and charges associated with restructuring activities of $44.1 million, after tax, or $.11 per diluted common share.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P137_S0	Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P137_S1	At June 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,629.1 million compared with $1,495.7 million at June 30, 2013.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P137_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P137_S3	To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P138_S0	Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P138_S1	From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P138_S2	To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P139_S0	Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, potential acquisitions and investments, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P139_S1	Our cash and cash equivalents balance at June 30, 2014 includes approximately $1,140 million of cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P139_S2	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P140_S0	The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P140_S1	Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P141_S0	Credit Ratings Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P141_S1	Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P141_S2	Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P142_S0	A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P142_S1	As of August 14, 2014, our commercial paper is rated A-1 by Standard Poor s and P-1 by Moody s and our long-term debt is rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard Poor s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody s.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P143_S0	Debt At June 30, 2014, our outstanding borrowings were as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P144_S0	(1) Consists of $250.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $1.0 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P144_S1	(2) Consists of $300.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $3.4 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P144_S2	(3) Consists of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.2 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P144_S3	(4) Consists of $250.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $0.2 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P144_S4	(5) Consists of $300.0 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $0.2 million and a $21.3 million adjustment to reflect the termination value of interest rate swaps.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P144_S5	(6) The Senior Notes contain certain customary incurrence based covenants, including limitations on indebtedness secured by liens.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P145_S0	We have a $1.0 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P145_S1	As of June 30, 2014, we had no commercial paper outstanding.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P146_S0	In July 2014, we replaced our undrawn $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire on July 14, 2015 (the Prior Facility ), with a new $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on July 15, 2019, unless extended for up to two additional years in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement (the New Facility ).
1001250_14_ITEM7_P146_S1	At June 30, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the Prior Facility.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P146_S2	The New Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P146_S3	Up to the equivalent of $350 million of the New Facility is available for multi-currency loans.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P146_S4	The interest rate on borrowings under the New Facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or % plus the Federal funds rate.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P146_S5	We incurred costs of approximately $1.0 million to establish the New Facility, which costs will be amortized over the term of the facility.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P146_S6	The New Facility has an annual fee of $0.6 million, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P146_S7	The New Facility also contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $150.0 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P147_S0	We have a fixed rate promissory note agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we may borrow up to $150.0 million in the form of loan participation notes through one of our subsidiaries in Europe.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P147_S1	The interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an all-in fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by us at the date of each borrowing.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P147_S2	At June 30, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P147_S3	Debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P148_S0	Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) decreased to 26% at June 30, 2014 from 29% at June 30, 2013.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P149_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,535.2 million, $1,226.3 million and $1,126.7 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P149_S1	The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, an increase in accrued income taxes as a result of the level and timing of tax payments and an increase in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P149_S2	These changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, which primarily reflected accelerated orders in connection with our July 2014 SMI implementation.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P149_S3	Cash flows provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, a decrease in pension and post-retirement benefit contributions and a favorable change in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments and collections.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P149_S4	These improvements were partially offset by an increase in the levels of inventory, primarily to maintain acceptable service levels in line with forecasted sales activity, as well as for the remaining safety stock from the fiscal 2013 SMI implementation.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P149_S5	Also offsetting these improvements were a change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments, and a decrease in accrued income taxes, resulting from the timing and level of tax payments.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P150_S0	Net cash used for investing activities was $511.6 million, $465.5 million and $428.3 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P150_S1	The increase in cash flows used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2013 primarily reflected higher capital expenditure activity in the current year related to leasehold improvements and counters.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P150_S2	The increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 primarily reflected higher capital expenditure activity in fiscal 2013 related to counters and leasehold improvements.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P151_S0	Net cash used for financing activities was $856.9 million, $611.5 million and $585.1 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P151_S1	The increase in cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2013 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases which were partially offset by lower dividend payments that resulted from the transition to quarterly dividends in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and the final annual dividend payment made that year.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P151_S2	In addition, the prior year reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Senior Notes and 2042 Senior Notes, which was partially offset by the redemption of the 2013 Senior Notes and repayment of commercial paper.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P151_S3	The increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 primarily reflected the repayment of outstanding commercial paper during fiscal 2013, higher dividends paid as a result of the increase in the annual dividend rate and transition to a quarterly dividend payout schedule, and higher redemptions of long-term debt during fiscal 2013, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Senior Notes and 2042 Senior Notes in August 2012 and lower treasury stock repurchases.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P152_S0	The following is a summary of cash dividends declared per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during the year ended June 30, 2014:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P153_S0	On August 14, 2014, a dividend was declared in the amount of $.20 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P153_S1	The dividend is payable in cash on September 15, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 29, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P154_S0	Several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P154_S1	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P154_S2	Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ( ERISA ) and subsequent pension legislation, and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P155_S0	For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P155_S1	In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in Item 7.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P156_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P156_S1	The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P157_S0	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P157_S1	This strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P157_S2	For fiscal 2014 and 2013, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under ERISA regulations for the U.S. Qualified Plan.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P157_S3	As we continue to monitor the performance of our plan assets, we may decide to make discretionary cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement plan in the United States during fiscal 2015, but do not have plans to do so at this time.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P158_S0	For fiscal 2014 and 2013, we made benefit payments under our non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of $7.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P158_S1	We expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2015 of approximately $14.4 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P158_S2	For fiscal 2014 and 2013, we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of $27.9 million and $25.9 million, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P158_S3	We expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2015 of approximately $24.0 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P159_S0	Certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn-out provisions.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P159_S1	These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P159_S2	Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P160_S0	For additional contingencies refer to Item 3.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P161_S0	The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of June 30, 2014:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P162_S0	(1) Includes long-term and current debt and the related projected interest costs, and to a lesser extent, capital lease commitments.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P162_S1	Interest costs on long-term and current debt are projected to be $61.3 million in each of the years from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, $44.6 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 and $728.7 million thereafter.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P162_S2	Projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P163_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 9 Debt .
1001250_14_ITEM7_P164_S0	(2) Minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P165_S0	Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, as well as common area maintenance.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P165_S1	These amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P166_S0	(3) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments, estimated future earn-out payments, estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements, advertising commitments, capital improvement commitments, planned funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements, obligations related to our cost savings initiatives and acquisitions.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P166_S1	Future earn-out payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2014, without consideration for potential renewal periods.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P167_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Income Taxes for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P167_S1	As of June 30, 2014, the noncurrent portion of our unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties was $69.5 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P167_S2	At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P168_S0	We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P168_S1	We enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P168_S2	We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P169_S0	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P169_S1	Costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to our consolidated financial results.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P170_S0	For each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain hedge accounting treatment, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P171_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P171_S1	We also formally assess, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P171_S2	If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P172_S0	We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with our identified exposures.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P172_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P173_S0	The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P173_S1	We may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P173_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of June 2016.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P173_S3	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P173_S4	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P173_S5	The ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P173_S6	For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P173_S7	If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to current-period earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P173_S8	As of June 30, 2014, these foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective in all material respects.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P174_S0	At June 30, 2014, we had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,597.3 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P174_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound ($267.2 million), Euro ($239.8 million), Swiss franc ($170.4 million), Canadian dollar ($138.6 million), Australian dollar ($111.3 million), Japanese yen ($108.0 million) and Hong Kong dollar ($103.0 million).
1001250_14_ITEM7_P175_S0	As a matter of policy, we only enter into derivative contracts with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P175_S1	The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P175_S2	Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $4.2 million at June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P175_S3	To manage this risk, we have established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P175_S4	Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P176_S0	Certain of our derivative financial instruments, with two counterparties, contain credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P176_S1	At June 30, 2014, we were in a net liability position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P176_S2	Such credit-risk-related contingent features would be triggered if (a) upon a merger involving the Company, the ratings of the surviving entity were materially weaker than prior to the merger or (b) the Company s credit ratings fall below investment grade (rated below BBB-/Baa3) and the Company fails to enter into an International Swaps Derivatives Association Credit Support Annex within 30 days of being requested by the counterparty.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P177_S0	The fair value of collateral required to settle the instruments immediately if a triggering event were to occur is estimated at approximately the fair value of the contracts.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P177_S1	The fair value of those contracts as of June 30, 2014 was $4.5 million.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P177_S2	As of June 30, 2014, we were in compliance with such credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P178_S0	We use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P178_S1	Value-at-risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P178_S2	We estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250-day period.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P178_S3	The high, low and average measured value-at-risk during fiscal 2014 related to our foreign exchange contracts is as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM7_P179_S0	The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P180_S0	We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P180_S1	Our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P180_S2	It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P180_S3	We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P181_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

1001250_14_ITEM7_P183_S3	Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations.
1001250_14_ITEM7_P183_S4	Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation:

1001250_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	Under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P27_S1	Based on this assessment, the Company s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2014, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, and income taxes.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P57_S2	Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange for the period.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	Unrealized translation gains (losses) reported as cumulative translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. amounted to $95.1 million, $(25.6) million and $(154.2) million, net of tax, in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	For the Company s Venezuelan subsidiary operating in a highly inflationary economy, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P59_S1	Remeasurement adjustments in financial statements in a highly inflationary economy and other transactional gains and losses are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company s consolidated statements of earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted changes to the foreign exchange controls that expanded the use of its existing exchange mechanisms and created another exchange control mechanism ( SICAD II ), which allows companies to apply for the purchase of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated securities for any legal use or purpose.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	As a result, the Company considered its specific facts and circumstances in determining the appropriate remeasurment rate, principally assessing its legal eligibility to access the available foreign exchange mechanisms, the transactions that would be eligible, the Company s past and expected future ability to transact through those mechanisms, and the Company s intent to utilize a particular mechanism for particular purposes.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P60_S2	Although the SICAD II mechanism and its level and frequency of exchange continue to be regulated by the Venezuelan government, it offers the possibility of foreign exchange in a theoretically open market without restricted uses and in management s opinion is the only mechanism legally available at this time for the Company s highest priority transactions, which are the import of goods.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P60_S3	Therefore, the Company believes the SICAD II rate was, and continues to be, the most appropriate rate that reflects the economics of its Venezuelan subsidiary s business as of March 24, 2014, when the SICAD II mechanism became operational.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P60_S4	As a result, the Company changed the exchange rate used to remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan subsidiary from 6.3 to the SICAD II rate, which was 49.98 as of June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P60_S5	Accordingly, a remeasurement charge of $38.3 million, on a before and after tax basis, was reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	Accordingly, the Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange losses on foreign currency transactions, including the effect of the Venezuela remeasurement charge, of $46.7 million, $3.5 million and $0.5 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include $971.9 million and $843.5 million of short-term time deposits at June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P64_S2	As of June 30, 2014, approximately 17% and 16% of the Company s cash and cash equivalents are held by two financial institutions.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	Accounts receivable is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions totaling $23.9 million and $22.7 million as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	Inventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	Cost components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as inbound freight.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P66_S2	Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P66_S3	Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company s customers.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	Included in inventory and promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P67_S2	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P67_S3	In addition, and as necessary, specific reserves for future known or anticipated events may be established.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ( fair-value hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( foreign currency cash-flow hedge), or (iii) not designated as a hedging instrument.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P68_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge that is highly effective are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P68_S3	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a foreign currency cash-flow hedge of a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in OCI.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P68_S4	Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P68_S5	Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company s operating segments.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P76_S2	The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P76_S3	The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P76_S4	Impairment testing is performed in two steps: (i) the Company determines impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	Testing goodwill for impairment requires the Company to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	The assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company uses industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and, in certain instances, the Company engages third-party valuation specialists for advice.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	To determine fair value of the reporting units, the Company generally uses an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P79_S2	In certain circumstances, equal weighting will not be applied if one of these methods may be less applicable (e.g., only the income approach would be used for reporting units with existing negative margins).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P79_S3	The Company believes both approaches are equally relevant and the most reliable indications of fair value because the fair value of product or service companies is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P80_S1	Under the market approach, the Company utilizes information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, to value the reporting unit.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P80_S2	The key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	To determine fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company uses an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P81_S1	This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P81_S2	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P81_S3	Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P82_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	Domestic and international sales are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries, specialty multi-brand retailers and retailers in its travel retail business.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Company grants credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company s largest customer sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for $1,142.7 million, or 10%, $1,078.8 million, or 11%, and $1,048.1 million, or 11%, of the Company s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P85_S1	This customer accounted for $158.5 million, or 11%, and $113.7 million, or 10%, of the Company s accounts receivable at June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P87_S1	In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P87_S2	In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at the Company s retail stores.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company records revenues generated from purchase with purchase promotions in Net Sales and costs of its purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions in Cost of Sales.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P89_S1	The Company s practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested, authorized and approved.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P89_S2	In accepting returns, the Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P89_S3	As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.4% in fiscal 2014, 3.3% in fiscal 2013 and 3.5% in fiscal 2012.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	Certain incentive arrangements require the payment of a fee to customers based on their attainment of pre-established sales levels.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P90_S1	These fees have been recorded as a reduction of Net Sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were not material to the results of operations in any period presented.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	The Company enters into transactions related to demonstrations, advertising and counter construction, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P91_S1	These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P91_S2	The Company s share of the cost of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were approximately $1,410 million, $1,412 million and $1,343 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P92_S0	Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development costs were $2,840.0 million, $2,754.8 million and $2,614.5 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are expensed as incurred.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P92_S1	Excluding the impact of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions, costs for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings were $2,618.1 million, $2,541.0 million and $2,417.6 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P93_S0	During fiscal 2014, the Company conducted a review of the activities and elements of costs associated with its research and development process.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P93_S1	As a result of its review, the Company identified certain activities, such as product innovation and packaging design and development, and their related costs that should be categorized as research and development costs, which continue to be recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P93_S2	As a result, research and development costs totaled $157.9 million, $146.8 million and $137.8 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are expensed as incurred.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	Shipping and handling expenses of $373.6 million, $337.9 million and $312.4 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and include distribution center costs, third-party logistics costs and outbound freight.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	The Company considers lease renewals when such renewals are reasonably assured.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding from its lessors.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P96_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as a reduction of rent expense.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company s license agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors trademarks.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P98_S1	The licenses typically have an initial term of approximately 5 years to 11 years, and are renewable subject to the Company s compliance with the license agreement provisions.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P98_S2	The remaining terms, including the potential renewal periods, range from approximately 6 years to 27 years.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	Most of the Company s licenses were entered into to create new business.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P100_S1	In some cases, the Company acquired, or entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a pre-existing beauty products business.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P100_S2	In those cases, other intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P101_S1	Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P102_S1	Upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock units, performance share units, performance share units based on total stockholder return and market share units, the resulting excess tax benefits, if any, are credited to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P102_S2	Any resulting tax deficiencies will first be offset against those cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P102_S3	If the cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital are exhausted, tax deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P103_S1	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P103_S2	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P103_S3	Based on the Company s assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P103_S4	If the Company determines that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P104_S0	The Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P104_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P104_S2	The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P104_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P104_S4	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P105_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P105_S2	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P106_S0	In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance requiring an entity to present, in a single location either parenthetically on the face of the financial statements or in a separate note, significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ) and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P106_S1	An entity is not permitted to provide this information parenthetically on the face of the income statement if it has items that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P106_S2	Instead of disclosing the income statement line affected, a cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details on these items is required.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P106_S3	This guidance became effective prospectively for the Company s fiscal 2014 first quarter and the adoption of this disclosure-only guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P107_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	In July 2012, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance related to testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P108_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing their indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing further impairment testing.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P108_S2	If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that it is more-likely-than-not that the asset is impaired, a quantitative test is required.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P108_S3	This guidance became effective in the beginning of the Company s fiscal 2014 first quarter and the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P109_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that creates new disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity s rights of offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P109_S1	This revised guidance helps reconcile differences in the offsetting requirements under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P109_S2	These requirements mandate that entities disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P109_S3	In January 2013, the FASB issued an update that limits the scope of these disclosures to recognized derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions to the extent they are offset in the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P109_S4	This disclosure-only guidance became effective for the Company s fiscal 2014 first quarter, with retrospective application required.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P109_S5	The Company currently does not hold any financial or derivative instruments within the scope of this guidance that are offset in its consolidated balance sheets or are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P109_S6	The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	In June 2014, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance on accounting for certain share-based payment awards.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P110_S1	The amended guidance requires that share-based compensation awards with terms of a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P110_S2	As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award and compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P110_S3	This guidance becomes effective for the Company s fiscal 2017 first quarter, with early adoption permitted.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P110_S4	The guidance will permit an entity to apply the amendments in the update either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the consolidated financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P110_S5	The Company will apply this new guidance when it becomes effective, and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines how companies should report revenues from contracts with customers.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P111_S1	The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P111_S2	It provides companies with a single comprehensive five-step principles-based model to use in accounting for revenue and supersedes current revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific and transaction-specific revenue guidance.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P111_S3	This guidance becomes effective for the Company s fiscal 2018 first quarter and early adoption is not permitted.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P111_S4	The guidance permits an entity to apply the standard retrospectively to all prior periods presented, with certain practical expedients, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P111_S5	The Company will apply this new guidance when it becomes effective and has not yet selected a transition method.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which changes the criteria for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P113_S1	This revised standard defines a discontinued operation as (i) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results or (ii) an acquired business or nonprofit activity that is classified as held for sale on the date of acquisition.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P113_S2	The standard also requires expanded disclosures related to discontinued operations and added disclosure requirements for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the discontinued operations criteria.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P113_S3	This guidance becomes effective prospectively for the Company s fiscal 2016 first quarter, with early adoption permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available to be issued.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P113_S4	The Company will apply this new guidance when it becomes effective and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P115_S1	If either (i) an NOL carryforward, a similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward is not available as of the reporting date under the governing tax law to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position or (ii) the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose (provided that the tax law permits a choice), an entity should present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P115_S2	This guidance becomes effective prospectively for unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the Company s fiscal 2015 first quarter, with retrospective application and early adoption permitted.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P115_S3	The Company will apply this new guidance prospectively when it becomes effective, and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to resolve the diversity in practice concerning the release of the cumulative translation adjustment ( CTA ) into net income (i) when a parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity, and (ii) in connection with a step acquisition of a foreign entity.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P116_S1	This amended guidance requires that CTA be released in net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided, and that a pro rata portion of the CTA be released into net income upon a partial sale of an equity method investment in a foreign entity only.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P116_S2	In addition, the amended guidance clarifies the definition of a sale of an investment in a foreign entity to include both, events that result in the loss of a controlling financial interest in a foreign entity and events that result in an acquirer obtaining control of an acquiree in which it held an equity interest immediately prior to the date of acquisition.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P116_S3	The CTA should be released into net income upon the occurrence of such events.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P116_S4	This guidance becomes effective prospectively for the Company s fiscal 2015 first quarter with early adoption permitted.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P116_S5	The Company will apply this new guidance when it becomes effective and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligations within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P117_S1	It does not apply to certain obligations that are addressed within existing guidance in U.S. GAAP.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	This guidance requires an entity to measure in-scope obligations with joint and several liability (e.g., debt arrangements, other contractual obligations, settled litigations, judicial rulings) as the sum of the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and any additional amount it expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P118_S1	In addition, an entity is required to disclose the nature and amount of the obligation.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P118_S2	This guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods for those obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements within the scope of this guidance that exist at the beginning of the Company s fiscal 2015 first quarter, with early adoption permitted.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P118_S3	The Company will apply this guidance when it becomes effective, and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	The cost of assets related to projects in progress of $229.9 million and $178.7 million as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is included in their respective asset categories above.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P120_S1	Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment was $378.1 million, $329.8 million and $286.9 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P120_S2	Depreciation and amortization related to the Company s manufacturing process is included in Cost of sales and all other depreciation and amortization is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	The Company assigns goodwill of a reporting unit to the product category in which that reporting unit predominantly operates at the time of acquisition.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P121_S1	The following table presents goodwill by product category and the related change in the carrying amount:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	Other intangible assets include trademarks and patents, as well as license agreements and other intangible assets resulting from or related to businesses and assets purchased by the Company.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P122_S1	Indefinite-lived intangible assets (e.g., trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are assessed at least annually for impairment during the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P122_S2	Other intangible assets (e.g., non-compete agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately 2 years to 20 years.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	Intangible assets related to license agreements were amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on the terms of the respective agreements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P123_S1	The costs incurred and expensed by the Company to extend or renew the term of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were not significant to the Company s results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	Other intangible assets consist of the following:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	The aggregate amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $12.4 million, $12.5 million and $13.9 million, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P126_S1	The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	As of the Company s annual step-one goodwill impairment test on April 1, 2013, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Darphin reporting unit exceeded its fair value.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P127_S1	As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge for the remainder of the goodwill related to the Darphin reporting unit of $9.6 million.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	The fair value of the reporting unit was based upon the income approach, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P128_S1	The Company also determined that the carrying value of the Darphin trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the use of a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows ( relief-from-royalty method ).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P128_S2	As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $8.1 million for the remaining carrying value of the related trademark.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P128_S3	These impairment charges were reflected in the skin care product category and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa region.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company closed its multi-faceted cost savings program implemented in February 2009 (the Program ) and have executed substantially all remaining initiatives as of June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P129_S1	Total cumulative restructuring charges and other costs to implement those initiatives from inception of the Program to date are $317.5 million.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P136_S0	The provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P137_S0	Earnings before income taxes include amounts contributed by the Company s foreign operations of approximately $1,384 million, $1,220 million and $1,172 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P137_S1	A portion of these earnings are taxed in the United States.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P138_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P139_S0	A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company s actual effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes is as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P140_S0	Income tax reserve adjustments represent changes in the Company s net liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to prior-year tax positions including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P141_S0	Federal income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $2,403 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P141_S1	The Company intends to reinvest these earnings in its foreign operations indefinitely, except where it is able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	The determination and estimation of the future income tax consequences in all relevant taxing jurisdictions involves the application of highly complex tax laws in the countries involved, particularly in the United States, and is based on the tax profile of the Company in the year of earnings repatriation.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P142_S1	Accordingly, it is not practicable to determine the amount of tax associated with such undistributed earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P143_S0	Significant components of the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P144_S0	As of June 30, 2014 and 2013, the Company had current net deferred tax assets of $295.1 million and $296.0 million, respectively, substantially all of which are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P144_S1	In addition, the Company had noncurrent net deferred tax assets of $85.5 million and $50.3 million as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, substantially all of which are included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P145_S1	With the exception of approximately $412 million of net operating loss and other carryforwards with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 30, 2014, these carryforwards expire at various dates through fiscal 2034.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P145_S2	Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, in the amount of $11.1 million and $9.0 million as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, have been recorded to reflect the tax benefits of the carryforwards not utilized to date.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P146_S0	A full valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P149_S0	The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P149_S1	During fiscal 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized gross interest and penalty benefits of $1.7 million and $8.2 million, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P151_S0	Compliance Assurance Program ( CAP ).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P151_S1	The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of income tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P152_S0	During the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013, the Company formally concluded the compliance process with respect to fiscal years 2011 and 2012, respectively, under the IRS CAP.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P152_S1	The conclusion of this process did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P152_S2	As of June 30, 2014, the compliance process was ongoing with respect to fiscal years 2013 and 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P153_S0	The Company is currently undergoing income tax examinations and controversies in several state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P153_S1	These matters are in various stages of completion and involve complex multi-jurisdictional issues common among multinational enterprises, including transfer pricing, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P154_S0	The Company had been notified of a disallowance of tax deductions claimed by its subsidiary in Spain for fiscal years 1999 through 2002.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P154_S1	An appeal against this reassessment was filed with the Chief Tax Inspector.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P154_S2	On July 18, 2005, the final assessment made by the Chief Tax Inspector was received, confirming the reassessment made by the tax auditors.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P155_S0	During fiscal 2006, an appeal against this final assessment was filed with the Madrid Regional Economic Administrative Tribunal ( TEAR ).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P155_S1	In view of the TEAR s silence, during fiscal 2007 the claim was presumed to be dismissed and an appeal was filed against it with the Central Economic-Administrative Tribunal ( TEAC ).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P155_S2	During the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter, the TEAC dismissed the claim and, on June 10, 2008, the Company filed an appeal for judicial review with the National Appellate Court.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P155_S3	During fiscal 2009, the Company completed the appeal proceedings with the National Appellate Court and, as of June 30, 2011, awaited the court s decision.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P155_S4	During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the National Appellate Court notified the Company that the appeal was denied.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P155_S5	The Company had been assessed corporate income tax and interest of $3.8 million, net of tax, at current exchange rates.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P155_S6	In response, the Company filed an appeal with the Spain Supreme Court.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P155_S7	Based on the decision of the National Appellate Court, the Company established a reserve during fiscal 2012 which resulted in an increase to the provision for income taxes equal to the $3.8 million exposure, net of tax.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P155_S8	Separately, during fiscal 2012, the Company s subsidiary in Spain made cash payments totaling $4.1 million, at current exchange rates, to the Spain tax authority as an advance deposit to limit the additional interest that would be due to the Spain tax authority should it receive an unfavorable decision from the Spain Supreme Court.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P155_S9	During the second quarter of fiscal 2014, the Spain Supreme Court notified the Company that its appeal was denied.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P155_S10	Since this represents the final outcome of the matter, the Company applied the advance deposit to settle the assessment and previously established reserve.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P156_S0	During fiscal 2014, the Company concluded various state, local and foreign income tax audits and examinations while several other matters, including those noted above, were initiated or remained pending.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P156_S1	On the basis of the information available in this regard as of June 30, 2014, the Company does not expect any significant changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P169_S0	As of June 30, 2014, the Company had outstanding $321.1 million of 2017 Senior Notes consisting of $300.0 million principal, an unamortized debt discount of $0.2 million and a $21.3 million adjustment to reflect the remaining termination value of an interest rate swap.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P169_S1	The 2017 Senior Notes, when issued in May 2007, were priced at 99.845% with a yield of 5.570%.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P169_S2	Interest payments are required to be made semi-annually on May 15 and November 15.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P169_S3	During fiscal 2011, the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $250.0 million which had effectively converted the fixed rate interest on its outstanding 2017 Senior Notes to variable interest rates.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P169_S4	The instrument, which was classified as an asset, had a fair value of $47.4 million at the date of cash settlement.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P169_S5	Hedge accounting treatment was discontinued prospectively and the fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt is being amortized against interest expense over the remaining life of the debt.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P170_S0	In September 2012, the Company used the net proceeds of the 2022 Senior Notes and 2042 Senior Notes to redeem the $230.1 million principal amount of its 2013 Senior Notes at a price of 108% of the principal amount and recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P171_S0	The Company has a $1.0 billion commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper in the United States.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P171_S1	At June 30, 2014, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P172_S1	The interest rate on borrowings under this agreement is at an all-in fixed rate determined by the lender and agreed to by the Company at the date of each borrowing.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P172_S2	At June 30, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P172_S3	Debt issuance costs incurred related to this agreement were de minimis.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P173_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P174_S0	In July 2014, the Company replaced its undrawn $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire on July 14, 2015 (the Prior Facility ), with a new $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on July 15, 2019, unless extended for up to two additional years in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement (the New Facility ).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P174_S1	At June 30, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the Prior Facility.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P174_S2	The New Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P174_S3	Up to the equivalent of $350 million of the New Facility is available for multi-currency loans.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P174_S4	The interest rate on borrowings under the New Facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or % plus the Federal funds rate.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P174_S5	The Company incurred costs of approximately $1 million to establish the New Facility which will be amortized over the term of the facility.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P174_S6	The New Facility has an annual fee of $0.6 million, payable quarterly, based on the Company s current credit ratings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P174_S7	The New Facility also contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $150.0 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P175_S0	The Company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P175_S1	Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P175_S2	During fiscal 2014 and 2013, the monthly average amount outstanding was approximately $13.7 million and $11.8 million, respectively, and the annualized monthly weighted-average interest rate incurred was approximately 9.2% and 8.8%, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P176_S0	Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies for the Company s projected debt service payments, as of June 30, 2014, over the next five fiscal years.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P177_S0	The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P177_S1	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company s aggregate liability portfolio.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P177_S2	The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P177_S3	The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P177_S4	Costs associated with entering into these derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company s consolidated financial results.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P178_S0	For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P179_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P179_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P179_S2	If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P180_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P181_S0	The fair values of the Company s derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets are presented as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P182_S0	(1) See Note 11 Fair Value Measurements for further information about how the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities are determined.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P183_S0	The amounts of the gains and losses related to the Company s derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are presented as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P184_S0	(1) The amount of gain recognized in earnings related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing was $0.4 million and $1.8 million for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P184_S1	The loss recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationships was $0.5 million and $0.2 million for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P185_S0	The amounts of the gains and losses related to the Company s derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments are presented as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P186_S0	Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P187_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P188_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P188_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P189_S0	The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P189_S1	The Company may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P189_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as foreign currency cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of June 2016.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P189_S3	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P189_S4	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P190_S0	The ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P190_S1	For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P190_S2	If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P191_S0	As of June 30, 2014, the Company s foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective in all material respects.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P191_S1	The estimated net loss as of June 30, 2014 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $6.5 million.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P191_S2	The accumulated gain (loss) on derivative instruments in AOCI was $(12.5) million and $16.9 million as of June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P192_S0	At June 30, 2014, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,597.3 million.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P192_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound ($267.2 million), Euro ($239.8 million), Swiss franc ($170.4 million), Canadian dollar ($138.6 million), Australian dollar ($111.3 million), Japanese yen ($108.0 million) and Hong Kong dollar ($103.0 million).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P193_S0	At June 30, 2013, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,579.6 million.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P193_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound ($426.2 million), Euro ($268.8 million), Canadian dollar ($198.6 million), Swiss franc ($111.5 million), Australian dollar ($92.1 million), Thailand baht ($75.5 million) and Hong Kong dollar ($58.1 million).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P194_S0	The Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the identified exposures.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P195_S0	As a matter of policy, the Company only enters into derivative contracts with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P195_S1	The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P195_S2	Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $4.2 million at June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P195_S3	To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P195_S4	Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P196_S0	Certain of the Company s derivative financial instruments, with two counterparties, contain credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P196_S1	At June 30, 2014, the Company was in a net liability position for certain derivative contracts that contain such features.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P196_S2	Such credit-risk-related contingent features would be triggered if (a) upon a merger involving the Company, the ratings of the surviving entity were materially weaker than prior to the merger or (b) the Company s credit ratings fall below investment grade (rated below BBB-/Baa3) and the Company fails to enter into an International Swaps Derivatives Association Credit Support Annex within 30 days of being requested by the counterparty.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P197_S0	The fair value of collateral required to settle the instruments immediately if a triggering event were to occur is estimated at approximately the fair value of the contracts.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P197_S1	The fair value of those contracts as of June 30, 2014 was $4.5 million.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P197_S2	As of June 30, 2014, the Company was in compliance with such credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P198_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P199_S0	The Company records its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P199_S1	The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations, goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment, and liabilities associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P200_S0	The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P200_S1	The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P201_S0	Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P202_S0	Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P203_S0	Level 3: Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P203_S1	The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument s valuation.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P204_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2014:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P205_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2013:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P206_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy and impairment charges for certain of its nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2013:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P207_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P208_S0	To determine the fair value of the Darphin reporting unit at April 1, 2013, the Company used the income approach.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P208_S1	Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of the reporting unit.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P208_S2	For the Darphin reporting unit, negative cash flows in future forecasted periods would not support a value in excess of carrying value at that time and therefore the Company concluded that all remaining goodwill was fully impaired.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P209_S0	To determine fair value of the Darphin trademark at April 1, 2013, the Company assessed the future performance of the related reporting unit and determined that negative cash flows in future forecasted periods would not support a royalty rate for the calculation of fair value of the trademark at that time.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P209_S1	The Company therefore concluded that the carrying value of this asset was not recoverable.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P210_S0	See Note 5 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion of the Company s impairment testing.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P211_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company s other classes of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P212_S0	The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P213_S0	Available-for-sale securities Available-for-sale securities are generally comprised of mutual funds and are valued using quoted market prices on an active exchange.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P213_S1	Available-for-sale securities are included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P214_S0	Note receivable During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company amended the agreement related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields (a brand then owned by the Company) to receive a fixed amount in lieu of future contingent consideration and other rights.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P214_S1	The fair value of the receivable under the amended agreement was determined by discounting the future cash flows using an implied market rate of 6.1%.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P214_S2	This implied market rate reflects the Company s estimate of interest rates prevailing in the market for notes with comparable remaining maturities, the creditworthiness of the counterparty, and an assessment of the ultimate collectability of the instrument.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P214_S3	The implied market rate is deemed to be an unobservable input and as such the Company s note receivable is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P214_S4	An increase or decrease in the risk premium of 100 basis points would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the receivable.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P214_S5	See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on the amended agreement.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P215_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P215_S1	The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P215_S2	To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to 12 months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than 12 months.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P216_S0	Current and long-term debt The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P216_S1	To a lesser extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P216_S2	The Company s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P217_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P218_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P219_S0	The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P219_S1	Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P219_S2	In certain instances, the Company adjusts benefits in connection with international employee transfers.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P220_S0	The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P220_S1	The Company s funding policy consists of contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P220_S2	Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ), as amended, and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P221_S0	The Company also has an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P222_S0	The Company maintains international pension plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P222_S1	The Company s funding policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P222_S2	The Company s most significant defined benefit pension obligations are included in the plan summaries below.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P223_S0	The Company maintains a domestic post-retirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P223_S1	Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they retire.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P223_S2	Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P223_S3	Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the retiree.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P223_S4	It is the Company s practice to fund these benefits as incurred and to provide discretionary funding for the future liability up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P224_S0	Certain of the Company s international subsidiaries and affiliates have post-retirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P226_S0	The significant components of the above mentioned plans as of and for the years ended June 30 are summarized as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P227_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P228_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P228_S1	The discount rate for the Company s Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P228_S2	The Company used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of the Company s Domestic Plans.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P228_S3	For the Company s international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P229_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P230_S0	Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P230_S1	The assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate for the coming year is 7.10% while the weighted-average ultimate trend rate of 4.54% is expected to be reached in approximately 14 years.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P230_S2	A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2014 would have had the following effects:

1001250_14_ITEM15_P260_S0	Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, as well as common area maintenance.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P260_S1	These amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P260_S2	Such amounts have not been material to total rent expense.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P260_S3	Total rental expense included in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was $356.1 million, $332.4 million and $304.9 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P264_S0	The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its business.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P264_S1	Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P264_S2	However, management s assessment of the Company s current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company, not presently known to the Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P264_S3	Except as disclosed below, reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P265_S0	During the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter, the former owner of the Darphin brand initiated litigation in the Paris Commercial Court against the Company and one of its subsidiaries seeking to recover 60.0 million ($81.9 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2014) that he claims he was owed as additional consideration for the sale of Darphin to the Company in April 2003.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P265_S1	On December 23, 2011, the Paris Commercial Court issued its judgment, awarding the former owner 22.9 million ($31.3 million at the exchange rate at June 30, 2014) plus interest from 2007.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P265_S5	Based upon its assessment of the case, as well as the advice of external counsel, the Company is maintaining the amount it previously accrued as an amount that it believes will ultimately be paid based on the probable outcome of the appeal.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P265_S6	Such amount is less than the Paris Commercial Court s award.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P266_S0	During the fiscal 2013 second quarter, the Company amended the agreement related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields (a brand then owned by the Company) to receive a fixed amount in lieu of future contingent consideration and other rights.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P281_S0	(1) The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P282_S0	The exercise period for all stock options generally may not exceed ten years from the date of grant.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P283_S0	Stock option grants to individuals generally become exercisable in three substantively equal tranches over a service period of up to four years.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P285_S0	The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P286_S0	The Company uses a weighted-average expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P286_S1	The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P287_S0	For the weighted-average expected option life assumption, the Company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P287_S1	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate for the expected term of the options and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience.

1001250_14_ITEM15_P295_S0	During fiscal 2013, the Company granted PSUs to an executive of the Company with an aggregate target payout of 162,760 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock, subject to continued employment through the end of the relative performance periods, which end June 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P295_S1	Such PSUs will be settled based upon the Company s relative total stockholder return ( TSR ) over the relevant performance period as compared to companies in the S P 500 on July 1, 2012.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P295_S2	No settlement will occur if the Company s TSR falls below a minimum threshold, and up to an aggregate of 260,416 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock will be issued depending on the extent to which the Company s TSR equals or exceeds the minimum threshold.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P295_S3	The PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the PSUs.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P296_S0	The grant date fair value of the PSUs of $11.0 million was estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions for each performance period, respectively: contractual life of 33, 45 and 57 months, average risk-free interest rate of 0.3%, 0.5% and 0.7% and a dividend yield of 1.0%.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P297_S0	Using the historical stock prices and dividends from public sources, the Company estimated the covariance structure of the returns on S P 500 stocks.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P297_S1	The volatility for the Company s stock produced by this estimation was 32%.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P297_S2	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rates over the contractual term of the grant and the dividend yield is based on historical experience.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P298_S0	During fiscal 2014, the Company had one outstanding market share unit, which vested on June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P298_S1	The market share unit had a grant date fair value of $10.6 million that was estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions: contractual life of 41 months, a weighted-average expected volatility of 29%, a weighted-average risk-free interest rate of 1.6% and a weighted-average dividend yield of 1.0%.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P299_S0	The Company used an expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities from options on the underlying stock.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P299_S1	The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P299_S2	The expected life was equal to the contractual term of the grant.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P299_S3	The average risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury strip rates over the contractual term of the grant and the average dividend yield was based on historical experience.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P299_S4	In accordance with the terms of the grant, the maximum award of 320,000 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock are anticipated to be issued, and related dividends to be paid, based upon the average closing stock price per share of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the last 20 trading days ending on June 30, 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P300_S0	The Company grants share units to certain non-employee directors under the Non-Employee Director Share Incentive Plan.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P300_S1	The share units are convertible into shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock as provided for in that plan.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P300_S2	Share units are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that are converted to additional share units when such dividends are declared.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P301_S0	The following is a summary of the status of the Company s share units as of June 30, 2014 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P302_S0	Certain non-employee directors defer cash compensation in the form of cash payout share units, which are not subject to the Plans.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P302_S1	These share units are classified as liabilities and, as such, their fair value is adjusted to reflect the current market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P302_S2	The Company recorded $2.4 million, $3.0 million and $0.8 million as compensation expense to reflect additional deferrals and the change in the market value for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P303_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P304_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share ( basic EPS ) is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain conditions).
1001250_14_ITEM15_P304_S1	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share assuming dilution ( diluted EPS ) is computed by reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P305_S0	A reconciliation between the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P306_S0	As of June 30, 2014 and 2013, 0.1 million outstanding stock options were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P306_S1	As of June 30, 2012, outstanding stock options that were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive were de minimis.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P306_S2	As of June 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 0.5 million, 0.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively, of PSUs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement of certain performance targets of the Company, as discussed in Note 15 Stock Programs.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P307_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P308_S0	The components of AOCI included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consist of the following:

1001250_14_ITEM15_P312_S0	(4) See Note 12 Pension, Deferred Compensation and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans for additional information.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P313_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P314_S0	Supplemental cash flow information is as follows:
1001250_14_ITEM15_P315_S0	Reportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Chief Executive ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P315_S1	As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P316_S0	Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P317_S0	While the Company s results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P317_S1	Accordingly, net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P317_S2	These product categories meet the definition of operating segments and, accordingly, additional financial data are provided below.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P318_S0	The other segment includes the sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P319_S0	Product category performance is measured based upon net sales before returns associated with restructuring activities, and earnings before income taxes, other income, net interest expense, interest expense on debt extinguishment and total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P319_S1	Returns and charges associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to the product categories because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide program to redesign the Company s organizational structure.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P319_S2	The accounting policies for the Company s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales.
1001250_14_ITEM15_P319_S3	The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.

1001250_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	At in-store counters, consumers are offered a High-Touch experience with personal consultations to market individual products as well as to provide education on their use and application.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	We conduct extensive sampling programs, and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	We believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our High-Touch approach promotes the total value we offer by leveraging our in-person and virtual assets, as well as merchandising and education, to provide a customized consumer experience.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	To support this initiative, we continue to expand our online strategy into a multi-pronged digital strategy that encompasses e-commerce, m-commerce, as well as digital and social media.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	We have dedicated resources to implement coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P51_S3	We continue to use the Internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P51_S4	Currently, 16 of our brands have marketing websites.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P51_S5	In order to continue to offer unparalleled service and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online, we partner with key brick and mortar retailers to strengthen their e-commerce business and drive sales of our brands on their websites, continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), and support e-commerce and m-commerce business via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house creative teams.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	The creative staff designs and produces the sales materials, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development costs were $2,840.0 million, $2,754.8 million and $2,614.5 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	These amounts include activities relating to purchase with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales, and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in cost of sales.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	Information systems support business processes including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	We expect that these systems will continue to provide pertinent inventory and sales data in the short term.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	As part of our long-term effort to enhance these systems and increase productivity, we continue to implement our Strategic Modernization Initiative ( SMI ), which includes an enterprise-wide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands, operating units and sales locations.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P54_S3	As part of SMI, we rolled out the last of our four major waves of SAP-based technologies ( SAP ) in July 2014.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P54_S4	With the July rollout, locations representing approximately 93% of our consolidated net sales are SAP-enabled.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P54_S5	We plan to continue the implementation of SAP at our remaining locations through fiscal 2017.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	In parallel with our SAP deployment, we are creating a more focused global information technology organization utilizing industry standard processes, which we expect will benefit, among other things, our demand planning process.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	We are also exploring opportunities to create a more efficient organization by rebalancing our information technology resources to better align with our global business growth.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	As we continue to modernize our key processes and the related systems and infrastructure, we are developing upgraded capabilities to support our human resource and retail operations.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our plan is to progressively develop and deploy key systems globally over the next several years.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	Of the many systems currently being utilized, the most significant to our business needs are: (i) a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer, or plan to offer, which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality; (ii) a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit ( SKU ) level at the most significant retail sales locations (i.e. sell-through data), increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development, manufacturing and marketing strategies; (iii) an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers, allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically, with minimal paperwork; and (iv) an inventory management system that provides us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to forecasted requirements.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	Our research and development group, which includes scientists and other employees involved in product innovation and packaging design and development, works closely with our marketing and product development teams to cultivate ideas, develop new products and product-line extensions, and create new packaging concepts, as well as to improve, redesign or reformulate existing products.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	In addition, these research and development personnel provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how to quality and assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	The research and development group has long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Members of the research and development group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	During fiscal 2014, we conducted a review of the activities and elements of costs associated with our research and development process as described above.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	As a result of our review, we identified certain activities, such as product innovation and packaging design and development, and their related costs that should be categorized as research and development costs, which continue to be recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	As a result, our research and development costs totaled $157.9 million, $146.8 million and $137.8 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P59_S3	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P59_S4	As of June 30, 2014, we had approximately 700 employees engaged in research and development activities.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P59_S5	We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see Item 2.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	We do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, nor ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	We manufacture our products primarily in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies, minimize our impact on the environment and reduce costs.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P61_S2	Our major manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily manufacture one category of product (e.g., makeup) for all of the principal brands.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P61_S3	Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P61_S4	While we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and third party manufacturers is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity, technology and productivity.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P61_S5	To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize a network of third-party manufacturers on a global basis, including an increased percentage of volume in Asia/Pacific to support our growth.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	We have continued to establish regional distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations department.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P63_S3	We have made a concentrated effort in supplier rationalization and continue to review our supplier base with the specific objective of reducing costs, increasing innovation and speed to market and improving quality.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P63_S4	In addition, we continue to focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P63_S5	As a result of sourcing initiatives, there is increased dependency on certain suppliers, but we believe that our portfolio of these suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	We are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will change suppliers, and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	The skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition throughout the world.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact consumers choices among competing products and brands.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P66_S2	Advertising, promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store demonstrations also have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	With our numerous brands, sold in various channels, we are one of the world s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names.

1001250_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	We protect our trademarks in the United States and significant markets worldwide.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	In addition, several products and packaging for such products are covered by design patents or copyrights.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P72_S2	While we consider these patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is considered material to the conduct of our business.

1001250_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	A limited number of employees outside of the United States are covered by a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, advertising, shipment, disposal and safety of our products.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P74_S2	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable federal, state, local and international and other countries rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment or that relate to climate change.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	There are no significant capital expenditures for environmental control or climate change matters either planned in the current year or expected in the near future.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	Many of our customers that are retailers follow a 4-4-5 retail calendar which may influence the amount and timing of their order placement and receipt of goods in any fiscal quarter.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	In a traditional 4-4-5 retail calendar, each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	As a result, our customers retail quarter-end and our fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions.
1001250_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.

1001250_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading prices of our securities, may be adversely affected.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors actions in these areas.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A consolidation in the retail trade may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	This could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	A severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In addition, certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We must continually work to develop, manufacture and market new products, maintain and adapt our High-Touch services to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, successfully manage our inventories, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The issue is compounded by the increasing use of social and digital media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our financial results will suffer.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Achieving our long-term strategy will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These investments may result in short-term costs without any current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings, at least in the short term.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We continuously review acquisition and investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If required, the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks, which may include:
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from, or customers of, acquired businesses; diversion of management s attention from our existing businesses; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, and any adverse consequences associated with our acquisition activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	A general economic downturn, or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P18_S5	We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P18_S7	If a retailer was to liquidate, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer s inventory of our products to protect brand equity.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or local or international conflicts around the world, or as a result of a terrorist attack, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation, or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes or seismic events, can have a short-term and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Events that impact consumers willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business, including travel retail, a significant contributor to our overall results, and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	A downturn in the economies of, or continuing recessions in, the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence, the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We are seeing continued softness in certain Southern European countries and Korea due to challenging economic environments, as well as intensifying competitive pressures globally.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Elsewhere, we are cautious of an uncertain retail environment in the United States in the short term, unfavorable foreign exchange rates in certain emerging countries, and the lower growth rates we have been experiencing in China.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We also continue to see an adverse impact of Chinese government actions on the travel and spending of Chinese consumers, which are affecting sales in the travel retail channel, at their travel destinations and within their home market.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	While we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements, such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, laws and regulations relating to data privacy, anti-corruption, advertising, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, product registration, ingredients, chemicals and packaging, laws in Europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are involved, and may become involved in the future, in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that, if adversely decided or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, other disputes or regulatory proceedings.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In general, claims made by us or against us in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	As we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, our product claims are found to be deceptive, or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers expectations, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and/or become subject to liability or claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our key personnel.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Competition for these employees can be intense.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P33_S4	We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P33_S5	This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are subject to risks related to our foreign operations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We operate on a global basis, with a majority of our fiscal 2014 net sales and operating income generated outside the United States.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely, except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	A significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the United States.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	adverse weather conditions, currency exchange controls, and social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	A disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Some of our products rely on single or a limited number of suppliers.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Further, the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities, in compliance with applicable standards, and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our information systems and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches, outages, and other risks.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We have information systems that support our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We have e-commerce, m-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P45_S4	The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain information that is confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive, including personal information with respect to customers and employees.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Moreover, the success of our e-commerce and m-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees and customers personal information, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees and customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P47_S5	In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We are subject to risks associated with implementing global information systems.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	As part of our Strategic Modern Initiative ( SMI ), we are implementing enterprise-wide global programs intended to deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands, regions and functions.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We are also implementing other systems, including global human resource management systems and retail operating systems.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Like most entity-wide changes to software systems, the implementation of SMI and other systems involve risks and uncertainties.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Failure to implement SMI and other systems as planned, in terms of timing, specifications and/or costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	As we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	As part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	These include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations, and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal 2014, we provided guidance as to a number of assumptions, including our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2014 and the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P55_S4	While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P55_S5	In addition, the longer-term guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P55_S6	Such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our net sales and/or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q).
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P56_S2	These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P57_S3	If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P57_S5	We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We are controlled by the Lauder family.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	As a result of their control of us, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As of August 14, 2014, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having 86.7% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In addition, there are four members of the Lauder family who are employees, including three who are members of our Board of Directors.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P59_S3	As a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the Company, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including, without limitation, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets, for the foreseeable future.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a controlled company under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	As a controlled company, we are exempt under the New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities; and that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	While we have voluntarily caused our Board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and the Compensation Committee to have the required provisions, we are not requiring our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and Compensation Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors.
1001250_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As a result of our use of the controlled company exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.
1001250_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following table sets forth our principal owned and leased manufacturing, assembly, research and development and distribution facilities as of August 14, 2014.

1001250_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	Senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis, and we believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	Our largest customer, Macy s Inc., sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for 10% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 and 11% for fiscal 2013, and 12% and 11% of our accounts receivable as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our strategy to market and promote our products begins with our well-diversified portfolio of more than 25 distinctive brands across four product categories.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	We strive to be locally relevant with the marketing and visual merchandising of our products and services across an array of developed and emerging markets within the channels of distribution in which we operate.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	This strategy is built around Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	Mrs. Est e Lauder formulated this unique marketing philosophy to provide High-Touch service and high quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P46_S4	Our High-Touch approach is demonstrated through our integrated consumer engagement models that leverage our product specialists and technology to provide the consumer with a distinct experience that can include personal consultations with beauty advisors, in person or online, who demonstrate and educate the consumer on product usage and application.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our marketing strategies vary by brand and local market.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our diverse portfolio of brands employ different engagement models suited to each brand s equity, distribution, product focus and understanding of the core consumer.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	This enables us to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new customers, build loyalty and drive advocacy.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	Our marketing planning approach leverages local insights to optimize allocation of resources across different media outlets and retail touch points to resonate with our most discerning consumers most effectively.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house creative teams that design and produce the sales materials, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	We build brand equity and drive traffic to retail locations and to our websites through magazines and newspapers, digital and social media, television, billboards in cities and airports, and direct mail and email.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	In addition, we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products not only in publications and other traditional media, but increasingly in digital and social media, leveraging significant opportunities for amplification.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	We are increasing our brand awareness and sales by expanding our digital presence encompassing e-commerce and m-commerce, as well as digital and social media.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	In order to continue to offer unparalleled service and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online, we continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), support e-commerce and m-commerce businesses via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement, and support our authorized retailers to strengthen their e-commerce businesses and drive sales of our brands on their websites.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	We have opportunities to expand our balanced brand portfolio online around the world, and we are in the early stages of developing and testing omnichannel concepts to better serve consumers as they shop across channels.

1001250_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	Promotional activities and in-store displays are designed to attract new consumers and introduce existing consumers to other product offerings from the respective brands.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as purchase with purchase and gift with purchase.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	Such activities attract consumers to our counters and keep existing consumers engaged.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers, retailers, beauty consultants and makeup artists at the points of sale.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P50_S4	We pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P50_S5	We conduct extensive sampling programs, and continue to believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	Information systems support business processes including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	We continue to maintain and enhance these systems in alignment with our long-term strategy.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Certain elements of our information technology infrastructure are managed by third-party providers.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	In fiscal 2015, we completed the last major wave of our multi-year Strategic Modernization Initiative ( SMI ), and most of our locations are currently enabled with SAP-based technologies ( SAP ).
1001250_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	The SMI program is delivering benefits and efficiencies in process standardization and has positioned us to achieve additional capabilities to drive value in the future.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	We are leveraging our SMI foundation by implementing initiatives that are focused on global efficiencies.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	We continue to explore additional opportunities that we expect will bring incremental savings, innovation and value creation to the business through new capabilities.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	In addition, we continue to develop and invest in new data insight and analytic capabilities to allow us to more effectively utilize the information provided by SAP and strategic sources of both internal and external data.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	As we continue to modernize our key processes, related systems and infrastructure, we are also developing upgraded capabilities to support our human resource ( HR ) operations, and we plan to progressively and strategically develop and deploy key systems globally over the next few years that will provide managers and employees with self-service HR capabilities.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	During fiscal 2015, we completed the deployment of our core HR transformation program in North America, and in fiscal 2016 we will focus on other geographical regions.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	In addition, we are making investments to upgrade our retail systems and retail capabilities globally.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P54_S3	The retail system upgrades are expected to enhance the effectiveness of store operations, and support our omnichannel objectives.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P54_S4	Over the next few years, we will continue to implement upgraded point of sale, retail merchandising, and retail workforce management solutions in certain key markets globally.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our research and development group, which includes scientists and other employees involved in product innovation and packaging design and development, works closely with our marketing and product development teams to cultivate ideas, develop new products and product-line extensions, and create new packaging concepts, as well as to improve, redesign or reformulate existing products.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	In addition, these research and development personnel provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how to quality and assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products that meet or exceed consumer expectations.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	The research and development group has long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	Members of the research and development group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters.

1001250_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies, minimize our impact on the environment and reduce costs.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	Our major manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily manufacture one category of product (e.g., makeup) for all of the principal brands.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	While we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and third-party manufacturers is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity, technology and productivity.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P59_S5	To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize a network of third-party manufacturers on a global basis.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	We have established regional distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations department.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P61_S3	We review our supplier base periodically with the specific objectives of improving quality, increasing innovation and speed-to-market and reducing costs.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P61_S4	In addition, we focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P61_S5	Some of our products rely on a single or limited number of suppliers; however, we believe that our portfolio of suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P61_S6	In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	We are continually benchmarking the performance of our supply chain and will change suppliers and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	There is vigorous competition within each market where our skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products are sold.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact consumers choices among competing products and brands.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P63_S2	Advertising, promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store demonstrations also have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	With our numerous brands, sold in various channels, we are one of the world s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.

1001250_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	In addition, several products and packaging for such products are covered by design patents or copyrights.

1001250_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, advertising, shipment, disposal and safety of our products.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P71_S2	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable federal, state, local and international and other countries rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment or that relate to climate change.

1001250_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P73_S2	Many of our customers that are retailers follow a 4-4-5 retail calendar which may influence the amount and timing of their order placement and receipt of goods in any fiscal quarter.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	In a traditional 4-4-5 retail calendar, each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	As a result, our customers retail quarter-end and our fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions.
1001250_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.

1001250_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading prices of our securities, may be adversely affected.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors actions in these areas.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	A consolidation in the retail trade may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	This could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	A severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If one or more of our largest customers change their strategies (including pricing or promotional activities) or change or terminate their relationship with us, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	In addition, certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We must continually work to develop, manufacture and market new products, maintain and adapt our High-Touch services to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, successfully manage our inventories, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The issue is compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	If we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our financial results will suffer.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Achieving our long-term strategy will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These investments may result in short-term costs without any current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings, at least in the short term.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We continuously review acquisition and investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If required, the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future, a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results, then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks, which may include: difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from, or customers of, acquired businesses; diversion of management s attention from our existing businesses; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business; and risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, and any adverse consequences associated with our acquisition activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	A general economic downturn, or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P12_S6	We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P12_S8	If a retailer was to liquidate, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer s inventory of our products to protect brand equity.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, as a consequence of events such as a pandemic or local or international conflicts around the world, or as a result of a terrorist attack, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation, or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes or seismic events, can have a short-term and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Events that impact consumers willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business, including travel retail, a significant contributor to our overall results, and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	A downturn in the economies of, or continuing recessions in, the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence, the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We remain cautious of slower retail growth in Hong Kong and China, a decline in spending by Russian and Brazilian travelers, unfavorable foreign exchange due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies, and lower net sales from our travel retail business in Korea, one of our largest markets for travel retail, due to a decrease in the number of travelers there as a result of the recent outbreak of the MERS virus.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Additionally we are monitoring the effects of economic instability in Russia, Greece and Brazil.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	While we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements, such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, laws and regulations relating to data privacy, anti-corruption, advertising, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, product registration, ingredients, chemicals and packaging, laws in Europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We are involved, and may become involved in the future, in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that, if adversely decided or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, other disputes or regulatory proceedings.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In general, claims made by us or against us in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways, including the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, our product claims are found to be deceptive, or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers expectations, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and/or become subject to liability or claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our key personnel.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Competition for these employees can be intense.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P23_S6	This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are subject to risks related to our foreign operations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We operate on a global basis, with a majority of our fiscal 2015 net sales and operating income generated outside the United States.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely, except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	A majority of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the United States.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including: fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places, which can affect our results of operations, the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets, the cost of certain inventory and non-inventory items required in our operations, and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets; foreign laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on trade, import and export license requirements, and tariffs and taxes, as well as United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade, operations and investment; lack of well-established or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate; and adverse weather conditions, currency exchange controls, and social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Some of our products rely on single or a limited number of suppliers.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Further, the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities, in compliance with applicable standards, and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our information systems and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches, outages, and other risks.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We have information systems that support our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We have e-commerce, m-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and other events.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P30_S5	The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain information that is confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive, including personal information with respect to customers and employees.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Moreover, the success of our e-commerce and m-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees and customers personal information, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees and customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P32_S5	In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We are subject to risks associated with our global information systems.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our implementation of global information systems, including supply chain and finance systems, human resource management systems and retail operating systems, involves risks and uncertainties.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Failure to implement and maintain these and other systems as planned, in terms of timing, specifications, costs, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	As we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	As part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	These include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations, and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, if we transition systems to one or more new, or among existing, external service providers, we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal 2015, we provided guidance as to certain assumptions, including ranges for our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2015 and the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P36_S5	While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P36_S6	In addition, the longer-term guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P36_S7	Such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our net sales and/or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q).
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are controlled by the Lauder family.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	As a result of their control of us, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	As of August 14, 2015, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having approximately 87% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, there are four members of the Lauder family who are employees, including three who are members of our Board of Directors.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	As a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the Company, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including, without limitation, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets, for the foreseeable future.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a controlled company under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	As a controlled company, we are exempt under the New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements: that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities; and that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	While we have voluntarily caused our Board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and the Compensation Committee to have the required provisions, we are not requiring our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and Compensation Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors.
1001250_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	As a result of our use of the controlled company exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.
1001250_15_ITEM1B_P0_S0	As of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, there were no unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1001250_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following table sets forth our principal owned and leased manufacturing, assembly, research and development and distribution facilities as of August 14, 2015.
1001250_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	The leases expire at various times through 2029 subject to certain renewal options.
1001250_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own, lease and occupy numerous offices, assembly and distribution facilities and warehouses in the United States and abroad.
1001250_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	We consider our properties to be generally in good condition and believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet anticipated requirements.
1001250_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	We lease approximately 739,000 square feet of rentable space for our principal offices in New York, New York.
1001250_15_ITEM2_P1_S3	We own a building of approximately 57,000 square feet of office space in Melville, New York.
1001250_15_ITEM2_P1_S4	As of June 30, 2015, we directly operated approximately 1,060 retail stores.

1001250_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A Common Stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EL.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table shows the high and low per share sales prices as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014:
1001250_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	We expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future, but there can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will continue to declare them.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	On August 14, 2015, a dividend was declared in the amount of $.24 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	The dividend is payable in cash on September 15, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2015.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of August 14, 2015, there were 8,658 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 16 record holders of Class B Common Stock.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 216.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	As of June 30, 2015, the cumulative total of acquired shares pursuant to the authorization was 187.6 million, reducing the remaining authorized share repurchase balance to 28.4 million.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P3_S2	During fiscal 2015, we purchased approximately 11.7 million shares pursuant to the authorization for $927.7 million as outlined in the following table:
1001250_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	(1) The initial program covering the repurchase of 16.0 million shares was announced in September 1998 and increased by 40.0 million shares each in November 2012, November 2007, February 2007 and May 2005 and 20.0 million shares in both May 2004 and October 2002.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	(2) Includes shares that were repurchased by the Company in connection with shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of stock-based compensation.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	Subsequent to June 30, 2015 and as of August 14, 2015, we purchased approximately 2.0 million additional shares of Class A Common Stock for $175.0 million pursuant to our share repurchase program.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	Shares of Class B Common Stock may be converted immediately into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis by the holder and are automatically converted into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis upon transfer to a person or entity that is not a Permitted Transferee or soon after a record date for a meeting of stockholders where the outstanding Class B Common Stock constitutes less than 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P6_S1	There is no cash or other consideration paid by the holder converting the shares and, accordingly, there is no cash or other consideration received by the Company.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P6_S2	The shares of Class A Common Stock issued by the Company in such conversions are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) thereof.
1001250_15_ITEM5_P7_S0	During the year ended June 30, 2015, the stockholders set forth in the table below converted shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock on the dates set forth below:
1001250_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The table below summarizes selected financial information.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto beginning on page F-1 of this report.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Fiscal 2014 results included $(1.8) million, after tax, related to total adjustments associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P1_S1	Fiscal 2013 results included $11.7 million, after tax, or $.03 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P1_S2	Fiscal 2012 results included $44.1 million, after tax, or $.11 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.

1001250_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	(b) As a result of our July 2014 SMI rollout, approximately $178 million of accelerated orders were recorded as net sales and $127 million as operating income in fiscal 2014 that would have occurred in the fiscal 2015 first quarter, equal to approximately $.21 per diluted common share.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P3_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a $5.3 million charge, on a before and after tax basis, related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, equal to $.01 per diluted common share.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P3_S1	During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a $38.3 million charge, on a before and after tax basis, related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, equal to $.10 per diluted common share.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P4_S0	(d) In September 2012, we redeemed the $230.1 million principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due November 1, 2013 ( 2013 Senior Notes ) at a price of 108% of the principal amount.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P4_S1	We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million ($12.2 million after tax, or $.03 per diluted share) representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P5_S0	In December 2012, we amended the agreement related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields (a brand then owned by us) to receive a fixed amount in lieu of future contingent consideration and other rights.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P5_S1	As a result of the original and amended terms of the agreement, we recognized $23.1 million as other income in our consolidated statement of earnings.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P5_S2	In November 2011, we settled a commercial dispute with third parties that was outside our normal operations.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P5_S3	In connection therewith, we received a $10.5 million cash payment, which has been classified as other income in our consolidated statement of earnings.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P6_S0	(f) In August 2012, we issued $250.0 million of 2.35% Senior Notes due August 15, 2022 and $250.0 million of 3.70% Senior Notes due August 15, 2042 in a public offering.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P6_S1	We used the net proceeds of the offering to redeem the 2013 Senior Notes and for general corporate purposes.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P7_S0	In June 2015, we issued $300.0 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due June 15, 2045 in a public offering.
1001250_15_ITEM6_P7_S1	We are using the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2015 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1001250_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company s financial condition.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at our retail stores.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested and approved.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	In accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.4% in fiscal 2015 and 2014 and 3.3% in fiscal 2013.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	This accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	Consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	Experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P6_S5	The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Inventory We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	We believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	Inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead, as well as inbound freight.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P7_S5	Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Costs We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan ( U.S. Qualified Plan ) and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the Domestic Plans a domestic contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and future compensation levels.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	While we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	For fiscal 2015, net periodic benefit cost was determined using discount rates for our Domestic Plans of 3.60% and 4.30% and varying rates on our international plans between .50% and 6.75%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The discount rates for our Domestic Plans were based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	We used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	For our international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	For fiscal 2015, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.50% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of between 2.00% and 6.75% for our international plans.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 Pension, Deferred Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Plans for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	For fiscal 2015, our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $61 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $72 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	The resulting net deferred loss of approximately $11 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 18 years.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	The actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans was lower than expected, primarily due to underperformance of U.S. plan assets partially offset by stronger than expected returns on international plan assets.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	A 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2015 pension expense:
1001250_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2015 would have had the following effects:
1001250_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	To determine the fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit cost, we are using discount rates of 4.40% and 3.70% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and the non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan, respectively, and varying rates for our international plans of between .75% and 7.00%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	We are using an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 2.00% and 7.00%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	The net change in these two key assumptions from those used in fiscal 2015 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $11 million in fiscal 2016.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	We make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P20_S4	When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P20_S5	If necessary, the quantitative impairment test is performed in two steps: (i) we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P20_S6	When testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we also have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	For fiscal 2015, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	We considered macroeconomic factors including the global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible assets are employed, and the growth of the global prestige beauty industry.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	In addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, we considered the reporting units current results and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business climate factors, changes in the industry/competitive environment, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and our intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of a trademark.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	With regard to our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of RODIN olio lusso, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle and GLAMGLOW, the carrying values of the related goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the assessment date approximated their fair values.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P22_S5	As a result of our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired and we did not need to perform a quantitative assessment.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	For fiscal 2014, we tested our reporting units for impairment using the two-step approach and our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	As a result of these tests, we concluded the fair values of our reporting units and the fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets substantially exceeded their carrying values.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	As of June 30, 2015, we have current net deferred tax assets of $279.0 million and non-current net deferred tax assets of $72.1 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of $120.9 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P25_S4	Based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P25_S5	If our assessment of realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	For those tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	We classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Quantitative Analysis During the three-year period ended June 30, 2015, there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	The results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	For fiscal 2015, had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately $5.9 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.2 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	The collective impact of these changes on operating income, net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc., and net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately $5.9 million, $5.7 million and $.01, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Item 8.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 20 Segment Data and Related Information for all periods presented.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:
1001250_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	We calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	We believe the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with superior products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers changing behaviors and shopping preferences.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	To be the global leader in prestige beauty, we are guided by our long-term strategy through fiscal 2018, which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	We also plan to continue to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship in high quality products and services and engaging communications.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	We believe our diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas in prestige beauty.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Skin care, our most profitable product category, remains a strategic priority for us and, as a result, we continue to support our large, long-standing skin care product lines including Advanced Night Repair from Est e Lauder, Clinique s 3-Step Skin Care System and Cr me de la Mer from La Mer.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	We are also developing and introducing new products, such as New Dimension from Est e Lauder, the Clinique Sonic System Purifying Cleansing Brush and Clinique Smart custom-repair serum, as well as skin care masks from La Mer.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	We also supplemented our skin care offerings in fiscal 2015 through the recent acquisitions of GLAMGLOW and RODIN olio lusso.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	While global prestige skin care growth was slower in fiscal 2015, global growth in prestige makeup accelerated, in part due to social media activities.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	This benefited our makeup sales, and we continue to believe that the makeup category represents one of our most compelling growth opportunities.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	During the year, we successfully launched a number of new products, including new collections from our makeup artist brands, Pure Color Envy sculpting lipstick and sculpting eye shadow palette from Est e Lauder, and Pop Lip Colour and Primer, Beyond Perfecting foundation and concealer and Chubby Stick sculpting products from Clinique.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	Our fragrance category has benefited from new launches, expanded distribution from our luxury fragrance brands and our recent acquisitions of Le Labo and Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	In addition, we are expanding our hair care brands in salons and other retail channels.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P39_S5	To complement the strategies in our existing business, we are continuously looking to acquire and incubate smaller brands that we believe have growth potential and may provide unique opportunities for profitable growth in the future.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our global footprint provides us many avenues of growth, enabling us to quickly utilize our strengths to capture opportunities around the world by leveraging our regional organization and to align the talents and expertise of our people in an effort to assure that we are locally relevant with our products, services, channels, marketing and visual merchandising.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	We are seeking share growth in large, image-building cities within core markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Japan by strengthening our geographic presence there.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	In addition, we continue to expand our presence and accelerate growth in emerging markets such as China, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Brazil, Russia and South Africa.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	During fiscal 2015, we have seen a general slowdown in department store traffic in some markets, which has particularly affected Est e Lauder and Clinique, but we have been able to grow our business in other channels.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	In North America, we continued to expand our presence in specialty multi-brand retailers and freestanding retail stores.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P40_S5	Internationally, we expanded our business in freestanding stores, in European perfumeries and pharmacies, and in department stores, particularly in the United Kingdom and certain markets in Asia.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P40_S6	Travel retail remains an important source of sales growth, profitability and brand building, although it is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and consumers willingness and ability to travel.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P40_S7	We have strategies focused on consumers who purchase in this channel, in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P40_S8	In addition, we have identified opportunities to expand our online portfolio around the world, resulting in strong net sales growth in this channel, and we are in the early stages of developing and testing omnichannel concepts to better serve consumers as they shop across channels.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P40_S9	We are applying what we have learned from our digital strategy in the United States to other markets such as Brazil and Russia.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P40_S10	To further drive our online sales, we are expanding our presence on key third-party platforms in China, where we are seeing promising results.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	While our business is performing well overall, we continue to see competitive pressures and economic challenges in certain countries around the world .
1001250_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	We remain cautious of slower retail growth in Hong Kong and China, a decline in spending by Russian and Brazilian travelers, unfavorable foreign exchange due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies, and lower net sales from our travel retail business in Korea, one of our largest markets for travel retail, due to a decrease in the number of travelers there as a result of the recent outbreak of the MERS virus.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Additionally, we are monitoring the effects of economic instability in Russia, Greece and Brazil.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	We believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas where we see more strength by utilizing the various growth drivers among our brands, channels and markets.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	However, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged, then we expect there could be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence, demand and spending and, as a result, our business.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	We will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we plan to execute our strategy by focusing on the multiple growth engines that we believe will promote long-term sustainable growth.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	These include strengthening our presence in emerging markets, continuing to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands, focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	We will continue to drive innovation and creativity that we believe will enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P43_S3	Some will involve new sub-categories and others may expand key franchises.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P43_S4	We expect to leverage our topline growth through greater productivity, due in part to cost savings and efficiencies from our Strategic Modernization Initiative ( SMI ).
1001250_15_ITEM7_P43_S5	We plan to continue allocating our resources to growth drivers such as digital capabilities, including the development of omnichannel concepts, retail store expansion and information technology enhancements.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P43_S6	We also plan to continue to succeed in high growth product categories, sub-categories and channels of distribution, benefit from regional opportunities, focus on emerging market and luxury consumers and enhance our local relevance.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Investment in our global information systems is ongoing.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	We have implemented initiatives to leverage our SMI foundation that are focused on sustainment and global efficiencies.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	As we continue to modernize our key processes, related systems and infrastructure, we are also developing upgraded capabilities to support our human resource operations and are making investments to upgrade our global technology infrastructure, as well as our retail systems and retail capabilities globally.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	These initiatives are expected to improve profitability by enhancing gross margin and supporting efficiencies in select operating expenses and working capital, freeing resources to strategically reinvest in activities to support our future growth.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	We rolled out the last major wave of SMI in July 2014 and currently most of our locations are SAP-enabled.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	We plan to continue the implementation of SAP at our remaining locations throughout the next few fiscal years.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	In connection with the July 2014 implementation, some retailers accelerated their sales orders that would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the SMI rollout.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	The impact on net sales and operating results by product category and geographic region was as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	The higher orders at the end of fiscal 2014, coupled with the resulting lower orders in the beginning of fiscal 2015 created a difficult comparison between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, which resulted in a variance of approximately $357 million in net sales and approximately $254 million in operating results and adversely impacted our operating margin comparisons.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	While these additional orders had an adverse impact on our fiscal 2015 net sales and operating results comparisons, we expect there to be corresponding favorable comparisons on our first quarter and full year fiscal 2016 net sales and operating results.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	We believe the presentation of certain year-to-date comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Net sales decreased 2%, or $188.4 million, to $10,780.4 million, entirely driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $519 million and the difficult comparison due to the accelerated orders, as discussed above, of approximately $357 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	Inclusive of these items, higher net sales in our makeup and hair care product categories were more than offset by declines in our skin care and fragrance product categories, while geographically, we experienced lower net sales in each region.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	Our makeup artist and luxury brands continued to grow net sales through successful product launches and expanded global distribution.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	However, net sales from Est e Lauder and Clinique have been challenged in all of our product categories and reflect a difficult comparison to the prior year, which featured significant launch activity related to the reformulation of certain iconic skin care products and several significant fragrance launches.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P49_S4	In addition, we are experiencing strong growth in certain channels such as specialty-multi, online and freestanding stores, as well as expansion in emerging markets.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P49_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, net sales would have increased 6%, with growth in each of our major product categories and within each geographic region.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	The change in net sales in each product category was negatively impacted by the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter from certain of our retailers due to our implementation of SMI as follows: skin care, approximately $183 million; makeup, approximately $131 million; fragrance, approximately $42 million; and hair care, approximately $1 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Skin Care Net sales of skin care products decreased 6%, or $291.1 million, to $4,478.7 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	This decrease reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $215 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	The decrease, as reported, reflected lower net sales of Est e Lauder and Clinique products of approximately $303 million, combined, primarily due to the accelerated orders and significant launch activity in the prior year related to the reformulation of certain iconic products.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	These decreases were partially offset by higher sales of La Mer products, primarily due to new launches and expanded distribution in the travel retail channel, and incremental sales from our recent acquisitions of approximately $23 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P51_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, skin care net sales would have increased 2%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P51_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales decreased 2%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P51_S6	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in skin care would have decreased 2%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Makeup Makeup net sales increased 2%, or $94.4 million, to $4,304.6 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	This change reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $205 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	The net sales increase, as reported, primarily reflected higher net sales from our makeup artist brands, Tom Ford and Smashbox of approximately $293 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	Sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings, as well as expanded distribution in a number of channels, including our freestanding retail stores.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P52_S4	The higher net sales from Tom Ford and Smashbox were primarily due to expanded distribution of Tom Ford in the travel retail channel and Smashbox in specialty multi-brand retailers.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P52_S5	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of Clinique and Est e Lauder products of approximately $161 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P52_S6	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, makeup net sales would have increased 10%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P52_S7	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 7%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P52_S8	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in makeup would have increased 5%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products decreased 1%, or $8.6 million, to $1,416.4 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	This decrease was entirely driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $75 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	The decrease, as reported, primarily reflected lower sales of certain Est e Lauder, Clinique, Coach and Tommy Hilfiger fragrances of approximately $98 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	These decreases were mostly offset by the strong performance of luxury fragrances from Jo Malone London and Tom Ford that resulted in higher net sales of approximately $91 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P53_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, fragrance net sales would have increased 8%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P53_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased 5%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P53_S6	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in fragrance would have increased 2%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 3%, or $15.0 million, to $530.6 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	This change reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $22 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	The increase in net sales reflected expanded global distribution of Aveda products in department stores, freestanding retail stores, salons and in the travel retail channel, and Bumble and bumble products in specialty multi-brand retailers.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	The category also benefited from increased sales of Smooth Infusion Naturally Straight from Aveda, as well as the expansion of the Hairdresser s Invisible Oil line of products from Bumble and bumble which contributed approximately $12 million to the increase, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P54_S4	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of the Invati line of products and Dry Remedy shampoo from Aveda of approximately $6 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P54_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, hair care net sales would have increased 7%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P54_S6	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 7%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P54_S7	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in hair care would have increased 3%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	The overall change in net sales in each geographic region was negatively impacted by the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter from certain of our retailers due to our implementation of SMI as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	Americas, approximately $169 million; Europe, the Middle East Africa, approximately $136 million; and Asia/Pacific, approximately $52 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Net sales in the Americas decreased 1%, or $58.5 million, to $4,513.8 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Net sales in the United States and Canada, as reported, decreased approximately $53 million, combined, primarily due to lower net sales from certain of our heritage brands, driven by the impact of the accelerated orders and a difficult comparison with the prior year, which featured significant launch activity related to the reformulation of certain iconic products.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales from our makeup artist, luxury and hair care brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	Net sales in Latin America decreased approximately $5 million, primarily reflecting lower net sales in Venezuela, partially offset by higher net sales in Brazil.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P56_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, net sales in the Americas would have increased 6%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P56_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in the Americas increased 2%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P56_S6	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in the Americas would have increased 2%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, net sales decreased 2%, or $77.3 million, to $4,086.4 million, driven by approximately $285 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies in the region.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Lower sales in our travel retail business, Germany, Iberia and Italy totaled approximately $185 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	The lower sales in our travel retail business were driven by the impact of the accelerated orders.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	Excluding this impact, travel retail net sales increased due to a strategic expansion of certain of our luxury brands and our makeup artist brands, partially offset by the negative impact of the social instability in Hong Kong, as well as changes in the purchasing power of key groups of travelers.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S4	The decrease in sales in Germany, Iberia and Italy was due to the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S5	Excluding this impact, net sales in Germany, Iberia and Italy increased, primarily driven by certain of our luxury, makeup artist and hair care brands as a result of expanded distribution and new product introductions.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S6	Partially offsetting these reported decreases were higher sales in the United Kingdom and the Middle East of approximately $122 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S7	The increase in sales in the United Kingdom was primarily driven by our makeup artist and luxury brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S8	Higher sales in the Middle East were primarily driven by certain of our luxury brands and makeup artist brands as a result of new product introductions and expanded distribution.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S9	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, net sales in Europe, the Middle East Africa would have increased 8%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S10	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Europe, the Middle East Africa net sales increased 5%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P57_S11	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in Europe, the Middle East Africa would have increased 1%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Net sales in Asia/Pacific decreased 2%, or $52.5 million, to $2,180.2 million, driven by approximately $79 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to certain currencies in the region.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Lower sales in Japan and Hong Kong totaled approximately $94 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	The decrease in net sales in Japan primarily reflected the impact of the accelerated orders and foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher sales of certain of our luxury and makeup artist brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P58_S3	The lower sales in Hong Kong were primarily due to the negative impact to our business as a result of the social instability there.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P58_S4	These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales in China, Australia and Korea of approximately $46 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P58_S5	The higher net sales in China were primarily driven by certain of our heritage and luxury brands, and our makeup artist brands as a result of expanded distribution in department stores, freestanding stores and online.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P58_S6	For Australia and Korea, the higher net sales were from certain of our makeup artist and luxury brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P58_S7	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, net sales in Asia/Pacific would have increased 4%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P58_S8	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 1%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P58_S9	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in Asia/Pacific would have been flat.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 19.5% as compared with 19.7% in the prior year.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	This improvement reflected favorable changes in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 20 basis points, partially offset by an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales, and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	In addition, future cost of sales may be impacted by channels of distribution and their relative growth.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 65.6% as compared with 63.6% in the prior year, and were impacted by the accelerated orders and brand and channel mix as certain retail and media formats carry different cost structures.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	As a percentage of net sales, this increase primarily reflected an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately 100 basis points as a result of higher support spending behind capability-building initiatives, such as information technology, as well as for acquisition-related expenses.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	This increase also reflected higher store operating and selling costs of approximately 110 basis points, combined, primarily driven by the expansion of M A C and Jo Malone London freestanding retail stores.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	Also contributing to this increase were higher costs associated with stock-based compensation and higher spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling as a percentage of net sales of approximately 10 basis points, each.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P62_S4	Partially offsetting these increases were lower charges related to the measurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela of approximately 30 basis points and favorable changes in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P62_S5	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales would have increased approximately 10 basis points, primarily reflecting an increase in general and administrative expenses and higher store operating costs, partially offset by lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling and lower charges related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets and brands being emphasized.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Operating income decreased 12%, or $221.3 million, to $1,606.3 million, driven entirely by the negative impact of the accelerated orders of approximately $254 million and foreign currency translation of approximately $131 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Operating margin decreased to 14.9% of net sales as compared with 16.7% in the prior year, reflecting an increase in our operating expense margin, partially offset by our higher gross margin.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income would have increased 2% and operating margin would have remained flat.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our skin care, makeup and fragrance results declined, primarily reflecting the accelerated orders, as well as certain challenges and difficult comparisons affecting our net sales growth in certain markets and channels by our heritage brands as previously discussed.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	These decreases were partially offset by improved results from our makeup artist, certain luxury, and our hair care brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	While certain operating expenses have increased as a percentage of net sales during the current year, we have been able to implement cost containment measures to mitigate the impact.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	The overall change in operating results in each product category was negatively impacted by the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter from certain of our retailers due to our implementation of SMI as follows: skin care, approximately $144 million; makeup, approximately $82 million; fragrance, approximately $28 million; and the impact on hair care was de minimis.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Skin care operating income decreased 15%, or $143.6 million, to $832.2 million, reflecting the impact of the accelerated orders and a difficult comparison to the significant launch activity in the prior year by certain of our heritage brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	Makeup operating income decreased 8%, or $56.6 million, to $659.3 million, primarily due to lower results from our heritage brands, reflecting the impact of the accelerated orders, partially offset by improved results from our makeup artist brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	Fragrance operating income decreased 20%, or $21.3 million, to $82.8 million, reflecting the lower launch activity from certain designer fragrances and heritage brands, partially offset by higher results from certain of our luxury fragrance brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	Hair care operating results increased 12%, or $4.2 million, to $37.9 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales driven by expanded global distribution and new product launches, as well as lower investment spending as compared with the higher level of spending in the prior year to support the Invati line of products.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P67_S4	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, skin care operating results would have been flat and makeup, fragrance and hair care operating results would have increased 4%, 7% and 13%, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	The overall change in operating results in each geographic region was negatively impacted by the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter from certain of our retailers due to our implementation of SMI as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	Americas, approximately $106 million; Europe, the Middle East Africa, approximately $106 million; and Asia/Pacific, approximately $42 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Operating income in the Americas decreased 44%, or $235.0 million, to $302.3 million, primarily reflecting the decrease in net sales from our heritage brands in the United States and Canada associated with the accelerated orders and the significant launch activity in the prior year related to the reformulation of certain iconic products, as well as higher general and administrative expenses, which include acquisition-related expenses.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	This decrease was partially offset by lower advertising, merchandising and sampling spending by our heritage brands due to the lower launch activity and a reallocation of spending among media formats.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	The region also benefited from higher results in Latin America, primarily driven by lower charges related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P69_S3	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in the Americas would have decreased 27%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, operating income increased less than 1%, or $5.0 million, to $943.3 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	Higher operating results in the United Kingdom, the Middle East, France, India, Russia and Switzerland of approximately $83 million, combined, were partially offset by lower operating results in our travel retail business, due to the accelerated orders, and, to a lesser extent, Germany of approximately $79 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	The higher results in France, India, Russia and Switzerland were primarily due to an increase in constant currency net sales.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in Europe, the Middle East Africa would have increased 13%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 3%, or $11.6 million, to $360.7 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	Higher results in China, Korea and Australia totaled approximately $49 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	These higher results were partially offset by lower results in Japan, due to the accelerated orders, and Singapore of approximately $40 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	The lower results in Singapore were primarily due to lower net sales.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P71_S4	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in Asia/Pacific would have increased 16%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Interest expense increased to $60.0 million as compared with $59.4 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher short- and long- term debt levels.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Interest income and investment income, net increased to $14.3 million as compared with $8.6 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher investment income as a result of an increase in short- and long-term investment balances and rates in connection with our modified cash investment strategy, as well as realized gains on investments.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	See Financial Condition below for further discussion of our modified cash investment strategy.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	The effective rate for income taxes was 29.9% and 32.0% for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	The decrease of 210 basis points was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations, which included Venezuela remeasurement charges in fiscal 2015 and 2014 of $5.3 million and $38.3 million, respectively, for which no tax benefit was provided.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	This reduction was partially offset by an increase in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in the current year.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. as compared with the prior year decreased 10%, or $115.2 million, to $1,088.9 million and diluted net earnings per common share decreased 8% from $3.06 to $2.82.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	Management believes that excluding these items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	The following tables present Net Sales, Operating Income and Diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of accelerated orders associated with the July 2014 SMI rollout, adjustments associated with restructuring activities and the Venezuela remeasurement charges.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	The tables provide reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The following table reconciles the change in net sales by product category and geographic region, as reported, to the change in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders:
1001250_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Net sales increased 8%, or $787.1 million, to $10,968.8 million, primarily reflecting growth in all of our product categories and geographic regions.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	The impact of foreign currency translation on the change in net sales was de minimis.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	In advance of our July 2014 implementation of SMI at certain of our locations and to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the rollout, certain of our retailers accelerated their orders during the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	Those additional orders, which totaled approximately $178 million, would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter and created a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales would have increased 6%, with growth in all of our product categories and geographic regions.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	The change in net sales in each product category benefited from the accelerated orders during fiscal 2014, as discussed above, as follows: skin care, approximately $91 million; makeup, approximately $65 million; fragrance, approximately $21 million; and hair care, approximately $1 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Skin Care Net sales of skin care products increased 7%, or $304.5 million, to $4,769.8 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	The fiscal 2014 launches of Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II and Micro Essence Skin Activating Treatment Lotion from Est e Lauder, and Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion + and reformulated Repairwear Laser Focus from Clinique contributed approximately $615 million of incremental sales, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	Also contributing to the increase were higher sales of La Mer products and the Nutritious line of products from Est e Lauder of approximately $144 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P85_S3	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of certain existing Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery products from Est e Lauder and Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion and Repairwear Laser Focus from Clinique of approximately $493 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P85_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 8%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P85_S5	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in skin care would have increased 5%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Makeup Makeup net sales increased 9%, or $333.3 million, to $4,210.2 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales from our makeup artist brands, the fiscal 2014 launch of All About Shadow from Clinique and higher sales of Smashbox products of approximately $339 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	Sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings, as well as expanded distribution in line with our retail store strategy.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of Chubby Stick Moisturizing Lip Colour Balm and High Impact Lip Color from Clinique, as well as the fiscal 2013 launches of Pore Refining Solutions Makeup from Clinique and Pure Color Vivid Shine Lipstick from Est e Lauder of approximately $34 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P86_S3	The impact of foreign currency translation on makeup net sales was de minimis.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P86_S4	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in makeup would have increased 7%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Fragrance Net sales of fragrance products increased 9%, or $114.2 million, to $1,425.0 million, primarily reflecting the fiscal 2014 launches of Est e Lauder Modern Muse, the Michael Kors Collection, Jo Malone Peony Blush Suede and Tory Burch, as well as higher sales of Tom Ford Black Orchid of approximately $149 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Est e Lauder pleasures , Donna Karan Cashmere Mist, DKNY Be Delicious So Intense and Coach Poppy of approximately $31 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	The impact of foreign currency translation on fragrance net sales was de minimis.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in fragrance would have increased 7%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Hair Care Hair care net sales increased 5%, or $26.7 million, to $515.6 million, reflecting the continued success and growth of the Invati line of products and the new and reformulated Dry Remedy line of products from Aveda, which contributed approximately $25 million, combined to the increase.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	The category benefited from sales generated from expanded global distribution of Aveda products to salons and in the travel retail channel and Bumble and bumble products to specialty multi-brand retailers.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of Ojon products.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P89_S3	The decrease in Ojon net sales was primarily due to the exit of that business from the direct response television channel in our fiscal 2014 second quarter.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P89_S4	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 6%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P89_S5	The impact of the accelerated orders on the change in reported net sales in hair care was de minimis.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	The overall change in net sales in each geographic region benefited from the accelerated orders during fiscal 2014, as discussed above, as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	Americas, approximately $84 million; Europe, the Middle East Africa, approximately $68 million; and Asia/Pacific, approximately $26 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Net sales in the Americas increased 6%, or $269.4 million, to $4,572.3 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales in the United States of approximately $231 million, including the $84 million in accelerated orders.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	This growth primarily reflected new collections from our makeup artist brands, higher sales of prestige products from our luxury brands, the continued expansion of Smashbox at specialty multi-brand retailers and department stores, contributions from new product innovations from certain of our heritage brands, fiscal 2014 launches from certain of our designer fragrances and expansion into new retail channels by certain of our hair care brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	Net sales in Latin America increased approximately $24 million, led by Venezuela and Brazil.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	The net sales increase in Venezuela was primarily due to price increases as a result of rising inflation.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P91_S4	Net sales in Canada increased approximately $15 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P91_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, the Americas net sales increased 7%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P91_S6	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in the Americas would have increased 4%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, net sales increased 11%, or $405.0 million, to $4,163.7 million, primarily reflecting higher sales from our travel retail business, the United Kingdom, Germany and France of approximately $335 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	The net sales increase in our travel retail business primarily reflected the success of fiscal 2014 launch initiatives, an increase in global airline passenger traffic and expanded distribution, as well as the impact of the accelerated orders.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	This was despite a slowdown at retail, in part, due to an adverse impact of Chinese government actions on the travel and spending of Chinese consumers.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P92_S3	Higher sales in the United Kingdom and France were primarily driven by certain of our makeup artist and luxury brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P92_S4	The net sales increase in Germany was primarily driven by our makeup artist and certain of our heritage brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P92_S5	These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in South Africa and India of approximately $7 million, combined, driven by the weakening of their respective currencies.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P92_S6	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Europe, the Middle East Africa net sales increased 9%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P92_S7	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in Europe, the Middle East Africa would have increased 9%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Net sales in Asia/Pacific increased 5%, or $111.1 million, to $2,232.7 million, primarily reflecting higher sales in China and Hong Kong of approximately $119 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	Higher sales in China were primarily driven by expanded distribution.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P93_S2	The net sales increase in Hong Kong was primarily due to higher net sales from certain of our heritage and luxury brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P93_S3	These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in Japan and Australia of approximately $17 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P93_S4	The declines in Japan and Australia were driven by the weakening of their respective currencies, which more than offset an improvement in their local retail environments and the impact of the accelerated orders in Japan.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P93_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Asia/Pacific net sales increased 9%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P93_S6	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in Asia/Pacific would have increased 4%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	We strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 19.7% as compared with 19.9% in fiscal 2013.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	Cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales reflected strategic changes in pricing and the mix of our business of approximately 30 basis points and favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P95_S2	Partially offsetting these changes were an increase in obsolescence charges and the unfavorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points, each.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 63.6% as compared with 65.1% in fiscal 2013.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	As a percentage of net sales, this decrease primarily reflected lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling of approximately 110 basis points, lower selling costs of approximately 50 basis points and a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013, which reflected restructuring, goodwill and other impairment charges of approximately 40 basis points, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P96_S2	These improvements were partially offset by a charge in fiscal 2014 to remeasure net monetary assets in Venezuela of approximately 30 basis points and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P96_S3	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders in fiscal 2014, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales would have decreased 50 basis points, primarily reflecting lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling, and lower selling costs.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	Changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets and brands being emphasized.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	Operating income increased 20%, or $301.6 million, to $1,827.6 million and operating margin increased to 16.7% of net sales as compared with 15.0% in fiscal 2013, which primarily reflected our lower operating expense margin and, to a lesser extent, our higher gross margin.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	The overall operating results were also impacted by approximately $127 million related to the accelerated orders in fiscal 2014, as discussed above, which created a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013, partially offset by the fiscal 2014 remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela of $38.3 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	The following discussions of Operating Results by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of total charges (adjustments) associated with restructuring activities of $(2.9) million, or less than 1% of net sales, for fiscal 2014 and $17.8 million, or less than 1% of net sales, for fiscal 2013.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	We believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders in fiscal 2014 and charges (adjustments) associated with restructuring activities, operating income would have increased 10% and operating margin would have increased 50 basis points.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	The overall change in operating results in each product category benefited from the accelerated orders during fiscal 2014, as discussed above, as follows: skin care, approximately $72 million; makeup, approximately $41 million; fragrance, approximately $14 million; and the impact on hair care was de minimis.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	Skin care operating income increased 18%, or $145.7 million, to $975.8 million, primarily reflecting higher results driven by fiscal 2014 product launches from Est e Lauder and Clinique and higher sales of luxury skin care products.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	Makeup operating income increased 23%, or $135.5 million, to $715.9 million, primarily reflecting improved results from our makeup artist brands and certain of our heritage brands, attributable to growth in net sales.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	We reallocated our investment spending among brands and media formats which positively impacted operating income in the skin care and makeup product categories.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P101_S3	Fragrance operating income decreased 13%, or $16.2 million, to $104.1 million, primarily reflecting higher investment spending behind fiscal 2014 major launches, partially offset by higher results from our luxury brands.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P101_S4	The fiscal 2014 remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela impacted the skin care, makeup and fragrance product categories by $12 million, $16 million and $10 million, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P101_S5	Hair care operating results increased 26%, or $7.0 million, to $33.7 million, primarily reflecting higher results from Aveda and strategic reductions in spending behind Ojon products.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P101_S6	Adjusting for the accelerated orders, operating income in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care product categories would have increased (decreased) 9%, 16%, (25%) and 26%, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	The overall change in operating results in each geographic region benefited as a result of the accelerated orders during fiscal 2014, as discussed above, as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	Americas, approximately $53 million; Europe, the Middle East Africa, approximately $53 million; and Asia/Pacific, approximately $21 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	Operating income in the Americas increased 27%, or $114.1 million, to $537.3 million, primarily reflecting the increase in net sales, as previously discussed, as well as a more measured approach to spending.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	These improvements were partially offset by the fiscal 2014 remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P103_S2	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in the Americas would have increased 14%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, operating income increased 15%, or $124.9 million, to $938.3 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	Higher results from our travel retail business and in the United Kingdom totaled approximately $126 million, combined, primarily reflecting higher sales.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	The higher results in our travel retail business also reflected the impact of the accelerated orders.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P104_S3	These improvements were partially offset by lower operating results in France and the Middle East of approximately $10 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P104_S4	The lower results in France were due to higher spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P104_S5	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in Europe, the Middle East Africa would have increased 9%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 14%, or $41.9 million, to $349.1 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P105_S1	Higher results in Korea, Japan and Hong Kong totaled approximately $45 million, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P105_S2	The higher results in Korea were due to lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling and the higher results in Japan primarily reflected the impact of the accelerated orders.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P105_S3	The higher results in the region were partially offset by lower operating results of approximately $11 million in China and Thailand, combined.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P105_S4	The lower results from China were primarily driven by an increase in investment spending as a result of new product introductions and increased distribution.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P105_S5	Adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in Asia/Pacific would have increased 7%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	Interest expense decreased to $59.4 million as compared with $63.1 million in fiscal 2013, primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower rates in fiscal 2013.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we redeemed the $230.1 million principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2013 at a price of 108% of the principal amount.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	Interest income and investment income, net increased to $8.6 million, which remained relatively unchanged compared with $8.3 million in fiscal 2013.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	We recognized $23.1 million as other income during fiscal 2013, primarily reflecting the amended agreement related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields (a brand then owned by us).
1001250_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P110_S2	Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P110_S3	In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the period of change.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	The effective rate for income taxes was 32.0% and 30.6% for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P111_S1	The increase in the rate of 140 basis points was principally attributable to a higher effective tax rate related to the Company s foreign operations, which included the impact of the Venezuela remeasurement charge for which no tax benefit has been provided, as well as slightly higher favorable income tax reserve adjustments recorded in fiscal 2013.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. as compared with fiscal 2013 increased 18%, or $184.3 million, to $1,204.1 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased 19% from $2.58 to $3.06.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P114_S1	Management believes that excluding these items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P115_S1	The following tables present Net Sales, Operating Income and Diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of accelerated orders associated with the July 2014 SMI rollout, the Venezuela fiscal 2014 remeasurement charge, returns and charges (adjustments) associated with restructuring activities and the fiscal 2013 interest expense on debt extinguishment.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P115_S2	The tables provide reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	At June 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,021.4 million compared with $1,629.1 million at June 30, 2014.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P116_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P116_S3	To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	The decline in cash balances reflects the change in our cash investment strategy that we implemented in the fiscal 2015 second quarter, to invest a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in short- and long-term investments.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P117_S2	These investments are classified as available-for-sale and totaled $917.8 million at June 30, 2015.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	During fiscal 2015, we acquired RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand, Le Labo, a fragrance brand, Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a skin care brand.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P118_S1	The purchase price related to each of these acquisitions includes cash paid at closing plus additional amounts to be paid in the future, a portion of which is contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P118_S2	The amounts paid at closing, amounting to $237.2 million, were funded by cash on hand and through the issuance of commercial paper.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P118_S3	The additional amounts are expected to be paid from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020 with the exception of working capital adjustments that were paid during fiscal 2015 and additional working capital adjustments and a purchase price true-up payment that are expected to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P118_S4	The aggregate acquisition-date fair value of these transactions was approximately $437 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P119_S1	From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P119_S2	To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P120_S1	Our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances at June 30, 2015 include approximately $1,694 million of cash and short- and long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P120_S2	We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P120_S3	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P121_S1	Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P122_S1	Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P122_S2	Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P123_S1	As of August 14, 2015, our commercial paper is rated A-1 by Standard Poor s and P-1 by Moody s and our long-term debt is rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard Poor s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody s.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	At June 30, 2015, our outstanding borrowings were as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	(1) Consists of $300.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $6.0 million (2) Consists of $250.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $1.0 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P125_S1	(3) Consists of $300.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $3.4 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P125_S2	(4) Consists of $200.0 million principal and unamortized debt discount of $2.1 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P125_S3	(5) Consists of $250.0 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $0.2 million and a $(0.2) million adjustment to reflect the fair value of interest rate swaps.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P125_S4	(6) Consists of $300.0 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $0.1 million and a $14.0 million adjustment to reflect the termination value of interest rate swaps.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P125_S5	(7) The Senior Notes contain certain customary incurrence based covenants, including limitations on indebtedness secured by liens.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	In June 2015, we issued the 2045 Senior Notes in a public offering, priced at 97.999% with a yield of 4.497%.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P126_S1	Interest payments are required to be made semi-annually on June 15 th and December 15 th .
1001250_15_ITEM7_P126_S2	For further information, see Item 8.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 Debt .
1001250_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	We have a $1.0 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the United States.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P128_S1	As of June 30, 2015, we had no commercial paper outstanding.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P128_S2	At August 14, 2015, we had $220.0 million of commercial paper outstanding, which we may refinance on a periodic basis as it matures at then-prevailing market interest rates.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	We have a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility ) that we extended by one year and is currently set to expire on July 15, 2020.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P129_S1	We have a remaining option to extend the Facility one more year.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P129_S2	At June 30, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	The Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	Up to the equivalent of $350 million of the Facility is available for multi-currency loans.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P130_S2	The interest rate on borrowings under the Facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or % plus the Federal funds rate.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P130_S3	We incurred costs of approximately $1.0 million to establish the Facility, which costs are being amortized over the term of the Facility.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P130_S4	The Facility has an annual fee of $0.6 million, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P130_S5	The Facility also contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $150.0 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under the Facility.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) increased to 31% at June 30, 2015 from 26% at June 30, 2014, primarily due to the issuance of the 2045 Senior Notes.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,943.3 million, $1,535.2 million and $1,226.3 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P132_S1	The fiscal 2015 increase in cash flows provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected a favorable change in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and improved collections, a favorable change in inventory, reflecting our initiative to better align supply levels with forecasted demand and other supply chain improvements, and a favorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P132_S2	The accelerated orders in connection with our July 2014 SMI implementation also contributed to the favorable changes in these working capital components and the decrease in net earnings as compared to fiscal 2014.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, an increase in accrued income taxes as a result of the level and timing of tax payments, and an increase in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P133_S1	These changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, which primarily reflected accelerated orders in connection with our July 2014 SMI implementation.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	Net cash used for investing activities was $1,616.2 million, $511.6 million and $465.5 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P134_S1	The fiscal 2015 increase as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected purchases of investments in connection with the implementation of our cash investment strategy, as previously discussed.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P134_S2	Also contributing to the increase was cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of RODIN olio lusso, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle and GLAMGLOW.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	Partially offsetting cash used for investing activities were proceeds from the disposition of investments and, to a lesser extent, lower capital expenditure activity.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P135_S1	The increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 primarily reflected higher capital expenditure activity related to leasehold improvements and counters.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	Net cash used for financing activities was $894.8 million, $856.9 million and $611.5 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P136_S1	The fiscal 2015 increase in cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases and higher dividend payments, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2045 Senior Notes.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P136_S2	The increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases which were partially offset by lower dividend payments that resulted from the transition to quarterly dividends in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and the final annual dividend payment made that year.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P136_S3	In addition, fiscal 2013 reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Senior Notes and 2042 Senior Notes, which was partially offset by the redemption of the 2013 Senior Notes and repayment of commercial paper.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	For a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during the year ended June 30, 2015, see Item 8.

1001250_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	Several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P139_S1	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P139_S2	For any future contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ( ERISA ) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P140_S0	For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P140_S1	In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in Item 7.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P141_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P141_S1	The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P142_S0	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P142_S1	This strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P142_S2	During fiscal 2015, we made a cash contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan of $25.0 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P142_S3	For fiscal 2015 and 2014, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under ERISA regulations for the U.S. Qualified Plan.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P142_S4	As we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the United States during fiscal 2016.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P143_S0	For fiscal 2015 and 2014, we made benefit payments under our non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of $4.9 million and $7.2 million, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P143_S1	We expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2016 of approximately $15 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P143_S2	For fiscal 2015 and 2014, we made benefit payments under our post-retirement plans of $6.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P143_S3	We expect to make benefit payments under these plans during fiscal 2016 of approximately $6 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P143_S4	For fiscal 2015 and 2014, we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of $22.8 million and $27.9 million, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P143_S5	We expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2016 of approximately $23 million.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P144_S0	Certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or earn-out provisions.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P144_S1	These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P144_S2	Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.

1001250_15_ITEM7_P155_S0	We use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P155_S1	Value-at-risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P155_S2	We estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250-day period.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P155_S3	The high, low and average measured value-at-risk during fiscal 2015 and 2014 related to our derivative financial instruments is as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM7_P156_S0	The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P157_S0	We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P157_S1	Our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P157_S2	It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P157_S3	We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
1001250_15_ITEM7_P158_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	Under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P24_S1	Based on this assessment, the Company s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2015, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company ).
1001250_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, and income taxes.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P54_S2	Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange for the period.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P55_S1	Unrealized translation gains (losses) reported as cumulative translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. amounted to $(322.5) million, $95.1 million and $(25.6) million, net of tax, in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	For the Company s Venezuelan subsidiary operating in a highly inflationary economy, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	Remeasurement adjustments in financial statements in a highly inflationary economy and other transactional gains and losses are reflected in earnings.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted changes to the foreign exchange controls that expanded the use of its then-existing exchange mechanisms and created another exchange control mechanism ( SICAD II ), which allowed companies to apply for the purchase of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated securities for any legal use or purpose.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	The Company considered its specific facts and circumstances in determining the appropriate remeasurment rate and determined the SICAD II rate was the most appropriate rate that reflected the economics of its Venezuelan subsidiary s business as of March 24, 2014, when the SICAD II mechanism became operational.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P58_S2	As a result, the Company changed the exchange rate used to remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan subsidiary from 6.3 to the SICAD II rate, which was 49.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P58_S3	98 as of June 30, 2014.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P58_S4	Accordingly, a remeasurement charge of $38.3 million, on a before and after tax basis, was reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2014.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	On February 12, 2015, the Venezuelan government introduced a new open market foreign exchange system ( SIMADI ), which effectively replaced the SICAD II mechanism.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	As the SIMADI is the only mechanism legally available at this time for the Company s highest priority transactions, which are the import of goods, the Company changed the exchange rate used to remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan subsidiary to the SIMADI rate during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P59_S2	Accordingly, a remeasurement charge of $5.3 million, on a before and after tax basis, was reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2015.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P59_S3	The net monetary assets of the Company s Venezuelan subsidiary were not material as of June 30, 2015.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	Accordingly, the Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange (gains) losses on foreign currency transactions, including the effect of the Venezuela remeasurement charges, of $(4.1) million, $46.7 million and $3.5 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include $373.4 million and $971.9 million of short-term time deposits at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	During the fiscal 2015 second quarter, the Company modified its cash investment strategy to invest a portion of its cash and cash equivalents in short- and long-term investments.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Company s investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in the Company s investment policy.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P64_S2	These investments are classified as available-for-sale, with any temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an investment presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ).
1001250_15_ITEM15_P64_S3	See Note 12 Fair Value Measurements for further information about how the fair values of investments are determined.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	Investments in privately-held companies in which the Company has significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P65_S1	These investments were not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 and are included in Long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss positions for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P66_S1	Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P66_S2	Factors considered by the Company include, but are not limited to (i) the length of time and extent the security has been in a material loss position; (ii) the financial condition and creditworthiness of the issuer; (iii) future economic conditions and market forecasts related to the issuer s industry, sector, or geography; (iv) the Company s intent and ability to retain its investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value; and (v) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of market value.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	Accounts receivable is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions totaling $20.6 million and $23.9 million as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P67_S1	This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	Inventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	Cost components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as inbound freight.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P68_S2	Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P68_S3	Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company s customers.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	Included in inventory and promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P69_S2	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P69_S3	In addition, and as necessary, specific reserves for future known or anticipated events may be established.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ( fair-value hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash-flow hedge), or (iii) not designated as a hedging instrument.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P71_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge that is highly effective are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments).
1001250_15_ITEM15_P71_S3	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash-flow hedge of a forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in OCI.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P71_S4	Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).
1001250_15_ITEM15_P71_S5	Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P78_S1	The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company s operating segments.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P78_S2	The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P78_S3	The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P78_S4	When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P78_S5	If necessary, the quantitative impairment test is performed in two steps: (i) the Company determines if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P78_S6	When testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company also has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge is recorded.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	For fiscal 2015, the Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P80_S1	This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying value.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P80_S2	The Company considered macroeconomic factors including the global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible assets are employed, and the growth of the global prestige beauty industry.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P80_S3	In addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, the Company considered the reporting units current results and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business climate factors, changes in the industry/competitive environment, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and its intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of a trademark.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	For fiscal 2014, the Company tested its reporting units for impairment using the two-step approach and its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P83_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P83_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	The Company s sales that are subject to credit risk are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries, specialty multi-brand retailers and retailers in its travel retail business.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P84_S2	The Company grants credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company s largest customer sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for $1,060.4 million, or 10%, $1,142.7 million, or 10%, and $1,078.8 million, or 11%, of the Company s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	This customer accounted for $139.1 million, or 12%, and $158.5 million, or 11%, of the Company s accounts receivable at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P86_S1	In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P86_S2	In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at the Company s retail stores.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company records revenues generated from purchase with purchase promotions in Net Sales and costs of its purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions in Cost of Sales.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	The Company s practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested and approved.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P88_S2	In accepting returns, the Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P88_S3	As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.4% in fiscal 2015 and 2014 and 3.3% in fiscal 2013.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	Certain incentive arrangements require the payment of a fee to customers based on their attainment of pre-established sales levels.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	These fees have been accrued and recorded as a reduction of Net Sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were not material to the results of operations in any period presented.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company enters into transactions related to demonstration, advertising and counter construction, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P90_S1	These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P90_S2	To the extent the Company receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for consideration and the fair-value of the benefit can be reasonably estimated, the Company s share of the cost of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were approximately $1,378 million, $1,410 million and $1,412 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development were $2,771.5 million, $2,840.0 million and $2,754.8 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are expensed as incurred.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	Excluding the impact of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions, costs for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings were $2,558.6 million, $2,618.1 million and $2,541.0 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	Research and development costs of $178.1 million, $157.9 million and $146.8 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and are expensed as incurred.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P95_S1	The Company considers lease renewals when such renewals are reasonably assured.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding from its lessors.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as a reduction of rent expense.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company s license agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors trademarks.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P97_S1	The licenses typically have an initial term of approximately 5 years to 11 years, and are renewable subject to the Company s compliance with the license agreement provisions.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P97_S2	The remaining terms, including the potential renewal periods, range from approximately 5 years to 26 years.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	Most of the Company s licenses were entered into to create new business.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P99_S1	In some cases, the Company acquired, or entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a pre-existing beauty products business.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P99_S2	In those cases, other intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P100_S1	Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P101_S1	Upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock units, performance share units, performance share units based on total stockholder return and market share units, the resulting excess tax benefits, if any, are credited to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P101_S2	Any resulting tax deficiencies will first be offset against those cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P101_S3	If the cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital are exhausted, tax deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P102_S1	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P102_S2	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P102_S3	Based on the Company s assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required during the current year.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P102_S4	If the Company s assessment of realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P103_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P103_S2	The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P103_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P103_S4	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P104_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P104_S2	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance that requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P106_S1	If either (i) an NOL carryforward, a similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward is not available as of the reporting date under the governing tax law to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position or (ii) the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose (provided that the tax law permits a choice), an entity should present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P106_S2	This guidance became effective for unrecognized tax benefits that existed as of the Company s fiscal 2015 first quarter.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P106_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to resolve the diversity in practice concerning the release of the cumulative translation adjustment ( CTA ) into net income (i) when a parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity, and (ii) in connection with a step acquisition of a foreign entity.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	This amended guidance requires that CTA be released in net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided, and that a pro rata portion of the CTA be released into net income upon a partial sale of an equity method investment in a foreign entity only.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P107_S2	In addition, the amended guidance clarifies the definition of a sale of an investment in a foreign entity to include both, events that result in the loss of a controlling financial interest in a foreign entity and events that result in an acquirer obtaining control of an acquiree in which it held an equity interest immediately prior to the date of acquisition.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P107_S3	The CTA should be released into net income upon the occurrence of such events.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P107_S4	This guidance became effective prospectively for the Company s fiscal 2015 first quarter.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P107_S5	The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines how companies should report revenues from contracts with customers.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P108_S1	The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P108_S2	It provides companies with a single comprehensive five-step principles-based model to use in accounting for revenue and supersedes current revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific and transaction-specific revenue guidance.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P108_S3	In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P108_S4	As a result, the new standard would not be effective for the Company until fiscal 2019.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P108_S5	In addition, the FASB is allowing companies to early adopt this guidance for the Company s fiscal 2018.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P108_S6	The guidance permits an entity to apply the standard retrospectively to all prior periods presented, with certain practical expedients, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P108_S7	The Company will apply this new guidance when it becomes effective and has not yet selected a transition method.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	No other recently issued accounting pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P120_S2	The purchase price related to each of these acquisitions includes cash paid at closing plus additional amounts to be paid in the future, a portion of which is contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P120_S3	The amounts paid at closing were funded by cash on hand and through the issuance of commercial paper.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P120_S4	The additional amounts are expected to be paid from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020 with the exception of working capital adjustments that were paid during fiscal 2015 and additional working capital adjustments and a purchase price true-up payment that are expected to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P120_S5	The aggregate acquisition-date fair value of these transactions was approximately $437 million.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	These fiscal 2015 acquisitions were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P121_S1	Pro forma results of operations of the prior year have not been presented, as the impact on the Company s consolidated financial results would not have been material.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	During the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company acquired RODIN olio lusso, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle and GLAMGLOW, which included the addition of goodwill of $246.9 million, amortizable intangible assets of $28.0 million (with a weighted-average amortization period of approximately 9 years) and non-amortizable intangible assets of $154.8 million related to the Company s fragrance and skin care product categories.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	Other intangible assets include trademarks and patents, as well as license agreements and other intangible assets resulting from or related to businesses and assets purchased by the Company.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P125_S1	Indefinite-lived intangible assets (e.g., trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are assessed at least annually for impairment during the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P125_S2	Other intangible assets (e.g., non-compete agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately 2 years to 20 years.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	Intangible assets related to license agreements were amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on the terms of the respective agreements.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P126_S1	The costs incurred and expensed by the Company to extend or renew the term of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2015 and 2014 were not significant to the Company s results of operations.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	As of the Company s annual step-one goodwill impairment test on April 1, 2013, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Darphin reporting unit exceeded its fair value.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge for the remainder of the goodwill related to the Darphin reporting unit of $9.6 million.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	The fair value of the reporting unit was based upon the income approach, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P130_S1	The Company also determined that the carrying value of the Darphin trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, which was based on the use of a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows ( relief-from-royalty method ).
1001250_15_ITEM15_P130_S2	As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $8.1 million for the remaining carrying value of the related trademark.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P133_S1	A portion of these earnings are taxed in the United States.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company s actual effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes is as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	Income tax reserve adjustments represent changes in the Company s net liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to prior-year tax positions including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	Federal income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $2,918 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2015.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P136_S1	The Company intends to reinvest these earnings in its foreign operations indefinitely, except where it is able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	The determination and estimation of the future income tax consequences in all relevant taxing jurisdictions involves the application of highly complex tax laws in the countries involved, particularly in the United States, and is based on the tax profile of the Company in the year of earnings repatriation.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P160_S2	As a result of the treasury lock agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the effective interest rate on the 2033 Senior Notes will be 5.395% over the life of the debt.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P161_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P162_S0	The Company has a $1.0 billion commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper in the United States.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P162_S1	At June 30, 2015, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P162_S2	At August 14, 2015, the Company had $220.0 million of commercial paper outstanding, which may be refinanced on a periodic basis as it matures at then-prevailing market interest rates.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P163_S0	The Company has a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility ) that the Company extended by one year and is currently set to expire on July 15, 2020.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P163_S1	The Company has a remaining option to extend the Facility one more year.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P163_S2	At June 30, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P164_S0	The Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P164_S1	Up to the equivalent of $350 million of the Facility is available for multi-currency loans.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P164_S2	The interest rate on borrowings under the Facility is based on LIBOR or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or % plus the Federal funds rate.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P164_S3	The Company incurred costs of approximately $1.0 million to establish the Facility, which costs are being amortized over the term of the Facility.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P164_S4	The Facility has an annual fee of $0.6 million, payable quarterly, based on the Company s current credit ratings.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P164_S5	The Facility also contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $150.0 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under the Facility.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P165_S0	The Company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P165_S1	Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P165_S2	During fiscal 2015 and 2014, the monthly average amount outstanding was approximately $15.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively, and the annualized monthly weighted-average interest rate incurred was approximately 11.3% and 9.2%, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P166_S0	Refer to Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies for the Company s projected debt service payments, as of June 30, 2015, over the next five fiscal years.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P167_S0	The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P167_S1	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P167_S2	In addition, the Company enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P167_S3	The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P167_S4	The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P167_S5	Costs associated with entering into derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company s consolidated financial results.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P168_S0	For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P169_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P169_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedges and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P169_S2	If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P170_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P171_S0	The fair values of the Company s derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets are presented as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P172_S0	(1) See Note 12 Fair Value Measurements for further information about how the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities are determined.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P173_S0	The amounts of the gains and losses related to the Company s derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are presented as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P174_S0	(1) The amount of gain (loss) recognized in earnings related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing was $(1.5) million and $0.4 million for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P174_S1	The gain (loss) recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationships was $1.8 million and $(0.5) million for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P175_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P176_S0	Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P177_S0	(1) Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P178_S0	The amounts of the gains and losses related to the Company s derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments are presented as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P179_S0	Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P180_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P180_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P181_S0	The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P181_S1	The Company may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P181_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of June 2017.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P181_S3	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P181_S4	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P182_S0	The ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and option contracts is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P182_S1	For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P182_S2	If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period earnings.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P182_S3	As of June 30, 2015, the Company s foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P183_S0	At June 30, 2015, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $2,193.2 million.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P183_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($418.2 million), British pound ($409.3 million), Chinese yuan ($168.2 million), Swiss franc ($168.1 million), Canadian dollar ($158.4 million), Hong Kong dollar ($137.7 million) and Australian dollar ($123.0 million).
1001250_15_ITEM15_P184_S0	At June 30, 2014, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $1,597.3 million.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P184_S1	The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound ($267.2 million), Euro ($239.8 million), Swiss franc ($170.4 million), Canadian dollar ($138.6 million), Australian dollar ($111.3 million), Japanese yen ($108.0 million) and Hong Kong dollar ($103.0 million).
1001250_15_ITEM15_P185_S0	In April and May 2015, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2045 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, which were designated as cash-flow hedges.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P185_S1	See Note 10 Debt for further discussion.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P186_S0	The estimated net gain on the Company s derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges as of June 30, 2015 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $22.8 million.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P186_S1	The accumulated gain (loss) on derivative instruments in AOCI was $68.4 million and $(1.2) million as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P187_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P188_S0	The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness and anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the identified exposures.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P188_S1	The Company has interest rate swap agreements, with a notional amount totaling $250.0 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2022 Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on three-month LIBOR plus a margin.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P188_S2	These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair-value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P189_S0	As a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P189_S1	The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P189_S2	Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $43.1 million at June 30, 2015.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P189_S3	To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P189_S4	Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P190_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company renegotiated the terms related to certain of its derivative financial instruments that contained credit-risk-related contingent features.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P190_S1	As a result, the Company no longer holds instruments that contain such features.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P191_S0	The Company records certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P191_S1	The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that require initial remeasurement or remeasurement at fair value, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations and goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P192_S0	The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P192_S1	The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P193_S0	Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P194_S0	Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P195_S0	Level 3: Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P195_S1	The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument s valuation.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P196_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2015:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P197_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P198_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2014:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P199_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P200_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P201_S0	Cash and cash equivalents Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, money market funds and time deposits.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P201_S1	The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P202_S0	Available-for-sale securities Available-for-sale securities classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy are generally comprised of mutual funds and are valued using quoted market prices on an active exchange.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P202_S1	Available-for-sale securities classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy are valued using third-party pricing services and for time deposits, the carrying amount approximates fair value.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P202_S2	To determine fair value, the pricing services use market prices or prices derived from other observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P203_S0	Note receivable During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company amended the agreement related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields (a brand then owned by the Company) to receive a fixed amount in lieu of future contingent consideration and other rights.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P203_S1	The fair value of the receivable under the amended agreement was determined by discounting the future cash flows using an implied market rate of 6.1%.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P203_S2	This implied market rate reflected the Company s estimate of interest rates prevailing in the market for notes with comparable remaining maturities, the creditworthiness of the counterparty, and an assessment of the ultimate collectability of the instrument.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P203_S3	The implied market rate was deemed to be an unobservable input and as such the Company s note receivable was classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy as of June 30, 2014.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P203_S4	The remaining $8.4 million principal amount was received in August 2014.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P204_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P204_S1	The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P204_S2	To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to 12 months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than 12 months.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P205_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P206_S0	Interest rate swap contracts The fair values of the Company s interest rate swap contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P206_S1	The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and LIBOR forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P207_S0	Current and long-term debt The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P207_S1	To a lesser extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P207_S2	The Company s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P208_S0	Additional purchase price payable The Company s additional purchase price payable represents fixed minimum additional purchase price that was discounted using the Company s incremental borrowing rate, which was approximately 1%.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P208_S1	The additional purchase price payable is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P209_S0	The fair value of the Company s contingent consideration obligations is measured using Level 3 inputs which include a probability weighted-average cost of capital to discount estimated future cash flows based upon the likelihood of achieving certain future operating results.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P209_S1	The fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition earn-outs was determined by discounting the future cash flows using discount rates ranging from 9% to 14%.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P209_S2	These rates reflect the relative risk and probability of achieving future operating results with the potential earn-outs on the individual acquisitions.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P209_S3	These implied rates are deemed to be unobservable inputs and as such the Company s contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P209_S4	An increase or decrease in the risk premium of 100 basis points would result in a value that is approximately $6 million higher or lower than the current liability recorded.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P210_S0	Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P211_S0	The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P211_S1	Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P211_S2	In certain instances, the Company adjusts benefits in connection with international employee transfers.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P212_S0	The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P212_S1	The Company seeks to maintain appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P212_S2	For contributions, the Company would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ), as amended, and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P213_S0	The Company also has an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P214_S0	The Company maintains international pension plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P214_S1	The Company s funding policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P214_S2	The Company s most significant defined benefit pension obligations are included in the plan summaries below.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P215_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P216_S0	The Company maintains a domestic post-retirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P216_S1	Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they retire.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P216_S2	Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P216_S3	Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the retiree.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P216_S4	It is the Company s practice to fund these benefits as incurred and to provide discretionary funding for the future liability up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P217_S0	Certain of the Company s international subsidiaries and affiliates have post-retirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P218_S0	The significant components of the above mentioned plans as of and for the years ended June 30 are summarized as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P219_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P220_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P220_S1	The discount rate for the Company s Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P220_S2	The Company used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of the Company s Domestic Plans.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P220_S3	For the Company s international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P221_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P222_S0	Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P222_S1	The assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate for the coming year is 6.85% while the weighted-average ultimate trend rate of 4.54% is expected to be reached in approximately 13 years.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P222_S2	A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2015 would have had the following effects:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P223_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P224_S0	Amounts recognized in AOCI (before tax) as of June 30, 2015 are as follows:

1001250_15_ITEM15_P233_S1	The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P234_S0	The fair values are determined using the Net Asset Value ( NAV ) provided by the administrator of the fund.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P234_S1	These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P235_S0	The fair values are determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P292_S0	Certain non-employee directors defer cash compensation in the form of cash payout share units, which are not subject to the Plans.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P292_S1	These share units are classified as liabilities and, as such, their fair value is adjusted to reflect the current market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P292_S2	The Company recorded $3.4 million, $2.4 million and $3.0 million as compensation expense to reflect additional deferrals and the change in the market value for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P293_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P294_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share ( basic EPS ) is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain conditions).
1001250_15_ITEM15_P294_S1	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share assuming dilution ( diluted EPS ) is computed by reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P295_S0	A reconciliation between the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P296_S0	As of June 30, 2015, there were no anti-dilutive stock options to be excluded from the computation of diluted EPS.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P296_S1	As of June 30, 2014 and 2013, 0.1 million outstanding stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P296_S2	As of June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, 0.6 million, 0.5 million and 0.5 million, respectively, of PSUs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement of certain performance targets of the Company, as discussed in Note 16 Stock Programs.

1001250_15_ITEM15_P298_S0	The components of AOCI included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consist of the following:

1001250_15_ITEM15_P305_S0	Supplemental cash flow information is as follows:
1001250_15_ITEM15_P306_S0	Reportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Chief Executive ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P306_S1	As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P307_S0	Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P308_S0	While the Company s results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P308_S1	Accordingly, net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P308_S2	These product categories meet the definition of operating segments and, accordingly, additional financial data are provided below.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P309_S0	The other segment includes the sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P310_S0	Product category performance is measured based upon net sales before returns associated with restructuring activities, and earnings before income taxes, other income, interest expense, interest income and investment income, net, interest expense on debt extinguishment and total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P310_S1	Returns and charges associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to the product categories because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide program to redesign the Company s organizational structure.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P310_S2	The accounting policies for the Company s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales.
1001250_15_ITEM15_P310_S3	The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.

1001250_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The information required by this item is set forth in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risk and is incorporated herein by reference.
1001250_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this item appears beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and the Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date, due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change management over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the Company s financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	As a result, our business process automated and manual controls that are dependent on the affected general information technology controls were also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P1_S3	However, this material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements or restatement of prior-period financial statements, and there were no changes in previously released financial results.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	As a result of the material weakness noted above, we completed additional substantive procedures prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 ( Form 10-K ).
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Our CEO and CFO have certified that, based on such officer s knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-K. In addition, we have developed a remediation plan for this material weakness, which is described below.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the description of the material weakness are included on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The Company s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, which appears on page F-3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Except for the control deficiencies discussed above that have been assessed as a material weakness as of June 30, 2016, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Management is actively implementing a remediation plan to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated such that these controls will operate effectively.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The remediation actions we are taking, and expect to take, include: (i) improving general information technology program change control activities and policies, including processes to maintain sufficient documentation evidencing execution of these policies; (ii) improving the control activities and procedures associated with user access to certain information technology systems, including proper segregation of duties related to the affected information systems; (iii) educating and re-training control owners regarding internal control processes to mitigate identified risks and maintaining adequate documentation to evidence the effective design and operation of such processes and (iv) implementing enhanced controls to monitor the effectiveness of the underlying business process controls that are dependent on the data and financial reports generated from the relevant information systems.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We believe that these actions, and the improvements we expect to achieve as a result, will effectively remediate the material weakness.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	However, the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.
1001250_16_ITEM9A_P6_S2	We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed in fiscal 2017.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P10_S0	Management of The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. (including its subsidiaries) (the Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P13_S0	Under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P14_S1	During this assessment, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change management over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the Company s financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P14_S2	As a result, our business process automated and manual controls that are dependent on the affected general information technology controls were also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P14_S3	These control deficiencies are a result of insufficient awareness of, and training related to, internal control over financial reporting by information technology control owners in connection with a transition to a new information technology service provider.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P14_S4	However, this material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements or restatement of prior-period financial statements, and there were no changes in previously released financial results.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P14_S5	Based on this material weakness, the Company s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P15_S0	Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, which appears on page F-3 below.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P16_S0	The Est e Lauder Companies Inc.:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P17_S0	We have audited The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries ( the Company ) internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P17_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P17_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P18_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P18_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P18_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P18_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P18_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	A Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	A Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P20_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P21_S1	The following material weakness has been identified and included in management s assessment:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	There were ineffective general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change management over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the Company s financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P22_S1	As a result, business process automated and manual controls that are dependent on the affected general information technology controls were also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P22_S2	These control deficiencies are a result of insufficient awareness of, and training related to, internal control over financial reporting by information technology control owners in connection with a transition to a new information technology service provider.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2016.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2016 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated August 24, 2016, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	In our opinion, because of the effect of the aforementioned material weakness on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management s statements referring to corrective actions taken after June 30, 2016, relative to the aforementioned material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Est e Lauder Companies Inc.:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries ( the Company ) as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2016.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule as listed on the index on page F-1.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P27_S2	These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P27_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P28_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P29_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P29_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P43_S2	Certain subsidiaries of The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. are also the global licensee of the Tommy Hilfiger, Kiton, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, Ermenegildo Zegna, Tory Burch and AERIN brand names for fragrances and/or cosmetics.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company ).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company retrospectively adopted new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	As a result, the Company restated the June 30, 2015 consolidated balance sheet to reclassify $284.9 million related to deferred taxes from Prepaid expenses and other current assets to Other assets, and $5.9 million from Other accrued liabilities to Other noncurrent liabilities.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P45_S2	The Company also retrospectively adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P45_S3	As a result, the Company restated the June 30, 2015 balance sheet to reclassify $12.4 million from Other assets to Long-term debt.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, and income taxes.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P47_S2	Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange for the period.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	Unrealized translation gains (losses) reported as cumulative translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. amounted to $(108.2) million, $(322.5) million and $95.1 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	For the Company s Venezuelan subsidiary operating in a highly inflationary economy, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	Remeasurement adjustments in financial statements in a highly inflationary economy and other transactional gains and losses are reflected in earnings.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted changes to the foreign exchange controls that expanded the use of its then-existing exchange mechanisms and created another exchange control mechanism ( SICAD II ), which allowed companies to apply for the purchase of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated securities for any legal use or purpose.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	The Company considered its specific facts and circumstances in determining the appropriate remeasurment rate and determined the SICAD II rate was the most appropriate rate that reflected the economics of its Venezuelan subsidiary s business as of March 24, 2014, when the SICAD II mechanism became operational.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P51_S2	As a result, the Company changed the exchange rate used to remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan subsidiary from 6.3 to the SICAD II rate, which was 49.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P51_S3	98 as of June 30, 2014.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P51_S4	Accordingly, a remeasurement charge of $38.3 million, on a before and after tax basis, was reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2014.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	In February 2015, the Venezuelan government introduced an open market foreign exchange system ( SIMADI ).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	As a result, the Company recorded a remeasurement charge of $5.3 million, on a before and after tax basis, for the year ended June 30, 2015.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	In March 2016, the Venezuelan government made changes to certain of its foreign currency exchange systems.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	As part of these changes, a new free-floating exchange rate mechanism ( DICOM ) replaced the SIMADI foreign exchange system and is the only mechanism legally available for the Company s highest priority transactions, which are the import of goods.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P53_S2	This change had a de minimis impact on the Company s consolidated statements of earnings.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P53_S3	The Company s Venezuelan subsidiary is not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements or liquidity at June 30, 2016.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	Accordingly, the Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange (gains) losses on foreign currency transactions, including the effect of the Venezuela remeasurement charges, of $(15.7) million, $(4.1) million and $46.7 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include $204.5 million and $373.4 million of short-term time deposits at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company s investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in the Company s investment policy.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	These investments are classified as available-for-sale, with any temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an investment presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	See Note 12 Fair Value Measurements for further information about how the fair values of investments are determined.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Investments in privately-held companies in which the Company has significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	These investments were not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and are included in Long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss positions for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P60_S1	Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P60_S2	Factors considered by the Company include, but are not limited to (i) the length of time and extent the security has been in a material loss position; (ii) the financial condition and creditworthiness of the issuer; (iii) future economic conditions and market forecasts related to the issuer s industry, sector, or geography; (iv) the Company s intent and ability to retain its investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value; and (v) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of market value.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	Accounts receivable is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions totaling $24.1 million and $20.6 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	Inventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	Cost components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as inbound freight.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P62_S2	M anufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity .
1001250_16_ITEM15_P62_S3	Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company s customers.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	Included in inventory and promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P63_S3	In addition, and as necessary, specific reserves for future known or anticipated events may be established.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ( fair-value hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash-flow hedge), or (iii) not designated as a hedging instrument.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P65_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge that is highly effective are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P65_S3	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash-flow hedge of a forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in OCI.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P65_S4	Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P65_S5	Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company s operating segments.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P72_S2	The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P72_S3	The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P72_S4	When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P72_S5	If necessary, the quantitative impairment test is performed in two steps: (i) the Company determines if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P72_S6	When testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company also has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	For fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for the majority of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying value.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P74_S2	The Company considered macroeconomic factors including the global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible assets are employed, and the growth of the global prestige beauty industry.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P74_S3	In addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, the Company considered the reporting units current results and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business climate factors, changes in the industry/competitive environment, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and its intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of a trademark.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	For those reporting units acquired in fiscal 2015, a quantitative assessment was performed.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Company engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P76_S2	To determine the fair value of the reporting units, the Company used an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	Under the income approach, we determined fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflected the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	Under the market approach, we utilized market multiples from publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P77_S2	The key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P78_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P79_S1	The Company s sales that are subject to credit risk are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries, specialty multi-brand retailers and retailers in its travel retail business.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P79_S2	The Company grants credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company s largest customer sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for $1,064.5 million, or 9%, $1,060.4 million, or 10%, and $1,142.7 million, or 10%, of the Company s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	This customer accounted for $164.0 million, or 13%, and $139.1 million, or 12%, of the Company s accounts receivable at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P81_S2	In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at the Company s retail stores.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company records revenues generated from purchase with purchase promotions in Net Sales and costs of its purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions in Cost of Sales.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Company s practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested and approved.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P83_S2	In accepting returns, the Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P83_S3	As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.1% in fiscal 2016 and 3.4% in fiscal 2015 and 2014.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	Certain incentive arrangements require the payment of a fee to customers based on their attainment of pre-established sales levels.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P84_S1	These fees have been accrued and recorded as a reduction of Net Sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were not material to the results of operations in any period presented.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company enters into transactions related to demonstration, advertising and counter construction, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P85_S1	These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P85_S2	To the extent the Company receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for consideration and the fair-value of the benefit can be reasonably estimated, the Company s share of the counter depreciation and the other costs of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were approximately $1,387 million, $1,378 million and $1,410 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development were $2,820.7 million, $2,771.5 million and $2,840.0 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are expensed as incurred.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P87_S1	Excluding the impact of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions, costs for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings were $2,607.3 million, $2,558.6 million and $2,618.1 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	Research and development costs of $191.3 million, $178.1 million and $157.9 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and are expensed as incurred.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	Shipping and handling expenses of $362.6 million, $363.6 million and $373.6 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and include distribution center costs, third-party logistics costs and outbound freight.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	The Company considers lease renewals when such renewals are reasonably assured.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding from its lessors.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P91_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as a reduction of rent expense.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company s license agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors trademarks.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P92_S1	Our current licenses have an initial term of approximately 5 years to 10 years, and are renewable subject to the Company s compliance with the license agreement provisions.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P92_S2	Most of our license agreements have renewal terms in 5 year increments, with potential renewal periods ranging from approximately 5 years to 25 years.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P92_S3	Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	Most of the Company s licenses were entered into to create new business.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P93_S1	In some cases, the Company acquired, or entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a pre-existing beauty products business.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P93_S2	In those cases, other intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P94_S1	Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P95_S1	Upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock units, performance share units, performance share units based on total stockholder return and long-term performance share units, the resulting excess tax benefits, if any, are credited to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P95_S2	Any resulting tax deficiencies will first be offset against those cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P95_S3	If the cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital are exhausted, tax deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P96_S2	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P96_S3	If the Company s assessment of realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P98_S2	The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P98_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P98_S4	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P99_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P99_S2	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P100_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities would no longer be able to recognize debt issuance costs as an asset in the balance sheet.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P100_S2	The amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P100_S3	The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P100_S4	Upon adoption, the Company applied the new guidance on a retrospective basis and complied with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle, as required.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	Adopted date The Company adopted this guidance retrospectively during the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company restated the June 30, 2015 balance sheet to reclassify $12.4 million from Other assets to Long-term debt.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	Deferred Income Taxes As part of their simplification initiative to reduce the complexity in accounting standards, in November 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P103_S1	Under current guidance, deferred taxes for each jurisdiction are presented on a net current and net noncurrent basis, requiring an in depth analysis by jurisdiction to make the allocation.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P103_S2	The updated guidance simplified the Company s analysis by eliminating the requirement to allocate between current and noncurrent deferred taxes by jurisdiction.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	Adopted date The Company adopted this guidance retrospectively during the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company restated the June 30, 2015 consolidated balance sheet to reclassify $284.9 million related to deferred taxes from Prepaid expenses and other current assets to Other assets and $5.9 million from Other accrued liabilities to Other noncurrent liabilities.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P106_S0	Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires companies to utilize an impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other financial instruments, which include trade and other receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, to record an allowance for credit risk based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P106_S1	In addition, this new guidance changes the recognition method for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities, which can occur as a result of market and credit risk, as well as additional disclosures.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P106_S2	In general, this guidance will require modified retrospective adoption for all outstanding instruments that fall under this guidance.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	Effective date This guidance becomes effective for the Company s fiscal 2021 first quarter .
1001250_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company is currently evaluating the impact of applying this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	In March 2016, as part of its simplification initiative, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the way companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P110_S1	This new guidance requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based compensation awards be recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P110_S2	In addition, companies are required to treat the tax effects of exercised or vested awards as discrete items in the period that they occur.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P110_S3	This guidance also permits an employer to withhold up to the maximum statutory withholding rates in a jurisdiction without triggering liability classification, allows companies to elect to account for forfeitures as they occur, and provides requirements for the cash flow classification of cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes and for the classification of excess tax benefits.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P110_S4	The new guidance prescribes different transition methods for the various provisions.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	Effective date This guidance becomes effective for the Company s fiscal 2018 first quarter, with early adoption permitted .
1001250_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company is currently evaluating the impact of applying this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheets with the liability being equal to the present value of the lease payments.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P113_S1	The right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability adjusted for certain costs such as direct costs.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P113_S2	Lease expense will be recognized similar to current accounting guidance with operating leases resulting in a straight-line expense, and financing leases resulting in a front-loaded expense similar to the current accounting for capital leases.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P113_S3	This guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements, and provides for certain practical expedients.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	Effective date This guidance becomes effective for the Company s fiscal 2020 first quarter, with early adoption permitted .
1001250_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company is currently evaluating the impact of applying this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines how companies should report revenues from contracts with customers.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P117_S1	It provides companies with a single comprehensive five-step principles-based model to use in accounting for revenue and supersedes current revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific and transaction-specific revenue guidance.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the principal versus agent guidance in its new revenue recognition standard.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P118_S1	These amendments do not change the key aspects of the principal versus agent guidance, including the definition that an entity is a principal if it controls the good or service prior to it being transferred to a customer, but the amendments clarify the implementation guidance related to the considerations that must be made during the contract evaluation process.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	In April 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the new standard to clarify the guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarified certain terms, guidance and disclosure requirements during the transition period related to completed contracts and contract modifications.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P120_S1	In addition, the FASB provided clarification on the concept of collectability, the calculation of the fair value of noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to reflect the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff s rescission of their prior comments that covered, among other things, accounting for shipping and handling costs and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	Effective date In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P122_S1	As a result, the new standard is not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P122_S2	An entity is permitted to apply the foregoing guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented, with certain practical expedients, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company will apply all of this new guidance when it becomes effective in fiscal 2019 and has not yet selected a transition method.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P124_S1	The Company currently has an implementation team in place that is performing a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	No other recently issued accounting pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P136_S0	The Company assigns goodwill of a reporting unit to the product category in which that reporting unit predominantly operates at the time of acquisition.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P136_S1	The following table presents goodwill by product category and the related change in the carrying amount:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P137_S0	Other intangible assets include trademarks and patents, as well as license agreements and other intangible assets resulting from or related to businesses and assets purchased by the Company.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P137_S1	Indefinite-lived intangible assets (e.g., trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are assessed at least annually for impairment during the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P137_S2	Other intangible assets (e.g., non-compete agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately 2 years to 20 years.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P138_S0	Intangible assets related to license agreements were amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on the terms of the respective agreements.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P138_S1	The costs incurred and expensed by the Company to extend or renew the term of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2016 and 2015 were not significant to the Company s results of operations.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P144_S0	Employee-Related Costs Employee-related costs are primarily comprised of severance and other post-employment benefit costs, calculated based on salary levels, prior service and other statutory minimum benefits, if applicable.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P144_S1	Employee-related costs are expensed when specific employees have been identified and when payment is probable and estimable, which generally occurs upon approval of the related initiative by management with authority delegated from the Company s Board of Directors.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P145_S0	Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs primarily consist of asset write-offs or accelerated depreciation related to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to their existing useful life as a direct result of a restructuring initiative.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P145_S1	The accelerated portion of depreciation expense will be expensed on a straight-line basis and be classified as restructuring charges, while the portion relating to the previous existing useful life will continue to be reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P146_S0	Contract Terminations Costs related to contract terminations include continuing payments to a third-party after the Company has ceased benefiting from the rights conveyed in the contract, or a payment made to terminate a contract prior to its expiration.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P146_S1	These may include continuing operating lease payments (less estimated sublease payments) to a landlord after exiting a location prior to the lease-end date as a direct result of an approved restructuring initiative.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P146_S2	Contract terminations also include minimum payments or fees related to the early termination of license or other personal services contracts.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P146_S3	Costs related to contract terminations are expensed upon the cease-use date of a leased property or upon the notification date to the third party in the event of a license or personal service contract termination.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P151_S0	In October 2015, officers authorized by the Company s Board of Directors approved plans to transform and modernize the Company s global technology infrastructure ( GTI ) to fundamentally change the way it delivers information technology services internally (such initiative, the GTI Restructuring ).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P151_S1	As part of the GTI Restructuring, the Company transitioned its GTI from Company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where it pays for services as they are used.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P151_S2	This model, with a different third-party provider, is expected to provide an enhanced scalable platform to better support current and future requirements, help the Company achieve key strategic opportunities and improve the Company s agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P151_S3	The implementation of the GTI Restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P152_S0	The following table presents GTI Restructuring charges and the related activities under this initiative to date:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P153_S0	Accrued GTI Restructuring charges at June 30, 2016 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations in fiscal 2017.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P154_S0	Other charges in connection with the implementation of this initiative were $7.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 and primarily relate to consulting services.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P154_S1	These charges are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P155_S0	On May 3, 2016, the Company announced a multi-year initiative ( Leading Beauty Forward or LBF ) to build on its strengths and better leverage its cost structure to free resources for investment to continue its growth momentum.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P155_S1	LBF is designed to enhance the Company s go-to-market capabilities, reinforce its leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P156_S0	The Company plans to approve specific initiatives under LBF through fiscal 2019 and expects to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P156_S1	The Company expects that LBF will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million before taxes.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P157_S0	Restructuring actions to be taken over the duration of LBF involve the redesigning, resizing and reorganization of select corporate functions and go-to-market structures to improve effectiveness and create cost-efficiencies in support of increased investment in growth drivers.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P158_S0	As the Company continues to grow, it is important to more efficiently support its diverse portfolio of brands, channels and geographies in the rapidly evolving prestige beauty environment.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P158_S1	The initiatives being evaluated include the creation of a shared-services structure, either through Company-owned or third-party service providers in existing or lower-cost locations.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P158_S2	The Company also believes that decision-making in key areas of innovation, marketing and digital communications should be moved closer to the consumer to increase speed and local relevance.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P159_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P160_S0	In connection with LBF, at this time, the Company estimates a net reduction in the range of approximately 900 to 1,200 positions globally, which is about 2.5% of its current workforce.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P160_S1	This reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P161_S0	Specific actions taken since the Program inception included:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P162_S0	The Company approved initiatives to realign and optimize its organization to better leverage scale, improve productivity, reduce complexity and achieve cost savings across various functions, including research and development, global information systems and human resources.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P162_S1	These actions will result in a net reduction of the workforce, which includes position eliminations, the re-leveling of certain positions and an investment in new capabilities.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P162_S2	The Company also approved consulting and other professional services related to the design of the future structures, processes and technologies of certain corporate functions including finance, legal, real estate, human resources and global consumer care, as well as the initial organizational design phase of a potential shared-services support structure.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P162_S3	To a lesser extent, also included in the approved other charges are costs to establish a Leading Beauty Forward PMO.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P163_S0	Optimize Supply Chain An initiative to centralize the Company s supply chain management, and redesign of supply chain planning and transportation management activities, was approved.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P163_S1	This initiative includes the relocation of certain operations and positions, with some employees being separated and positions replaced in a new location.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P163_S2	Other charges approved are primarily related to consulting fees for design and implementation, temporary labor backfill during the transition and project management costs.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P164_S0	The Company approved initiatives to enhance its go-to-market support structures and achieve synergies across certain geographic regions, brands and channels.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P164_S1	These initiatives are primarily intended to shift certain areas of focus from traditional to social and digital marketing strategies to provide enhanced consumer experience, as well as to support expanded omnichannel opportunities.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P164_S2	These actions will result in a net reduction of the workforce, which includes position eliminations, the re-leveling of certain positions and an investment in new capabilities.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P165_S0	Exit Underperforming Businesses To further improve profitability in certain areas of the Company s brands and regions, the Company approved initiatives to exit certain businesses in select markets and channels of distribution.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P165_S1	The Company has also decided to close a number of underperforming freestanding retail stores and exit mid-tier department stores for certain brands in the United States to redirect resources to other retail locations and channels with potential for greater profitability.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P165_S2	These activities will result in product returns, inventory write-offs, reduction of workforce, accelerated depreciation and termination of contracts.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P172_S0	A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company s actual effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes is as follows:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P173_S0	Income tax reserve adjustments represent changes in the Company s net liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to prior-year tax positions including the impact of tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P174_S0	Federal income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $3,548 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2016.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P174_S1	The Company intends to reinvest these earnings in its foreign operations indefinitely, except where it is able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P175_S0	The determination and estimation of the future income tax consequences in all relevant taxing jurisdictions involves the application of highly complex tax laws in the countries involved, particularly in the United States, and is based on the tax profile of the Company in the year of earnings repatriation.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P175_S1	Accordingly, it is not practicable to determine the amount of tax associated with such undistributed earnings.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P185_S1	The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of income tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P186_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company formally concluded the compliance process with respect to fiscal 2015 under the IRS CAP.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P186_S1	The conclusion of this process did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P205_S0	The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P205_S1	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P205_S2	In addition, the Company enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P205_S3	The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P205_S4	The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P205_S5	Costs associated with entering into derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company s consolidated financial results.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P206_S0	For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P207_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P207_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedges and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P207_S2	If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P214_S0	Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationships:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P215_S0	(1) Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P216_S0	The amounts of the gains and losses related to the Company s derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments are presented as follows:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P217_S0	Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P218_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P218_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P219_S0	The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P219_S1	The Company may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P219_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of June 2018.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P219_S3	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P219_S4	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P220_S0	The Company enters into interest rate forward contracts to hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P220_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the cost of debt issuance.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P221_S0	The ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and interest rate derivatives is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P221_S1	For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P221_S2	If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period earnings.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P221_S3	As of June 30, 2016, the Company s foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P222_S0	At June 30, 2016, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $3,265.2 million.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P226_S0	The estimated net gain on the Company s derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges as of June 30, 2016 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $14.6 million.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P226_S1	The accumulated gain on derivative instruments in AOCI was $50.2 million and $68.4 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P227_S0	The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P227_S1	The Company has interest rate swap agreements, with a notional amount totaling $250.0 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2022 Senior Notes to variable interest rates based on three-month LIBOR plus a margin.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P227_S2	These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair-value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P228_S0	As a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P228_S1	The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P228_S2	Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $65.2 million at June 30, 2016.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P228_S3	To manage this risk, the Company has strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P228_S4	Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P229_S0	The Company records certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P229_S1	The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that require initial measurement or remeasurement at fair value, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations and goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P230_S0	The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P230_S1	The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P231_S0	Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P232_S0	Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P233_S0	Level 3: Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P233_S1	The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument s valuation.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P236_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2015:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P237_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P238_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P239_S0	Cash and cash equivalents Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, money market funds and time deposits.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P239_S1	The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P240_S0	Available-for-sale securities Available-for-sale securities are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and are valued using third-party pricing services, and for time deposits, the carrying amount approximates fair value .
1001250_16_ITEM15_P240_S1	To determine fair value, the pricing services use market prices or prices derived from other observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P241_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P241_S1	The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P241_S2	To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to 12 months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than 12 months.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P242_S0	Interest rate swap contracts The fair values of the Company s interest rate swap contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P242_S1	The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and LIBOR forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P243_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P244_S0	Current and long-term debt The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P244_S1	To a lesser extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P244_S2	The Company s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P245_S0	Additional purchase price payable The Company s additional purchase price payable represents fixed minimum additional purchase price that was discounted using the Company s incremental borrowing rate, which was approximately 1%.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P245_S1	The additional purchase price payable is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P246_S0	Contingent Consideration Contingent consideration obligations consist of potential obligations related to our acquisitions.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P246_S1	The amounts to be paid under these obligations are contingent upon the achievement of stipulated financial targets by the business subsequent to acquisition.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P246_S2	The fair values of the contingent consideration related to certain acquisition earn-outs were estimated using a probability-weighted discount model that considers the achievement of the conditions upon which the respective contingent obligation is dependent ( Monte Carlo Method ).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P246_S3	The Monte Carlo Method has various inputs into the valuation model that include the risk-adjusted projected future operating results of the acquired entity, a risk-adjusted discount rate ranging from 1.1% to 1.6%, a measure of revenue volatility ranging from 4.6% to 13.5%, an asset volatility ranging from 27.6% to 30.0% and a revenue/earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization correlation factor ranging from 80% to 90%.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P246_S4	Significant changes in the projected future operating results would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P246_S5	Changes to the discount rate, volatility or correlation factors would have a lesser effect.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P247_S0	The implied rates are deemed to be unobservable inputs and, as such, the Company s contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P248_S0	Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were as follows:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P249_S0	The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P249_S1	Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P249_S2	In certain instances, the Company adjusts benefits in connection with international employee transfers.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P250_S0	The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P250_S1	The Company seeks to maintain appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P250_S2	For contributions, the Company would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ), as amended, and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P251_S0	The Company also has an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P252_S0	The Company maintains international pension plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P252_S1	The Company s funding policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P252_S2	The Company s most significant defined benefit pension obligations are included in the plan summaries below.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P253_S0	The Company maintains a domestic post-retirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P253_S1	Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they retire.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P253_S2	Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P253_S3	Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the retiree.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P253_S4	It is the Company s practice to fund these benefits as incurred and to provide discretionary funding for the future liability up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P254_S0	Certain of the Company s international subsidiaries and affiliates have post-retirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P256_S0	The significant components of the above mentioned plans as of and for the years ended June 30 are summarized as follows:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P257_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P258_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P258_S1	The discount rate for the Company s Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P258_S2	The Company used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of the Company s Domestic Plans.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P258_S3	For the Company s international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P259_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P260_S0	Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P260_S1	The assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate for the coming year is 7.67% while the weighted-average ultimate trend rate of 4.53% is expected to be reached in approximately 21 years.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P260_S2	A 100 basis-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2016 would have had the following effects:

1001250_16_ITEM15_P267_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P268_S0	The Company s investment strategy for its pension and post-retirement plan assets is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset classes with the primary goal of meeting long-term cash requirements as they become due.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P268_S1	Assets are primarily invested in diversified funds that hold equity or debt securities to maintain the security of the funds while maximizing the returns within each plan s investment policy.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P268_S2	The investment policy for each plan specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance, as well as investment manager performance.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P271_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash and time deposits.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P271_S1	The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P272_S0	The fair values are determined using the Net Asset Value ( NAV ) provided by the administrator of the fund.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P272_S1	These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P273_S0	The fair values are determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P273_S1	These investments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P274_S0	Debt instruments The fair values are determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from observable market inputs such as credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, benchmark curves and other industry and economic factors.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P276_S1	The fair values for non-publicly traded funds are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P277_S0	Those investments where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P277_S1	When the Company is unable to redeem in the near term, these investments are classified within Level 3.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P278_S0	Insurance contracts The fair values are based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the creditworthiness of the issuer.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P278_S1	The underlying investments are primarily government, asset-backed and fixed income securities.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P279_S0	Insurance contracts are generally classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices or other observable inputs for pricing.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P280_S0	Interests in limited partnerships and hedge fund investments The fair values are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator of the partnership/fund.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P290_S2	Projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2016.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P291_S0	(2) Minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P292_S0	Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, as well as common area maintenance.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P292_S1	These amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P292_S2	Such amounts have not been material to total rent expense.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P292_S3	Total rental expense included in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was $441.8 million, $402.2 million and $356.1 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P313_S0	The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P314_S0	The Company uses a weighted-average expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P314_S1	The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P315_S0	For the weighted-average expected option life assumption, the Company considers the exercise behavior for past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P315_S1	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate for the expected term of the options and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P316_S0	The Company granted approximately 1,610,300 RSUs during fiscal 2016 which, at the time of grant, were scheduled to vest as follows: 546,000 in fiscal 2017, 566,800 in fiscal 2018 and 497,500 in fiscal 2019.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P318_S1	Settlement will be made pursuant to a range of opportunities relative to the net sales, diluted net earnings per common share and return on invested capital targets of the Company and, as such, the compensation cost of the PSU is subject to adjustment based upon the attainability of these target goals.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P322_S2	The remaining PSUs will be settled based upon the Company s relative total stockholder return ( TSR ) over the relevant performance period as compared to companies in the S P 500 on July 1, 2012.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P322_S3	No settlement will occur on the remaining PSUs if the Company s TSR falls below a minimum threshold, and up to an aggregate of 86,806 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock will be issued depending on the extent to which the Company s TSR equals or exceeds the minimum threshold.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P323_S0	The grant date fair value of the PSUs of $11.0 million was estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions for each performance period, respectively: contractual life of 33, 45 and 57 months, average risk-free interest rate of 0.3%, 0.5% and 0.7% and a dividend yield of 1.0%.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P324_S0	Using the historical stock prices and dividends from public sources, the Company estimated the covariance structure of the returns on S P 500 stocks.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P324_S1	The volatility for the Company s stock produced by this estimation was 32%.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P324_S2	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rates over the contractual term of the grant, and the dividend yield is based on historical experience.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P325_S1	Since the Company achieved positive Net Earnings, as defined in the PSU award agreement, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, performance and vesting of each tranche will be based on the Company achieving positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the PSU award agreement, during the relative performance period.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P325_S2	Payment with respect to a tranche will be made on the third anniversary of the last day of the respective performance period.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P325_S3	The PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as the payment of shares of Class A Common Stock.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P325_S4	The grant date fair value of these PSUs of $30.0 million was estimated using the closing stock price of the Company s Class A Common Stock as of September 4, 2015, the date of grant.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P326_S2	Payment with respect to a tranche will be made within 30 business days of the date on which the PSUs vest.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P326_S3	The PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as the payment of shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P326_S4	The grant date fair value of these PSUs of $6.0 million was estimated using the closing stock price of the Company s Class A Common Stock as of January 28, 2016, the date of grant.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P328_S0	The Company grants share units to certain non-employee directors under the Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Share Incentive Plan.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P328_S1	The share units are convertible into shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock as provided for in that plan.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P328_S2	Share units are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that are converted to additional share units when such dividends are declared.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P329_S0	The following is a summary of the status of the Company s share units as of June 30, 2016 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P330_S0	Certain non-employee directors defer cash compensation in the form of cash payout share units, which are not subject to the Plans.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P330_S1	These share units are classified as liabilities and, as such, their fair value is adjusted to reflect the current market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P330_S2	The Company recorded $1.7 million, $3.4 million and $2.4 million as compensation expense to reflect additional deferrals and the change in the market value for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P331_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share ( basic EPS ) is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain conditions).
1001250_16_ITEM15_P331_S1	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. per common share assuming dilution ( diluted EPS ) is computed by reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P332_S0	A reconciliation between the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P333_S0	As of June 30, 2016, there were 0.2 million stock options excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P333_S1	As of June 30, 2015, there were no anti-dilutive stock options to be excluded from the computation of diluted EPS.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P333_S2	As of June 30, 2014, there were 0.1 million anti-dilutive stock options excluded from the computation of diluted EPS.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P333_S3	As of June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 0.5 million, 0.6 million and 0.5 million, respectively, of PSUs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement of certain performance targets of the Company, as discussed in Note 16 Stock Programs.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P342_S0	Supplemental cash flow information is as follows:
1001250_16_ITEM15_P343_S0	Reportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Chief Executive ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P343_S1	As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P344_S0	Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P345_S0	While the Company s results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P345_S1	Accordingly, net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P345_S2	These product categories meet the definition of operating segments and, accordingly, additional financial data are provided below.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P346_S0	The other segment includes the sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P347_S0	Product category performance is measured based upon net sales before returns associated with restructuring activities, and earnings before income taxes, other income, interest expense, interest income and investment income, net, and charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P347_S1	Returns and charges associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to the product categories because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures, and to transform and modernize the Company s GTI.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P347_S2	The accounting policies for the Company s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales.
1001250_16_ITEM15_P347_S3	The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.

1001250_16_ITEM15_P383_S0	There were ineffective general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change management over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the Company s financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting.

1001250_16_ITEM1_P48_S4	This includes strategically deploying our brands and tailoring product assortments and communications to fit local tastes and preferences in cities and neighborhoods.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P48_S5	Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house teams that design and produce the sales materials, social media strategies, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P48_S6	We build brand equity and drive traffic to retail locations and to our own and authorized retailers websites through digital and social media, magazines and newspapers, television, billboards in cities and airports, and direct mail and email.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P48_S7	In addition, we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products not only in publications and other traditional media, but increasingly in digital and social media, leveraging significant opportunities for amplification.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	We are increasing our brand awareness and sales by continuing to elevate our digital presence encompassing e-commerce and m-commerce, as well as digital and social media.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	In order to continue to offer unparalleled service and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online, we continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), support e-commerce and m-commerce businesses via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement, and support our authorized retailers to strengthen their e-commerce businesses and drive sales of our brands on their websites.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	We have opportunities to expand our balanced brand portfolio online around the world, and we are investing in and testing new omnichannel concepts in the United States and other established markets to increase brand loyalty by better serving consumers as they shop across channels.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	We have dedicated resources to implement creative, coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Promotional activities and in-store displays are designed to attract new consumers and introduce existing consumers to other product offerings from the respective brands.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as sampling programs, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase, and we continue to believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	Such activities attract consumers to our counters and websites and keep existing consumers engaged.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers, retailers, beauty consultants and makeup artists at the points of sale to enable us to offer a seamless experience across channels of distribution.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Information systems support business processes including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	We continue to maintain and enhance these systems in alignment with our long-term strategy.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Certain elements of our information technology infrastructure are managed by third-party providers.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	We have executed our plans to transform and modernize our global technology infrastructure ( GTI ) to fundamentally change the way we deliver information technology services internally (such initiative, the GTI Restructuring ).
1001250_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	As part of the GTI Restructuring, we transitioned our GTI from Company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where we pay for services as they are used.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P52_S3	This model, with a different third-party provider, is expected to provide an enhanced scalable platform to better support current and future requirements, help us achieve key strategic opportunities and improve our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P52_S4	This transition is also expected to result in operational efficiencies and reduce our information technology service and infrastructure costs in the future.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P52_S5	During fiscal 2016, we also completed the deployment of our core human resource ( HR ) transformation program globally.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P52_S6	This initiative should provide managers with greater visibility into our global workforce and provide managers and employees with better self-service HR capabilities.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	As we continue to strengthen and modernize our key processes, related systems and infrastructure, we continue to make investments to upgrade many of our legacy systems, including retail systems and retail capabilities globally.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	The retail system upgrades are expected to enhance the effectiveness of store operations, and support our omnichannel objectives.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	Over the next few years, we will continue to implement upgraded point of sale, retail merchandising, and retail workforce management solutions in certain key markets globally.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	Most of our locations are currently enabled with SAP-based technologies ( SAP ).
1001250_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	W e continue to develop and invest in new data insight and analytic capabilities to allow us to more effectively utilize the information provided by SAP, as well as strategic sources of both internal and external data.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	In addition, we are making continuous investments to integrate changes to systems applications with SAP that we expect will bring value creation to the business and increase productivity.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	In particular, initiatives are currently underway to optimize certain of our supply chain capabilities, including inventory and warehouse management, as well as adding capabilities to enhance certain financial processes and workforce management solutions.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our research and development group, which includes scientists and other employees involved in product innovation and packaging design and development, works closely with our marketing and product development teams and third-party suppliers to cultivate ideas, develop new products and product-line extensions, and create new packaging concepts, as well as to improve, redesign or reformulate existing products.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	In addition, these research and development personnel provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how to quality and assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products that meet or exceed consumer expectations.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	The research and development group has long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	Members of the research and development group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately 800 employees engaged in research and development activities.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see Item 2.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	We do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, and do not ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	We manufacture our products primarily in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies, minimize our impact on the environment and reduce costs.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	Our major manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily manufacture one category of product (e.g., makeup) for all of the principal brands.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P59_S4	While we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and third-party manufacturers is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity, technology, productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P59_S5	To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize a network of third-party manufacturers on a global basis.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	We have established regional distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P61_S2	Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations department.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P61_S3	We review our supplier base periodically with the specific objectives of improving quality, increasing innovation and speed-to-market and reducing costs.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P61_S4	In addition, we focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P61_S5	Some of our products rely on a single or limited number of suppliers; however, we believe that our portfolio of suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P61_S6	In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	We are continually benchmarking the performance of our supply chain and will change suppliers and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	There is vigorous competition within each market where our skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products are sold.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact consumers choices among competing products and brands.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	Advertising, promotion, social media activities, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store demonstrations also have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	With our numerous brands, sold in various channels, we are one of the world s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names.

1001250_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	We protect our trademarks in the United States and significant markets worldwide.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	In addition, several products and packaging for such products are covered by design patents or copyrights.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	While we consider these patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is considered material to the conduct of our business.

1001250_16_ITEM1_P70_S2	A limited number of employees outside of the United States are covered by a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, advertising, shipment, disposal and safety of our products.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable federal, state, local and international and other countries rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment or that relate to climate change.

1001250_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P73_S2	Many of our customers that are retailers follow a 4-4-5 retail calendar which may influence the amount and timing of their order placement and receipt of goods in any fiscal quarter.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	In a traditional 4-4-5 retail calendar, each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	As a result, our customers retail quarter-end and our fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions.
1001250_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.

1001250_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading prices of our securities, may be adversely affected.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and others are new companies competing in emerging distribution channels.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In some cases, our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors actions in these areas.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	A consolidation in the retail trade may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	This could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	A severe adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If one or more of our largest customers change their strategies (including pricing or promotional activities) or change or terminate their relationship with us, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our Company has a well-recognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by many factors.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If the Company s reputation is adversely affected, its ability to attract and retain customers and consumers could be impacted.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We must continually work to develop, manufacture and market new products, maintain and adapt our High-Touch services to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, successfully manage our inventories, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	The issue is compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our financial results will suffer.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P6_S6	In addition, from time to time, sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P6_S7	If such a situation persists or a number of brands fail to perform as expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Achieving our long-term strategy will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These investments may result in short-term costs without any current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings, at least in the short term.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We continuously review acquisition and investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If required, the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future, a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results, then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks, which may include:
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, and any adverse consequences associated with our acquisition activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	A general economic downturn, or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P18_S5	We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our inability to collect the receivable from one of our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P18_S7	If a retailer was to liquidate, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer s inventory of our products to protect brand equity.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, from events such as a pandemic, or other local or global health issues, conflicts around the world, or as a result of a terrorist attack, retaliation or similar threats, or as a result of adverse weather conditions, climate changes or seismic events, can have a short-term and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Events that impact consumers willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business, including travel retail, a significant contributor to our overall results, and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	A downturn in the economies of, or continuing recessions in, the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence, the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We remain cautious of the continued slow retail growth in Hong Kong, the decline in retail traffic primarily related to mid-tier department stores, as well as certain M A C freestanding stores, in the United States as a result of the impact of shifts in preferences of certain consumers as to where and how they shop for our products.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We also remain cautious of the continued strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Additionally, we are continuing to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environment in Brazil, the United Kingdom s anticipated exit from the European Union, the political instability in Turkey, the impact of declining oil prices on consumer purchases in the Middle East, and global security issues.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	While we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements, such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, laws and regulations relating to data privacy, anti-corruption, advertising, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, product registration, ingredients, chemicals and packaging, laws in Europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are involved, and may become involved in the future, in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that, if adversely decided or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, other disputes or regulatory proceedings.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In general, claims made by us or against us in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	As we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways, including the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, our product claims are found to be deceptive, or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers expectations, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and/or become subject to liability or claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our key personnel.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Competition for these employees can be intense.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P33_S5	This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are subject to risks related to our foreign operations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We operate on a global basis, with a majority of our fiscal 2016 net sales and operating income generated outside the United States.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely, except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	A majority of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the United States.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	adverse weather conditions, currency exchange controls, and social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	A disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Some of our products rely on single or a limited number of suppliers.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Further, the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities, in compliance with applicable standards, and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our information systems and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches, outages, and other risks.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We have information systems that support our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We have e-commerce, m-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and other events.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P44_S4	The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain information that is confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive, including personal information with respect to customers and employees.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Moreover, the success of our e-commerce and m-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and our employees and customers personal information, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees and customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P46_S5	In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We are subject to risks associated with our global information systems.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our implementation and maintenance of global information systems, including supply chain and finance systems, human resource management systems, creative asset management and retail operating systems, as well as associated hardware and use of cloud-based models, involve risks and uncertainties.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Failure to implement and maintain these and other systems as planned, in terms of timing, specifications, costs, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	As we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	As part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	These include certain information systems functions such as information technology operations, and certain human resource functions such as employee benefit plan administration.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In addition, if we transition systems to one or more new, or among existing, external service providers, we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal 2016, we provided guidance as to certain assumptions, including ranges for our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2016 and the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P53_S4	While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P53_S5	In addition, the longer-term guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	At any time, we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program, and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our net sales and/or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q).
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P56_S3	If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P56_S5	We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We are controlled by the Lauder family.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As a result of their control of us, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	As of August 18, 2016, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having approximately 87% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In addition, there are four members of the Lauder family who are employees, including three who are members of our Board of Directors.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Another family member is on our board and is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the Company, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets, for the foreseeable future.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a controlled company under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	As a controlled company, we are exempt under the New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements; (1) that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; (2) that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities; and (3) that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	While we have voluntarily caused our Board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and the Compensation Committee to have the required provisions, we are not requiring our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and Compensation Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors.
1001250_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	As a result of our use of the controlled company exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.
1001250_16_ITEM1B_P0_S0	As of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, there were no unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1001250_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following table sets forth our principal owned and leased manufacturing, assembly, research and development and distribution facilities as of August 18, 2016.
1001250_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The leases expire at various times through 2034 subject to certain renewal options.
1001250_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own, lease and occupy numerous offices, assembly and distribution facilities and warehouses in the United States and abroad.
1001250_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	We consider our properties to be generally in good condition and believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet anticipated requirements.
1001250_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	We lease approximately 741,000 square feet of rentable space for our principal offices in New York, New York.
1001250_16_ITEM2_P1_S3	We own a building of approximately 57,000 square feet of office space in Melville, New York.

1001250_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A Common Stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EL.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table shows the high and low per share sales prices as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015:
1001250_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	We expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future, but there can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will continue to declare them.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	On August 18, 2016, a dividend was declared in the amount of $.30 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	The dividend is payable in cash on September 15, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2016.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of August 18, 2016, there were 8,503 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 16 record holders of Class B Common Stock.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 216.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P3_S1	As of June 30, 2016, the cumulative total of acquired shares pursuant to the authorization was 197.5 million, reducing the remaining authorized share repurchase balance to 18.5 million.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P3_S2	During fiscal 2016, we purchased approximately 9.9 million shares pursuant to the authorization for $835.0 million as outlined in the following table:
1001250_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	(1) In November 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 40.0 million shares.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	(2) Includes shares that were repurchased by the Company in connection with shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of stock-based compensation.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	Subsequent to June 30, 2016 and as of August 18, 2016, we purchased approximately 2.2 million additional shares of our Class A Common Stock for $200.0 million pursuant to our share repurchase program.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	Shares of Class B Common Stock may be converted immediately into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis by the holder and are automatically converted into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis upon transfer to a person or entity that is not a Permitted Transferee or soon after a record date for a meeting of stockholders where the outstanding Class B Common Stock constitutes less than 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P6_S1	There is no cash or other consideration paid by the holder converting the shares and, accordingly, there is no cash or other consideration received by the Company.
1001250_16_ITEM5_P6_S2	The shares of Class A Common Stock issued by the Company in such conversions are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) thereof.

1001250_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The table below summarizes selected financial information.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto beginning on page F-1 of this report.

1001250_16_ITEM6_P1_S3	Fiscal 2012 results included $44.1 million, after tax, or $.11 per diluted share related to total charges associated with restructuring activities.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	(b) As a result of our July 2014 SMI rollout, approximately $178 million of accelerated orders were recorded as net sales and $127 million as operating income in fiscal 2014 that would have occurred in the fiscal 2015 first quarter, equal to approximately $.21 per diluted common share.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a $5.3 million charge, on a before and after tax basis, related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, equal to $.01 per diluted common share.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P3_S1	During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a $38.3 million charge, on a before and after tax basis, related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, equal to $.10 per diluted common share.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P4_S0	In May 2016, we issued $450.0 million of 1.70% Senior Notes due May 10, 2021 and an additional $150.0 million of our 4.375% Senior Notes due June 15, 2045.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P4_S1	In June 2015, we issued $300.0 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due June 15, 2045 in a public offering.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P4_S2	We are using the net proceeds of the offerings for general corporate purposes.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P4_S3	In September 2012, we redeemed the $230.1 million principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due November 1, 2013 ( 2013 Senior Notes ) at a price of 108% of the principal amount.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P4_S4	We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million ($12.2 million after tax, or $.03 per diluted share) representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P5_S0	In August 2012, we issued $250.0 million of 2.35% Senior Notes due August 15, 2022 and $250.0 million of 3.70% Senior Notes due August 15, 2042 in a public offering.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P5_S1	We used the net proceeds of the offering to redeem the 2013 Senior Notes and for general corporate purposes.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P6_S0	(e) For the year ended June 30, 2016, we retrospectively adopted new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
1001250_16_ITEM6_P6_S1	As a result, we restated the June 30, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 consolidated balance sheets to reclassify $12.4 million, $8.8 million, $9.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, from Other assets to Long-term debt.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2016 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1001250_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company s financial condition.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	This accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	Consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	Experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P4_S4	In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P4_S5	The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	For a discussion of our Revenue Recognition accounting policy, see Item 8.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
1001250_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	We believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	For further discussion of our Inventory accounting policy, see Item 8.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
1001250_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan ( U.S. Qualified Plan ) and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the Domestic Plans a domestic contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and future compensation levels.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	While we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	For fiscal 2016, net periodic benefit cost was determined using discount rates for our Domestic Plans of 4.40% and 3.70% and varying rates on our international plans between 0.75% and 7.00%.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	The discount rates for our Domestic Plans were based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	We used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	For our international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	For fiscal 2016, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of between 2.00% and 7.00% for our international plans.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 Pension, Deferred Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Plans for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	Those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	For fiscal 2016, our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $84 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $68 million.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	The resulting net deferred gain of approximately $16 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 8 to 19 years.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	The actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans was higher than expected, primarily due to strong performance of fixed income assets attributable to our international pension plan in the United Kingdom and the U.S. Qualified Plan, partially offset by equity underperformance globally.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	A 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2016 pension expense:
1001250_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	A 100 basis-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2016 would have had the following effects:
1001250_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	To determine the fiscal 2017 net periodic benefit cost, we are using discount rates of 3.70% and 3.00% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and the non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan, respectively, and varying rates for our international plans of between .25% and 6.00%.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	We are using an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 1.50% and 6.00%.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	The net change in these two key assumptions from those used in fiscal 2016 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $17 million in fiscal 2017.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	When testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	For fiscal 2016 and 2015, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for the majority of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	For those reporting units acquired in fiscal 2015, a quantitative assessment was performed.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P22_S4	We engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	For further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets, see Item 8.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
1001250_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	As of June 30, 2016, we have net deferred tax assets of $422.3 million.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of $118.4 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	For further discussion of our Income Taxes accounting policy, see Item 8.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
1001250_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	During the three-year period ended June 30, 2016, there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	The results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	A 250 basis-point change in the items above collectively would have had the following effects for fiscal 2016:
1001250_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Item 8.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 20 Segment Data and Related Information for all periods presented.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:
1001250_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 42 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	We calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	We believe the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with superior products and services in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers changing behaviors and shopping preferences.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	We are guided by our long-term strategy through fiscal 2019, which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	We plan to continue to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	We believe our range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumer s beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in mass distribution.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	Skin care, our most profitable product category historically, remains a strategic priority for us, and we continue to support our large, long-standing skin care product lines including Advanced Night Repair from Est e Lauder, Clinique s 3-Step Skin Care System and Cr me de la Mer from La Mer.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Serum Essence from La Mer.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	We supplemented our skin care offerings through the fiscal 2015 acquisitions of GLAMGLOW and RODIN olio lusso.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	While growth in global prestige skin care remained relatively slow in fiscal 2016, growth in global prestige makeup continued to show the fastest acceleration.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	This trend benefited our makeup sales, particularly in certain areas in Europe, the Middle East Africa, such as the United Kingdom.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	We also introduced new products, including new collections from our makeup artist brands and Smashbox, Double Wear Makeup to Go liquid compact and Pure Color Envy liquid lip potion from Est e Lauder, and Chubby Lash fattening mascara and Beyond Perfecting foundation + concealer from Clinique.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	We believe that the makeup category represents one of our most compelling growth opportunities.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	Our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of Jo Malone London and Tom Ford fragrances, new launches such as Mimosa Cardamom from Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Noir Pour Femme, and incremental net sales from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of Le Labo and Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	In addition, we are expanding our hair care brands in salons and other retail channels.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	To complement the strategies in our existing business, we are continuously looking to acquire and grow smaller brands that we believe have significant growth potential and may provide unique opportunities for profitable growth in the future.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P46_S4	During our fiscal 2016 third quarter, we further expanded our luxury fragrance portfolio with the acquisition of By Kilian, a prestige fragrance brand.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our global footprint provides many avenues of growth.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	We are leveraging our regional organizations and the talents and expertise of our people in an effort to continue to be locally relevant with our products, services, channels, marketing and visual merchandising.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	We are seeking share growth in large, image-building core markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan and Korea by strengthening our presence in these areas.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	This investment provides us with a strategic opportunity to participate in the expanding Korean beauty trend.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P47_S4	In addition, we are broadening our presence in emerging markets such as China, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico and South Africa.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P47_S5	While we continue to see slow department store traffic in some markets, which is particularly affecting Est e Lauder and Clinique, we are growing faster in other channels such as e- and m-commerce.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	In North America, we are hosting targeted in-store events to support key innovations in multiple channels, and we are increasing our presence in specialty multi-brand retailers and freestanding retail stores.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	Internationally, we are expanding our business in freestanding stores, in European perfumeries and pharmacies, and in department stores, particularly in the United Kingdom and certain markets in Asia.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	We approach distribution strategically by brand, as each is at a different stage of development.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	We seek to optimize distribution in both channels and geographies, matching each brand with appropriate opportunities.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	We focus on those areas where we believe our brands will expand consumer coverage and gain high-quality distribution consistent with their positioning.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P49_S3	As part of this strategy, we continue to expand brands in our travel retail channel, which benefits from increasing international passenger traffic.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P49_S4	Travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building and profit margin expansion, although it is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers willingness and ability to travel and spend.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	We have strategies focused on consumers who purchase in the travel retail channel, in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	This includes partnering with our retailers to open individual boutiques within airports to compete more effectively in this channel.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	We are broadening our online portfolio around the world by adding brands to existing markets and entering new markets, resulting in strong net sales growth in the online channel, and we continue to develop and test omnichannel concepts to better serve consumers as they shop across channels.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	We have identified opportunities to expand our online portfolio around the world, which we expect will result in continued net sales growth in this channel.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P50_S4	Our success in delivering particularly strong online growth in emerging markets is a result of taking key learnings from our online strategy in established markets, such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, and customizing them to meet local market needs.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P50_S5	To further drive our online sales, we are planning new e- and m-commerce site launches in new and existing markets, and we are extending our third-party platform model, which has been successful in China, into certain other international locations.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	While our business is performing well overall, we are faced with strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	In particular, we are cautious of the continued slow retail growth in Hong Kong, the decline in retail traffic primarily related to mid-tier department stores, as well as certain M A C freestanding stores, in the United States as a result of the impact of shifts in preferences of certain consumers as to where and how they shop for our products.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	We are also cautious of the continued strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	Additionally, we are continuing to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environment in Brazil, the United Kingdom s anticipated exit from the European Union, the political instability in Turkey, the impact of declining oil prices on consumer purchases in the Middle East, and global security issues.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	We believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas of strength, utilizing the various growth drivers among our brands, channels and markets.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	However, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged, then there could be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence, demand and spending and, as a result, on our business.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	We will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	We navigate through short-term volatility while focusing on our long-term strategy and using our multiple engines of growth that we believe will promote sustainable growth.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	We are increasing our presence in emerging markets, continuing efforts to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands, focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	We are also strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P53_S3	We will continue to drive product, packaging, and conceptual innovation and creativity that we believe will enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P53_S4	Some initiatives will involve new sub-categories and others may expand key franchises.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P53_S5	We expect to leverage our top line growth through greater productivity, due in part to cost savings and efficiencies from our Strategic Modernization Initiative ( SMI ).
1001250_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	On May 3, 2016, we announced a multi-year initiative ( Leading Beauty Forward ) to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	Leading Beauty Forward is designed to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	We plan to approve specific initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward through fiscal 2019 and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P54_S3	We expect that Leading Beauty Forward will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset write-offs and other costs to implement these initiatives.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P54_S4	After its full implementation, we expect Leading Beauty Forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P54_S5	We expect to reinvest a portion behind future growth initiatives.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P54_S6	For additional information about Leading Beauty Forward, see Item 8.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Charges Associated with Restructuring Activities .
1001250_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	In addition to Leading Beauty Forward, investment in our global information systems is an ongoing process.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	We have implemented initiatives to leverage our SMI foundation that are focused on sustainment and global efficiencies.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	As we modernize our key processes, related systems and infrastructure, we continue to develop upgraded capabilities to support our human resource operations and are making investments to upgrade our global technology infrastructure ( GTI ), as well as our retail systems and retail capabilities globally.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	These initiatives are expected to improve profitability by enhancing gross margin and supporting efficiencies in select operating expenses and working capital, freeing resources to strategically reinvest in activities to support our future growth.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	In October 2015, we approved plans to transform and modernize our GTI to fundamentally change the way we deliver information technology services internally (such initiative, the GTI Restructuring ).
1001250_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	As part of the GTI Restructuring, we transitioned our GTI from Company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where we pay for services as they are used.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	This model, with a different third-party provider, is expected to provide an enhanced scalable platform to better support current and future requirements, help us achieve key strategic opportunities and improve our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	This transition is expected to result in operational efficiencies and reduce our information technology service and infrastructure costs in the future.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P57_S4	The implementation of the GTI Restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P57_S5	Net savings from this initiative may be partially reinvested in other strategic areas of our business.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P57_S6	For additional information about the GTI Restructuring initiative, see Item 8.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P57_S7	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Charges Associated with Restructuring Activities .
1001250_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	We rolled out the last major wave of SMI in July 2014, and most of our locations are now SAP-enabled.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	We plan to continue the implementation of SAP at our remaining locations throughout the next few fiscal years.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	In connection with the July 2014 implementation, some retailers accelerated their sales orders that would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the SMI rollout.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P58_S3	The negative impact on the net sales and operating results for the year ended June 30, 2015 by product category and geographic region was as follows:
1001250_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	The lower orders during the year ended June 30, 2015 created a favorable comparison between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 of approximately $178 million in net sales and approximately $127 million in operating results and impacted our operating margin comparisons.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	We believe that the presentation of certain year-to-date comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 42 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.

1001250_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Reported net sales in fiscal 2016 grew in each product category, with the exception of skin care, and in each geographic region, with the exception of Asia/Pacific.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The overall decline in the skin care category was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the relatively slow growth in global prestige skin care that particularly impacted net sales in North America, Asia/Pacific and travel retail.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	However, this category benefited from increased sales of certain products, particularly from La Mer and Origins.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P62_S3	Net sales increases in product offerings by M A C, Smashbox, Tom Ford, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Est e Lauder globally drove the growth in the makeup category.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P62_S4	Our fragrance category benefited from net sales increases from our luxury brands.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P62_S5	Incremental sales from our acquisitions during the past two years also helped drive our skin care and fragrance sales.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P62_S6	The net sales increase in our hair care category was driven by product offerings from Aveda and Bumble and bumble, as well as expanded consumer coverage.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P62_S7	Each of our product categories benefited from brand expansion, comparable door sales growth from certain brands, new product offerings and growth from emerging markets.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Net sales in fiscal 2015 decreased from fiscal 2014, entirely driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $519 million and the difficult comparison due to the accelerated orders, as discussed above, of approximately $357 million.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	Inclusive of these items, higher net sales in our makeup and hair care product categories were more than offset by declines in our skin care and fragrance product categories, while geographically, we experienced lower net sales in each region.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	Our makeup artist and luxury brands continued to grow net sales through successful product launches and the broadening of their presence globally.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	However, net sales from Est e Lauder and Clinique were challenged in all of our product categories and reflected a difficult comparison to fiscal 2014, which featured significant launch activity related to the reformulation of certain iconic skin care products and several significant fragrance launches.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P63_S4	In addition, we experienced strong growth in certain channels such as specialty-multi, online and freestanding stores, as well as expansion in emerging markets.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P63_S5	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, net sales would have increased in each of our major product categories and within each geographic region.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Returns associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	Accordingly, the following discussions of Net Sales by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the fiscal 2016 impact of returns associated with restructuring activities of $1.4 million.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	______________________ (a) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 42 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Skin care net sales decreased in fiscal 2016, reflecting approximately $163 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $91 million.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	The reported net sales decrease reflected lower net sales from Est e Lauder and Clinique of approximately $138 million, combined.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	The decrease in net sales of Est e Lauder and Clinique products was due, in part, to lower sales in certain countries within Asia/Pacific, particularly Hong Kong reflecting continued retail softness.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P66_S3	The lower net sales from Clinique also reflected decreased sales in travel retail.

1001250_16_ITEM7_P114_S2	These higher results were partially offset by lower results in the United Kingdom, France and Russia of approximately $33 million.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P114_S3	The lower results in the United Kingdom were driven by the negative impact of foreign currency.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P114_S4	The lower results in France were partially due to higher investment spending behind certain of our heritage and luxury brands.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	Operating income in Europe, the Middle East Africa increased in fiscal 2015.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	Higher operating results in the United Kingdom, the Middle East, France, India, Russia and Switzerland of approximately $83 million, combined, were partially offset by lower operating results in our travel retail business, due to the accelerated orders, and, to a lesser extent, Germany of approximately $79 million, combined.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P115_S2	The higher results in France, India, Russia and Switzerland were primarily due to an increase in constant currency net sales.

1001250_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	In fiscal 2016, operating income increased in Asia/Pacific, reflecting the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	Excluding this impact, operating income decreased.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P117_S2	Lower results in Hong Kong and China totaled approximately $36 million, combined.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P117_S3	The decline in operating results in China was also attributable to higher selling and shipping costs.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P117_S4	These lower results were partially offset by higher results in Japan, driven by the impact of the accelerated orders, and, to a lesser extent, Australia, Korea and Taiwan of approximately $44 million, combined.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P117_S5	The improved results in Australia were due to higher sales from virtually all of our brands, as well as an improvement in selling and shipping costs.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P117_S6	The higher results in Korea were primarily due to lower advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P117_S7	The improved results from Taiwan were primarily due to an increase in net sales.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	In fiscal 2015, operating income in Asia/Pacific increased, primarily reflecting higher results in China, Korea and Australia of approximately $49 million, combined.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	These higher results were partially offset by lower results in Japan, due to the accelerated orders, and Singapore of approximately $40 million, combined.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	Interest expense increased in fiscal 2016, primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt in June 2015 and May 2016.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	Interest expense increased in fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher short- and long- term debt levels.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	Interest income and investment income, net increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015, primarily due to higher interest income as a result of an increase in short- and long-term investment balances and rates in connection with our cash investment strategy.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	The increase in fiscal 2015 also reflected realized gains on investments.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P120_S2	See Financial Condition below for further discussion of our modified cash investment strategy.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations, as well as a decrease in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in the current year.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations, which included Venezuela remeasurement charges in fiscal 2015 and 2014 of $5.3 million and $38.3 million, respectively, for which no tax benefit was provided.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	This reduction was partially offset by an increase in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in fiscal 2015.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P123_S1	The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P123_S2	Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P123_S3	In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.

1001250_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.

1001250_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P132_S1	At June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $914.1 million compared with $1,021.4 million at June 30, 2015.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P132_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P132_S3	To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from the prior year primarily reflects cash used to purchase short- and long-term investments pursuant to our cash investment strategy.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P133_S1	Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P133_S2	These investments are classified as available-for-sale and totaled $1,504.5 million and $917.8 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P134_S1	From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P134_S2	To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, restructuring activities, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P135_S1	Our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances at June 30, 2016 include approximately $2,002 million of cash and short- and long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P135_S2	We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P135_S3	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P137_S2	Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P138_S1	As of August 18, 2016, our commercial paper is rated A-1 by Standard Poor s and P-1 by Moody s and our long-term debt is rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard Poor s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody s.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) increased to 39% at June 30, 2016 from 31% at June 30, 2015, primarily due to the issuance of the $450.0 million of 1.70% Senior Notes due May 2021 ( 2021 Senior Notes ) and an additional $150.0 million of our 4.375% Senior Notes due June 2045 ( 2045 Senior Notes ).

1001250_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	The fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by the accelerated orders in connection with our July 2014 SMI implementation, which contributed to an unfavorable comparison in certain working capital components and the increase in net earnings.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P141_S1	The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities also reflected an unfavorable change in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and collections, and higher long-term payments related to new freestanding retail store locations, including cash payments made to former tenants to acquire the rights under commercial property leases.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P141_S2	Also contributing to the decrease was an unfavorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of expenses.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P141_S3	These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other accrued liabilities, due, in part, to higher accrued restructuring costs and employee incentive compensation.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P142_S0	The fiscal 2015 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected a favorable change in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and improved collections, a favorable change in inventory, reflecting our initiative to better align supply levels with forecasted demand and other supply chain improvements, and a favorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P142_S1	The accelerated orders in connection with our July 2014 SMI implementation also contributed to the favorable changes in these working capital components and the decrease in net earnings as compared to fiscal 2014.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P143_S0	The fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P143_S1	The decrease in cash used for investing activities also reflected lower payments related to acquisitions.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P143_S2	Cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2015 acquisitions was partially offset by cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2016 acquisition of By Kilian and an additional purchase price true-up payment related to a fiscal 2015 acquisition.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P144_S0	and Do The Right Thing, as well as higher capital expenditure activity, primarily related to leasehold improvements.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P145_S0	The fiscal 2015 increase in net cash used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected purchases of investments in connection with the implementation of our cash investment strategy, as previously discussed.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P145_S1	Also contributing to the increase was cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of RODIN olio lusso, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle and GLAMGLOW.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P146_S0	Partially offsetting cash used for investing activities were proceeds from the disposition of investments and, to a lesser extent, lower capital expenditure activity.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P147_S0	The fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes and additional 2045 Senior Notes, as well as lower treasury stock purchases, partially offset by higher dividend payments.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P148_S0	The fiscal 2015 increase in net cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases and higher dividend payments, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2045 Senior Notes.

1001250_16_ITEM7_P151_S0	Several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P151_S1	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P151_S2	For any future contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ( ERISA ) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P152_S0	For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P152_S1	In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in Item 7.

1001250_16_ITEM7_P153_S1	The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P154_S0	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P154_S1	This strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P154_S2	During fiscal 2016, we made a cash contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan of $30.0 million.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P154_S3	For fiscal 2016 and 2015, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under ERISA regulations for the U.S. Qualified Plan.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P154_S4	As we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the United States during fiscal 2017.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P155_S0	The following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and post-retirement plans:
1001250_16_ITEM7_P156_S0	Certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or earn-out provisions.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P156_S1	These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P156_S2	Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.

1001250_16_ITEM7_P167_S0	We use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P167_S1	Value-at-risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P167_S2	We estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250-day period.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P167_S3	The high, low and average measured value-at-risk during fiscal 2016 and 2015 related to our derivative financial instruments is as follows:
1001250_16_ITEM7_P168_S0	The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P169_S0	We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P169_S1	Our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P169_S2	It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P170_S0	Value-at-risk during fiscal 2016 was higher than fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher volatility in foreign exchange rates.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P170_S1	We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
1001250_16_ITEM7_P171_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

1001250_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	This enables us to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new customers, build loyalty, drive consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors.
1001250_17_ITEM1_P23_S3	Our marketing planning approach leverages local insights to optimize allocation of resources across different media outlets and retail touch points to resonate with our most discerning consumers most effectively.
1001250_17_ITEM1_P23_S4	This includes strategically deploying our brands and tailoring product assortments and communications to fit local tastes and preferences in cities and neighborhoods.
1001250_17_ITEM1_P23_S5	Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house teams that design and produce the sales materials, social media strategies, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand.
1001250_17_ITEM1_P23_S6	We build brand equity and drive traffic to retail locations and to our own and authorized retailers websites through digital and social media, magazines and newspapers, television, billboards in cities and airports, and direct mail and email.

1001250_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as sampling programs, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase, and we continue to believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers.

1001250_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Many elements of our global information technology infrastructure are managed by third-party providers under vendor-owned, cloud-based models where we pay for services as they are consumed.

1001250_17_ITEM1_P34_S4	While we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and third-party manufacturers is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity, technology, and productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand.

1001250_17_ITEM1_P36_S6	In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.

1001250_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading prices of our securities, may be adversely affected.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and others are newer companies (some backed by private-equity investors) competing in distribution channels where we are less represented.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In some cases, our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Competition in the beauty business is based on a variety of factors including pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors actions in these areas.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our Company has a well-recognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by many factors.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	If our reputation is adversely affected, our ability to attract and retain customers and consumers could be impacted.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In addition, certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We must continually work to develop, manufacture and market new products, maintain and adapt our High-Touch services to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, successfully manage our inventories, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	The issue is compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	If we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our financial results will suffer.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P5_S6	In addition, from time to time, sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands, channels or countries.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P5_S7	If such a situation persists or a number of brands, channels or countries fail to perform as expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In key markets, such as the United States, we have seen a decline in retail traffic in our department store customers and certain of our freestanding stores.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	and m-commerce platforms (both in mass and prestige distribution) that are impacting our business.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Further consolidation in the retail trade, from these or other factors, may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	This could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	A severe, adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If one or more of our largest customers change their strategies (including pricing or promotional activities) or they or we change or terminate their relationship with us, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Achieving our long-term strategy will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	These investments may result in short-term costs without any current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings, at least in the short term.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We continuously review acquisition and strategic investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If required, the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future, a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results, then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks, which may include:
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from, or customers of, acquired businesses; diversion of management s attention from our existing businesses; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business; and risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business or to achieve the long-term plan for such business, as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition and investment activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	A general economic downturn, or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P15_S8	If a retailer was to liquidate, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer s inventory of our products to protect brand equity.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, from events such as a pandemic, or other local or global health issues, conflicts around the world, or as a result of a terrorist attack, retaliation or similar threats, or as a result of adverse weather conditions, climate changes or seismic events, can have a short-term and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Events that impact consumers willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business, including travel retail, a significant contributor to our overall results, and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A downturn in the economies of, or continuing recessions in, the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence, the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to brick-and-mortar department stores in the United States as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We are also cautious of foreign currency movements and their impact on tourism, which has particularly impacted certain tourist-driven stores in the United States.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as Brazil and in the Middle East, the United Kingdom s anticipated exit from the European Union, geopolitical tensions and global security issues.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	While we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements, such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect, or will affect, our business, including changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, laws and regulations relating to data privacy, anti-corruption, advertising, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, product registration, ingredients, chemicals and packaging, laws in Europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are involved, and may become involved in the future, in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that, if adversely decided or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, other disputes or regulatory proceedings.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In general, claims made by us or against us in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	As we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways, including the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, our product claims are found to be deceptive, or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers expectations, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and/or become subject to liability or claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, third parties may sell counterfeit versions of some of our products.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P25_S4	These counterfeit products may pose safety risks, may fail to meet consumers expectations, and may have a negative impact on our reputation.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our key personnel.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Competition for these employees can be intense.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are subject to risks related to the global scope of our operations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We operate on a global basis, with a majority of our fiscal 2017 net sales and operating income generated outside the United States.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We intend to reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations indefinitely, except where we are able to repatriate these earnings to the United States without material incremental tax provision.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	A majority of our cash and cash equivalents that result from these earnings remain outside the United States.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located inside and outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our global operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	adverse weather conditions, currency exchange controls, and social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	A disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Some of our products rely on single or a limited number of suppliers.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Further, the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities, in compliance with applicable standards, and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P32_S4	In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our information systems and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches, outages, and other risks.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We rely on information systems (outsourced and in-house) that support our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We have e-commerce, m-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and other events.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P33_S5	The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information systems and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain information that is confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive, including personal information with respect to customers, consumers and employees.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Moreover, the success of our e-commerce and m-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and personal information, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees , consumers and customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P35_S5	In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are subject to risks associated with our global information systems.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our implementation and maintenance of global information systems (outsourced and in-house), including supply chain and finance systems, human resource management systems, creative asset management and retail operating systems, as well as associated hardware and use of cloud-based models, involve risks and uncertainties.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Failure to implement and maintain these and other systems as planned, in terms of timing, specifications, costs, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	As we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	As part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	These include certain information systems, finance and human resource functions.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In addition, if we transition systems to one or more new, or among existing, external service providers, we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal 2017, we provided guidance as to certain assumptions, including ranges for our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2017 and the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P39_S5	While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P39_S6	In addition, the longer-term guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	At any time, we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program, and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our net sales and/or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q).
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our financial results for any future period.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P42_S5	We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are controlled by the Lauder family.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	As a result of their control of us, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	As of August 18, 2017, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having approximately 87% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In addition, there are four members of the Lauder family who are employees and members of our Board of Directors.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Another family member is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	As a result of the stock ownership and their positions at the Company, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets, for the foreseeable future.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a controlled company under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	As a controlled company, we are exempt under the New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that (1) a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; (2) we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities; and (3) we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	While we have voluntarily caused our Board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and the Compensation Committee to have the required provisions, we are not requiring our Nominating and Board Affairs Committee and Compensation Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors.
1001250_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As a result of our use of the controlled company exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.
1001250_17_ITEM1B_P0_S0	As of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, there were no unresolved comments from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1001250_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following table sets forth our principal owned and leased manufacturing, assembly, research and development and distribution facilities, some of which include contiguous office space, as of August 18, 2017.
1001250_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	The leases expire at various times through 2026 subject to certain renewal options.
1001250_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own, lease and occupy numerous offices, assembly and distribution facilities and warehouses in the United States and abroad.
1001250_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	We consider our properties to be generally in good condition and believe that our facilities are adequate for our operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet anticipated requirements.
1001250_17_ITEM2_P1_S2	We lease approximately 767,000 square feet of rentable space for our principal offices in New York, New York.
1001250_17_ITEM2_P1_S3	We own a building of approximately 57,000 square feet of office space in Melville, New York.
1001250_17_ITEM2_P1_S4	As of June 30, 2017, we directly leased and operated approximately 1,430 freestanding stores.
1001250_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Item 8.
1001250_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies.
1001250_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our Class A Common Stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EL.
1001250_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table shows the high and low per share sales prices as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape and the cash dividends per share declared in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016:
1001250_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	We expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future, but there can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will continue to declare them.
1001250_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	On August 17, 2017, a dividend was declared in the amount of $.34 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock.
1001250_17_ITEM5_P1_S2	The dividend is payable in cash on September 15, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2017.
1001250_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of August 18, 2017, there were 8,080 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 15 record holders of Class B Common Stock.
1001250_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors.
1001250_17_ITEM5_P3_S1	The following table provides information relating to our repurchase of Class A Common Stock during the referenced periods:
1001250_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	(1) Includes shares that were repurchased by the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon the payout of certain stock-based compensation arrangements.
1001250_17_ITEM5_P4_S1	(2) The current repurchase program for up to 40.0 million shares was authorized by the Board of Directors on November 1, 2012.
1001250_17_ITEM5_P4_S2	Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
1001250_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	Subsequent to June 30, 2017 and as of August 18, 2017, we purchased approximately 0.5 million additional shares of our Class A Common Stock for $45 million pursuant to our share repurchase program.
1001250_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	The table below summarizes selected financial information.

1001250_17_ITEM6_P9_S1	The deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance related to the accumulated carryforward of excess advertising and promotional expenses.
1001250_17_ITEM6_P9_S2	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a favorable change to the tax law in China was enacted that expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses, resulting in this change in realizability of the asset.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Item 8.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 21 Segment Data and Related Information for all periods presented.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:
1001250_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 41 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	We calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We believe the best way to increase stockholder value is to continue to provide superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing consumers changing behaviors and shopping preferences.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	We are guided by our long-term strategy, which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	We plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our balanced, diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty .
1001250_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	We believe that our range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumer s beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in mass-market distribution.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our skin care product category benefits from hero product lines such as Advanced Night Repair from Est e Lauder and Cr me de La Mer from La Mer.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	During fiscal 2017, we continued to expand these product lines through the introduction of the Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix from Est e Lauder and the Revitalizing Hydrating Serum from La Mer.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	GLAMGLOW also contributed to the success in the category through targeted expanded consumer reach and new launches such as Plumprageous.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we purchased a minority interest in DECIEM, a skin care brand, which provides us with a strategic investment in a company that attracts millennials and a diverse consumer base.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	In our makeup category, we further developed hero product lines such as Double Wear and Pure Color Envy from Est e Lauder through the launch of additional products including Double Wear Nude Cushion Stick Radiant Makeup and Pure Color Envy Hi-Lustre Light Sculpting Lipstick.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	We continuously look to acquire brands that complement our existing business, have significant sales growth potential and provide opportunities for future profitable growth.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	During our fiscal 2017 second quarter, we expanded our makeup portfolio with the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	Both of these brands are primarily distributed in the faster growing specialty-multi and online channels.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	They are expected to help us reach new consumers, to increase our sales in these channels and to continue generating strong profitable growth.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of Jo Malone London and Tom Ford fragrances, as well as from our fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 acquisitions.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	We have also benefited from the growth of the fragrance category in the Asia/Pacific region and look for further opportunities to strengthen our business in this category there.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	In our hair care category, we are reaching new consumers as we expand our presence beyond salons, such as the planned September 2017 launch of Bumble and bumble in Ulta Beauty, a leading specialty-multi retailer in the United States.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our global footprint provides many avenues of growth.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	We leverage our regional organizations and the talents and expertise of our people to continue to be locally relevant through evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores, online and where they travel.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	This includes the expansion of our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	We tailor our strategy by country with our products, services, channels, marketing and visual merchandising.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P17_S4	We continuously strengthen our presence in large, image-building core markets, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, and broaden our presence in emerging markets, including the Middle East, Russia, South Africa and Brazil.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	In North America, we continue to deploy a number of strategies to accelerate growth, despite a challenging environment especially in brick and mortar department stores, and in Latin America we continue to launch new brands, expand the integration of social media and gain share in prestige beauty by encouraging consumers to trade up from mass-market products.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, we are expanding our digital and social media presence as well as leveraging our makeup strength to gain share in prestige beauty.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	In Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, we are leveraging our diversified brand portfolio to benefit from the growth of the makeup and fragrance categories as well as continuing to launch new skin care products such as the Clinique Fresh Pressed line of products with Vitamin C.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	We approach distribution strategically by brand, distribution channel and product category.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	We are adding brands to faster growing channels, such as e- and m-commerce and specialty multi-brand retailers, and we are expanding certain brands into geographic markets where they are not yet sold.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	In fiscal 2017, we increased our penetration in the specialty-multi channel through the acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced, and we expanded the representation of our existing brands, such as the launch of M A C in Ulta Beauty.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition, we have opportunities to accelerate our growth within specialty-multi brand retailers as they open new doors.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Internationally, we are expanding our business in freestanding retail stores operated by us and by authorized third parties, in European perfumeries and pharmacies, and in department stores, particularly in the United Kingdom and certain markets in Asia.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	We seek to optimize distribution in both channels and geographies, matching each brand with appropriate opportunities while maintaining high productivity per door.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	We focus on brand-building retail opportunities that will expand consumer coverage for our brands.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	As part of this strategy, we continue to diversify our business in our travel retail channel across brands and product categories.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	Travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building and profit margin expansion.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P24_S4	At the same time it is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers willingness and ability to travel and spend.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Online net sales continue to grow strongly on a global basis and we are continuing to launch e- and m-commerce sites in new and existing markets.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	We are also partnering with our retailers globally to drive sales of our products on their online sites.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	We believe our success in delivering particularly strong online growth is a result of customization of our strategy to meet local market needs.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	We also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	While our business is performing well overall, we continue to face strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	In particular, we are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to brick-and-mortar department stores in the United States as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	We are also cautious of foreign currency movements, including their impact on tourism, which has particularly impacted certain tourist-driven stores in the United States.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	Additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as Brazil and in the Middle East, the United Kingdom s anticipated exit from the European Union, geopolitical tensions and global security issues.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	We believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas of strength among our brands, product categories, channels and markets.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	However, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged, there could be a negative effect on consumer confidence, demand and spending and, as a result, on our business.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	We will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	We navigate through short-term volatility while focusing on our long-term strategy and using our multiple engines of growth that we believe will help promote sustainable results.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	We are increasing our presence in emerging markets, continuing efforts to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands, focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	We are also strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	We will continue to drive product, packaging, and conceptual innovation and creativity that we believe enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	Some initiatives will involve new sub-categories and others may expand key franchises.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	In May 2016, we announced a multi-year initiative ( Leading Beauty Forward ) to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Leading Beauty Forward is designed to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	We plan to approve specific initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	Inclusive of charges recorded from inception through June 30, 2017, we expect that Leading Beauty Forward will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset write-offs and other costs to implement these initiatives.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	After its full implementation, we expect Leading Beauty Forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in Selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	We expect to reinvest a portion of these savings in future growth initiatives.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P29_S6	For additional information about Leading Beauty Forward, see Item 8.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities .
1001250_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	In October 2015, we approved plans to transform and modernize our global technology infrastructure ( GTI ) to fundamentally change the way we deliver information technology services internally (such initiative, the GTI Restructuring ).
1001250_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	As part of the GTI Restructuring, we transitioned our GTI from Company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where we pay for services as they are used.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	The implementation of the GTI Restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	For additional information about the GTI restructuring, see Item 8.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	We rolled out the last major wave of our Strategic Modernization Initiative ( SMI ) in July 2014, and most of our locations are now SAP-enabled.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	We plan to continue the implementation of SAP at our remaining locations throughout the next few fiscal years.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	In connection with the July 2014 implementation, some retailers accelerated their sales orders that would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the SMI rollout.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	The negative impact on the net sales and operating results for the year ended June 30, 2015 by product category and geographic region was as follows:
1001250_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	The lower orders during the year ended June 30, 2015 created a favorable comparison between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 of approximately $178 million in net sales and approximately $127 million in operating results and impacted our operating margin comparisons.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	We believe that the presentation of certain year-to-date comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Fr d ric Malle reporting units exceeded their fair values.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	This determination was made based on updated long-term plans, finalized and approved in June 2017, that reflected lower sales growth projections due to a softer than expected retail environment for those brands.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	As a result, a Step 2 impairment assessment was performed and we recorded an impairment charge of the goodwill related to these reporting units of $28 million.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P35_S4	The fair values of the reporting units were based upon the average of the income approach, which utilizes estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows, and the market approach, which utilizes performance multiples based on market peers.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P35_S5	As of June 30, 2017, no goodwill remained related to the RODIN olio lusso reporting unit and the remaining carrying value of the goodwill related to the Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle reporting unit was $6 million.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	We also determined that the carrying values of the RODIN olio lusso and Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle trademarks, as well as the RODIN olio lusso persona and customer relationship intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	The fair values of the trademarks were determined utilizing a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	As a result, we recognized impairment charges of $3 million for the remaining carrying values of the RODIN olio lusso trademark, customer relationship and persona intangible assets.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	We also recognized an impairment charge for the Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle trademark, which was de minimis.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P36_S4	The remaining carrying value of this trademark was $32 million as of June 30, 2017.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	The combined goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $9 million and $22 million are reflected in the skin care and fragrance product categories, respectively, and $17 million and $14 million are reflected in the Americas and Europe, the Middle East Africa regions, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	If the softness in the retail environment impacting our growth projections for the Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle reporting unit is more severe than we have anticipated, or other business disruptions arise, a resulting change in the long-term plans could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of the related goodwill and trademark and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	Based on the latest quantitative assessment, the fair values of all other reporting units with material goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, with the exception of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	With regard to Too Faced and BECCA, the carrying values of the related goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the assessment date approximated their fair values.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	(a) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 41 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	The fiscal 2015 impact of accelerated orders only impacted the comparison of fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Reported net sales in fiscal 2017 increased in each major product category, except hair care, and grew in each geographic region.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	Skin care net sales primarily benefited from higher sales of La Mer products.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Incremental net sales from our fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, as well as net sales increases from Tom Ford, Est e Lauder and Smashbox, drove growth in the makeup product category.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	Our fragrance category primarily benefited from net sales increases from Jo Malone London.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	Increased net sales from our fiscal 2016 and 2015 acquisitions of GLAMGLOW, By Kilian, Le Labo and Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle, also contributed to growth in our skin care and fragrance categories.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P41_S5	The net sales decrease in our hair care category primarily reflected a difficult comparison with the prior-year period that featured greater launch activity.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P41_S6	Each of our product categories benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach, new product offerings and growth from emerging markets and in the specialty-multi and online channels.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Reported net sales in fiscal 2016 grew in each product category, with the exception of skin care, and in each geographic region, with the exception of Asia/Pacific.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	The overall decline in the skin care category was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the relatively slow growth in global prestige skin care that particularly impacted net sales in North America, Asia/Pacific and travel retail.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	However, this category benefited from increased sales of certain products, particularly from La Mer and Origins.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	Net sales increases in product offerings by M A C, Smashbox, Tom Ford, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Est e Lauder globally drove the growth in the makeup category.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	Our fragrance category benefited from net sales increases from our luxury brands.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P42_S5	Incremental sales from our acquisitions during fiscal 2016 and 2015 also helped drive our skin care and fragrance sales.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P42_S6	The net sales increase in our hair care category was driven by product offerings from Aveda and Bumble and bumble, as well as expanded consumer coverage.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P42_S7	Each of our product categories benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach, comparable door sales growth from certain brands, new product offerings and growth from emerging markets.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	The reported net sales increases were adversely affected by approximately $187 million and $488 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Returns associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Accordingly, the following discussions of Net Sales by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the fiscal 2017 and 2016 impact of returns associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately $2 million and $1 million, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	(a) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 41 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	The fiscal 2015 impact of accelerated orders only impacted the comparison of fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Reported skin care net sales increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting higher net sales from La Mer, GLAMGLOW, Est e Lauder, Bobbi Brown and Origins of approximately $157 million, combined, partially offset by lower net sales from Clinique and M A C of approximately $93 million, combined.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	Higher net sales from La Mer were primarily due to targeted expanded consumer reach in the Americas region and in our travel retail business, and the increase in net sales from GLAMGLOW reflected incremental sales from additional product assortments and targeted expanded consumer reach.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	Higher net sales from Est e Lauder were partially due to net sales growth in our travel retail business and in China resulting from higher net sales of the Advanced Night Repair and Revitalizing Supreme lines of products.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	Net sales growth from Bobbi Brown was driven by new launches including Instant Confidence Stick and Extra Repair Nourishing Milk.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P47_S4	The higher net sales from Origins reflected net sales growth in the Asia/Pacific region and in our travel retail business resulting from higher net sales of toners and facial masks.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	The lower net sales of Clinique products primarily reflected a soft retail environment for our products, particularly in our travel retail business, Asia/Pacific and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom and brick-and-mortar department stores in the United States.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	The lower net sales from M A C were driven by slower retail traffic in brick-and-mortar stores in the United States reflecting the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	The net sales increase for skin care was adversely affected by approximately $60 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Reported skin care net sales decreased in fiscal 2016, reflecting approximately $163 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $91 million.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	The reported net sales decrease reflected lower net sales from Est e Lauder and Clinique of approximately $138 million, combined.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	The decrease in net sales of Est e Lauder and Clinique products was due, in part, to lower sales in certain countries within Asia/Pacific, particularly Hong Kong reflecting continued retail softness.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	The lower net sales from Clinique also reflected decreased sales in travel retail.

1001250_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	Partially offsetting this decrease was the favorable year-over-year net impact of $26 million due to the changes in fair value of contingent consideration partially offset by the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2017, as previously discussed, as well as disciplined expense management by certain of our heritage brands.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	Reported operating income in the Americas increased in fiscal 2016, reflecting the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of $106 million.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	Excluding the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income decreased, primarily reflecting an increase in advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses related to M A C in-store promotional events and certain of our luxury brands, as well as higher store operating and selling costs as a result of increased distribution.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P113_S2	Operating income was impacted by a decline in retail traffic in the United States related primarily to mid-tier department stores that primarily affected Est e Lauder and Clinique, as well as certain M A C freestanding stores, as a result of a decrease in tourism, particularly from Brazilian travelers.

1001250_17_ITEM7_P121_S3	The decline in operating results in China was also attributable to higher selling and shipping costs.

1001250_17_ITEM7_P121_S5	The improved results in Australia were due to higher sales from virtually all of our brands, as well as an improvement in selling and shipping costs.

1001250_17_ITEM7_P123_S1	See Financial Condition for further discussion of our modified cash investment strategy.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 decreased approximately 460 basis points due to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance (the China deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal ).
1001250_17_ITEM7_P124_S1	The deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance related to the accumulated carryforward of excess advertising and promotional expenses.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P124_S2	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a favorable change to the tax law in China was enacted that expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses, resulting in this change in realizability of the asset.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P124_S3	Also contributing to this decrease was a reduction in income tax reserve adjustments of approximately 100 basis points.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations, as well as a decrease in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in fiscal 2016.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P126_S1	The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P126_S2	Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P126_S3	In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.

1001250_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P140_S1	At June 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,136 million compared with $914 million at June 30, 2016.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P140_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P140_S3	To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	In addition, we purchase short and long-term investments pursuant to our cash investment strategy.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P141_S1	Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P141_S2	These investments are classified as available-for-sale and totaled $1,498 million and $1,505 million at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P142_S1	From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P142_S2	To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P143_S1	Our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances at June 30, 2017 include $2,376 million of cash and short- and long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P143_S2	We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P143_S3	If these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P144_S1	Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P145_S1	Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P145_S2	Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.

1001250_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	The fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, a decrease in discretionary pension and post-retirement benefit contributions and a favorable change in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments and collections.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P150_S1	These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments, and other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, related to a change in legal accruals, accrued professional fees and accrued employee incentive compensation, partially offset by advertising and promotional accruals.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	The overall change in cash flows from certain working capital components was impacted by our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	The fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by the accelerated orders in connection with our July 2014 SMI implementation, which contributed to an unfavorable comparison in certain working capital components and the increase in net earnings.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P152_S1	The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities also reflected an unfavorable change in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and collections, and higher long-term payments related to new freestanding retail store locations, including cash payments made to former tenants to acquire the rights under commercial property leases.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P152_S2	Also contributing to the decrease was an unfavorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of expenses.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P152_S3	These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other accrued liabilities, due, in part, to higher accrued restructuring costs and employee incentive compensation.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	The fiscal 2017 increase in net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, partially offset by lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	The fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P154_S1	The decrease in cash used for investing activities also reflected lower payments related to acquisitions.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P154_S2	Cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2015 acquisitions was partially offset by cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2016 acquisition of By Kilian and an additional purchase price true-up payment related to a fiscal 2015 acquisition.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	and Do The Right Thing, as well as higher capital expenditure activity, primarily related to leasehold improvements.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	The fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by financing activities reflected the issuance of the 2020 Senior Notes, 2027 Senior Notes and 2047 Senior Notes, partially offset by the repayment of the 5.55% Senior Notes due May 15, 2017.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P156_S1	The increase also reflected lower treasury stock purchases and higher commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by higher dividend payments.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P157_S0	The fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 1.70% Senior Notes due May 10, 2021 and additional 4.375% Senior Notes due June 15, 2045, as well as lower treasury stock purchases, partially offset by higher dividend payments.

1001250_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	Several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P160_S1	For our domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan ( U.S. Qualified Plan ), we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P160_S2	For any future contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ( ERISA ) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P161_S0	For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P161_S1	In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P161_S2	The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P162_S0	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P162_S1	This strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P162_S2	For fiscal 2017 and 2016, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under ERISA regulations for the U.S. Qualified Plan.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P162_S3	In fiscal 2016, we made a discretionary cash contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan of $30 million.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P162_S4	As we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the United States during fiscal 2018.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	The following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and post-retirement plans:
1001250_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	Certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or earn-out provisions.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P164_S1	These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P164_S2	Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.

1001250_17_ITEM7_P175_S1	This sensitivity analysis utilizes hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates at the end of the reporting period to express the potential future losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P175_S2	We believe this model provides greater insight into the impact of market risk exposures on our derivative instruments.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P176_S0	We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P176_S1	To perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P176_S2	A hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $26 million and $22 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P176_S3	This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P177_S0	In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P177_S1	Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by $34 million and $15 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P178_S0	Our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P178_S1	It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P178_S2	We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P179_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P180_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P181_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2017 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1001250_17_ITEM7_P181_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P181_S2	These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P182_S0	We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company s financial condition.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P183_S0	Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P184_S0	Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P185_S0	Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P185_S1	This accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P185_S2	Consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P185_S3	Experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P185_S4	In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P185_S5	The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P186_S0	For a discussion of our Revenue Recognition accounting policy, which includes information about the sales return accrual, see Item 8.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P187_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
1001250_17_ITEM7_P188_S0	Inventory We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P188_S1	We believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P188_S2	The reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P189_S0	We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P189_S1	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P189_S2	In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P190_S0	For further discussion of our Inventory accounting policy, see Item 8.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P191_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
1001250_17_ITEM7_P192_S0	Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Costs We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: the U.S. Qualified Plan and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the Domestic Plans a domestic contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P193_S0	The amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and future compensation levels.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P193_S1	We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P193_S2	While we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P194_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P194_S1	For fiscal 2017, net periodic benefit cost was determined using discount rates for our Domestic Plans of 3.70% and 3.00% and varying rates on our international plans between .25% and 6.00%.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P194_S2	The discount rates for our Domestic Plans were based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P194_S3	We used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our Domestic Plans.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P194_S4	For our international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P195_S0	For fiscal 2017, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of between 1.50% and 6.00% for our international plans.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P196_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P197_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 14 Pension, Deferred Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Plans for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P198_S0	The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P198_S1	Those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P199_S0	For fiscal 2017, our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $99 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $68 million.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P199_S1	The resulting net deferred gain of approximately $31 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 19 years.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P199_S2	The actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans was higher than expected due to the strong performance of equity assets globally and enhanced by fixed income returns in the United Kingdom plan.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P199_S3	A 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2017 pension expense:
1001250_17_ITEM7_P200_S0	Our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P200_S1	A 100 basis-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2017 would have had the following effects:
1001250_17_ITEM7_P201_S0	To determine the fiscal 2018 net periodic benefit cost, we are using discount rates of 3.90% and 3.40% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and the non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan, respectively, and varying rates for our international plans of between .50% and 6.75%.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P201_S1	We are using an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 1.75% and 6.75%.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P201_S2	The net change in these two key assumptions from those used in fiscal 2017 will result in a decrease in pension expense of approximately $1 million in fiscal 2018.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P202_S0	Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P202_S1	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P202_S2	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P203_S0	When testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P203_S1	For fiscal 2017 and 2016, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P203_S2	This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P203_S3	For our other reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those acquired during and subsequent to fiscal 2015, a quantitative assessment was performed.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P203_S4	We engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P203_S5	With regard to our fiscal 2017 acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced, the carrying values of the related goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the assessment date approximated their fair values.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P204_S0	For further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets, see Item 8.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P205_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
1001250_17_ITEM7_P206_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P206_S1	As of June 30, 2017, we have net deferred tax assets of $322 million.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P206_S2	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P206_S3	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of $42 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P207_S0	We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P207_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P207_S2	We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P208_S0	For further discussion of our Income Taxes accounting policy, see Item 8.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P209_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
1001250_17_ITEM7_P210_S0	Quantitative Analysis During the three-year period ended June 30, 2017, there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P210_S1	The results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P211_S0	While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P212_S0	A 250 basis-point change in the items above collectively would have had the following effects for fiscal 2017:
1001250_17_ITEM7_P213_S0	Net earnings attributable to The Est e Lauder Companies Inc.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P214_S0	We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P214_S1	The words and phrases will likely result, expect, believe, planned, may, should, could, anticipate, estimate, project, intend, forecast or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P214_S2	These statements include, our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale, our long-term strategy, restructuring and other charges and resulting cost savings, and future operations or operating results.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P214_S3	Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P214_S4	Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include:
1001250_17_ITEM7_P215_S0	(18) additional factors as described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.
1001250_17_ITEM7_P216_S0	We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements made herein or otherwise.

1001250_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this item appears beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
1001250_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
1001250_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and the Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2017 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.
1001250_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change management over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the Company s financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting.
1001250_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	During fiscal 2017, we implemented our previously-disclosed remediation plan that included: (i) improving general information technology program change control activities and policies, including processes to maintain sufficient documentation evidencing execution of these policies; (ii) improving the control activities and procedures associated with user access to certain information technology systems, including proper segregation of duties related to the affected information systems; (iii) educating and re-training control owners regarding internal control processes to mitigate identified risks and maintaining adequate documentation to evidence the effective design and operation of such processes; and (iv) implementing enhanced controls to monitor the effectiveness of the underlying business process controls that are dependent on the data and financial reports generated from the relevant information systems.
1001250_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and found them to be effective.
1001250_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	As a result, we have concluded that the material weakness has been remediated as of June 30, 2017.
1001250_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Except for the changes in connection with our implementation of the remediation plan discussed above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P20_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P21_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	Under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P22_S1	Based on this assessment, the Company s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2017, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under the heading Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P25_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P25_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P26_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P26_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P28_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	In our opinion, The Est e Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

1001250_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, and income taxes.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P52_S1	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P52_S2	Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange for the period.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	For the Company s Venezuelan and Ukrainian subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P56_S1	Accordingly, the Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange gains on foreign currency transactions of $15 million, $16 million and $4 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	These investments are classified as available-for-sale, with any temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an investment presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ).

1001250_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	Investments in the common stock of privately-held companies in which the Company has significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Company accounts for all other investments using the cost-method of accounting.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P61_S2	These investments were not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 and are included in Long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss positions for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P62_S1	Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P62_S2	Factors considered by the Company include, but are not limited to (i) the length of time and extent the security has been in a material loss position; (ii) the financial condition and creditworthiness of the issuer; (iii) future economic conditions and market forecasts related to the issuer s industry, sector, or geography; (iv) the Company s intent and ability to retain its investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value; and (v) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of market value.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	Accounts receivable is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions totaling $30 million and $24 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P63_S1	This reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific exposures and historical trends.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	Inventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P64_S1	Cost components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as inbound freight.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P64_S2	M anufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity .
1001250_17_ITEM15_P64_S3	Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P65_S0	Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company s customers.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P65_S1	Included in inventory and promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P65_S2	This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P65_S3	In addition, and as necessary, specific reserves for future known or anticipated events may be established.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ( fair-value hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash-flow hedge), or (iii) not designated as a hedging instrument.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P66_S2	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge that is highly effective are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments).
1001250_17_ITEM15_P66_S3	Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash-flow hedge of a forecasted transaction that is highly effective are recorded in OCI.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P66_S4	Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).
1001250_17_ITEM15_P66_S5	Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P72_S1	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P74_S1	The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company s operating segments.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P74_S2	The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P74_S3	The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P74_S4	When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P74_S5	If necessary, the quantitative impairment test is performed in two steps: (i) the Company determines if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P74_S6	When testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company also has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P75_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	For fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying value.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P76_S2	The Company considered macroeconomic factors including the global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible assets are employed, and the growth of the global prestige beauty industry.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P76_S3	In addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, the Company considered the reporting units current results and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business climate factors, changes in the industry/competitive environment, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and its intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of a trademark.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	For the Company s other reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those acquired during and subsequent to fiscal 2015, a quantitative assessment was performed.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P77_S1	The Company engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P77_S2	To determine the fair value of the reporting units, the Company used an equal weighting of the income and market approaches.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	Under the income approach, we determined fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflected the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P78_S1	Under the market approach, we utilized market multiples from publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P78_S2	The key estimates and factors used in these two approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P79_S0	To determine the fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we use an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P79_S1	This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P80_S1	When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P80_S2	If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P81_S1	The Company s sales that are subject to credit risk are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries, specialty multi-brand retailers and retailers in its travel retail business.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P81_S2	The Company grants credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company s largest customer sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for $922 million, or 8%, $1,065 million, or 9%, and $1,060 million, or 10%, of the Company s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P82_S1	This customer accounted for $112 million, or 8%, and $164 million, or 13%, of the Company s accounts receivable at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P84_S0	Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P84_S1	In the Americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P84_S2	In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at the Company s retail stores.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company records revenues generated from purchase with purchase promotions in Net Sales and costs of its purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions in Cost of Sales.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P86_S0	Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Company s practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested and approved.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P86_S2	In accepting returns, the Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P86_S3	As a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.5% in fiscal 2017, 3.1% in fiscal 2016 and 3.4% in fiscal 2015.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	Certain incentive arrangements require the payment of a fee to customers based on their attainment of pre-established sales levels.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P87_S1	These fees have been accrued and recorded as a reduction of Net Sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were not material to the results of operations in any period presented.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company enters into transactions related to demonstration, advertising and counter construction, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P88_S1	These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P88_S2	To the extent the Company receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for consideration and the fair-value of the benefit can be reasonably estimated, the Company s share of the counter depreciation and the other costs of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were approximately $1,405 million, $1,387 million and $1,378 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P89_S0	Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development were $2,908 million, $2,821 million and $2,772 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are expensed as incurred.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P89_S1	Excluding the impact of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions, which are included in Net Sales and Cost of Sales, costs for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings were $2,689 million, $2,607 million and $2,559 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P90_S0	Research and development costs of $179 million, $191 million and $178 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and are expensed as incurred.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	Shipping and handling expenses of $400 million, $363 million and $364 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and include distribution center costs, third-party logistics costs and outbound freight.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with periods of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P92_S1	The Company considers lease renewals when such renewals are reasonably assured.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P93_S0	From time to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding from its lessors.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P93_S1	These amounts are recorded as deferred liabilities and amortized over the remaining lease term as a reduction of rent expense.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P94_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company s license agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors trademarks.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P95_S1	Our current licenses have an initial term of approximately 5 years to 10 years, and are renewable subject to the Company s compliance with the license agreement provisions.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P95_S2	Most of our license agreements have renewal terms in 5 year increments, with potential renewal periods ranging from approximately 5 years to 25 years.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P95_S3	Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P96_S0	Most of the Company s licenses were entered into to create new business.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P96_S1	In some cases, the Company acquired, or entered into, a license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a pre-existing beauty products business.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P96_S2	In those cases, other intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P97_S0	Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P97_S1	Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P98_S1	Upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock units, performance share units, performance share units based on total stockholder return and long-term performance share units, the resulting excess tax benefits, if any, are credited to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P98_S2	Any resulting tax deficiencies will first be offset against those cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P98_S3	If the cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital are exhausted, tax deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P99_S1	The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P99_S2	Included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P99_S3	If the Company s assessment of realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P100_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P100_S2	The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P100_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P100_S4	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P101_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P101_S2	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P102_S0	In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance that amends how companies present net periodic benefit cost in the income statement and balance sheet relating to defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P102_S1	Within the income statement, the new guidance requires companies to report the service cost component within operating expenses and report the other components of net periodic benefit cost below operating income (if one is reported).
1001250_17_ITEM15_P102_S2	In addition, within the balance sheet, the guidance changes the components of the pension cost eligible for capitalization to the service cost component only (e.g., as a cost of internally manufactured inventory or a self-constructed asset).
1001250_17_ITEM15_P103_S0	Effective for the Company Fiscal 2019 first quarter, with early adoption permitted as of the first interim period in fiscal 2018.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P104_S0	The guidance must be applied (a) retrospectively as it pertains to the income statement classification of the components of net periodic benefit cost and (b) prospectively as it pertains to future capitalization of service costs.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P105_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P106_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company will adopt this guidance when it becomes effective and although certain components of pension expense will be reclassified out of operating income, the Company does not believe this will have a material impact on reported operating income.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P107_S0	In January 2017, FASB issued authoritative guidance which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P108_S0	The single quantitative step test requires companies to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P108_S1	The Company will continue to have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P109_S0	Effective for the Company Fiscal 2021 first quarter, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P110_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company did not elect to apply this guidance to its fiscal 2017 impairment testing and will continue to assess the impact of adopting it on future interim and annual impairment tests.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P111_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the way companies account for income taxes relating to intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P111_S1	This new guidance requires that an entity recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory in the period in which the transfer takes place.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P111_S2	Under current guidance, recognition of current and deferred income taxes of an intra-entity asset transfer is deferred.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P111_S3	This new guidance may affect consolidated earnings where the intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory occurs between entities in jurisdictions with different tax rates.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P111_S4	This guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P112_S0	Effective for the Company Fiscal 2019 first quarter, with early adoption permitted.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P113_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P114_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires companies to utilize an impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other financial instruments, which include trade and other receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, to record an allowance for credit risk based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P114_S1	In addition, this new guidance changes the recognition method for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities, which can occur as a result of market and credit risk, as well as additional disclosures.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P114_S2	In general, this guidance will require modified retrospective adoption for all outstanding instruments that fall under this guidance.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P115_S0	Effective for the Company Fiscal 2021 first quarter .
1001250_17_ITEM15_P116_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company is currently evaluating the impact of applying this guidance on its financial instruments, such as accounts receivable and short- and long-term investments.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P117_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the way companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P117_S1	This new guidance requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based compensation awards be recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P117_S2	In addition, companies are required to treat the tax effects of exercised or vested awards as discrete items in the period that they occur.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P117_S3	This guidance also permits an employer to withhold up to the maximum statutory withholding rates in a jurisdiction without triggering liability classification, allows companies to elect to account for forfeitures as they occur, and provides requirements for the cash flow classification of cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes and for the classification of excess tax benefits.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P117_S4	The new guidance prescribes different transition methods for the various provisions.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P118_S0	Effective for the Company Fiscal 2018 first quarter, with early adoption permitted.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P119_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company will adopt this guidance in its fiscal 2018 first quarter.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P119_S1	For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $42 million and $22 million of excess tax benefits, respectively, directly in its consolidated statements of equity.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P119_S2	These amounts may or may not be representative of future amounts to be recognized in the income statement upon the adoption of this new standard, as the impact of the adoption will be primarily dependent on the timing and intrinsic value of stock-based compensation awards, employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P120_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P121_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheets with the liability being equal to the present value of the lease payments.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P121_S1	The right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability adjusted for certain costs such as direct costs.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P121_S2	Lease expense will be recognized similar to current accounting guidance with operating leases resulting in a straight-line expense, and financing leases resulting in a front-loaded expense similar to the current accounting for capital leases.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P121_S3	This guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements, and provides for certain practical expedients.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P122_S0	Effective for the Company Fiscal 2020 first quarter, with early adoption permitted .
1001250_17_ITEM15_P123_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company currently has an implementation team in place that is performing a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the adoption of this guidance.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P123_S1	While the Company has not completed its evaluation, it believes the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on its consolidated balance sheets.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P124_S0	As disclosed in Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies , the Company has $2,427 million in future minimum lease commitments as of June 30, 2017.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P124_S1	Upon adoption, the Company s lease liability will generally be based on the present value of such payments and the related right-of use asset will generally be based on the lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P125_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines how companies should report revenues from contracts with customers.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P125_S1	The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P125_S2	It provides companies with a single comprehensive five-step principles-based model to use in accounting for revenue and supersedes current revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific and transaction-specific revenue guidance.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P126_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the principal versus agent guidance in its new revenue recognition standard.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P126_S1	These amendments do not change the key aspects of the principal versus agent guidance, including the definition that an entity is a principal if it controls the good or service prior to it being transferred to a customer, but the amendments clarify the implementation guidance related to the considerations that must be made during the contract evaluation process.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P127_S0	In April 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the new standard to clarify the guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P128_S0	In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarified certain terms, guidance and disclosure requirements during the transition period related to completed contracts and contract modifications.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P128_S1	In addition, the FASB provided clarification on the concept of collectability, the calculation of the fair value of noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P129_S0	In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to reflect the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff s rescission of their prior comments that covered, among other things, accounting for shipping and handling costs and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P130_S0	In December 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends various aspects of the new standard to clarify certain terms, guidance and disclosure requirements.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P130_S1	In particular, the guidance addresses disclosure requirements for remaining performance obligations, impairment testing for contract costs and accrual of advertising costs, as well as clarifies several examples.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P131_S0	Effective for the Company Fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P131_S1	An entity is permitted to apply the foregoing guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented, with certain practical expedients, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P132_S0	Impact on consolidated financial statements The Company will apply all of this new guidance when they become effective in fiscal 2019 and has not yet selected a transition method.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P133_S0	Although the Company has not yet completed its evaluation, it has preliminarily determined that certain promotional goods, such as samples and testers, may be reclassified from Selling, general and administrative expenses to Cost of Sales in the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P133_S1	Additionally, the Company s customer loyalty programs, which have historically been accounted for under the incremental cost approach, will be accounted for as a reduction of revenue based on the fair value of estimated future redemptions when the obligation is created (i.e. upon sale of the product to the consumer).
1001250_17_ITEM15_P134_S0	No other recently issued accounting pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P146_S1	The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill, which includes value associated with assembled workforce.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P147_S0	The calculation of purchase price and purchase price allocation, which is pending finalization of tax-related items and completion of the related final valuation, is as follows:

1001250_17_ITEM15_P152_S3	Approximately $316 million of goodwill recorded in connection with certain of these acquisitions is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P154_S0	The estimate of the fair values of acquired amortizable intangible assets was determined using a multi-period excess earnings income approach.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P154_S1	Fair value was determined under this approach by estimating future cash flows over multiple periods, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P155_S0	The estimate of the fair values of acquired intangible assets not subject to amortization was determined using an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P163_S2	This determination was made based on updated long-term plans, finalized and approved in June 2017, that reflected lower sales growth projections due to a softer than expected retail environment for those brands.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P163_S3	As a result, a Step 2 impairment assessment was performed and the Company recorded an impairment charge of the goodwill related to these reporting units of $28 million.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P163_S4	The fair values of the reporting units were based upon the average of the income approach, which utilizes estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows, and the market approach, which utilizes performance multiples based on market peers.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P164_S0	Fr d ric Malle trademarks, as well as the RODIN olio lusso persona and customer relationship intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P168_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P169_S0	In May 2016, the Company announced a multi-year initiative ( Leading Beauty Forward, LBF or the Program ) to build on its strengths and better leverage its cost structure to free resources for investment to continue its growth momentum.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P169_S1	LBF is designed to enhance the Company s go-to-market capabilities, reinforce its leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P170_S0	The Company plans to approve specific initiatives under LBF through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and expects to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P170_S1	Inclusive of charges recorded from inception through June 30, 2017, the Company expects that LBF will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million before taxes.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P171_S0	Restructuring actions to be taken over the duration of LBF involve the redesigning, resizing and reorganization of select corporate functions and go-to-market structures to improve effectiveness and create cost efficiencies in support of increased investment in growth drivers.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P172_S0	As the Company continues to grow, it is important to more efficiently support its diverse portfolio of brands, channels and geographies in the rapidly evolving prestige beauty environment.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P172_S1	The initiatives being evaluated include the creation of a shared-services structure in existing or lower-cost locations, either using Company resources or through external service providers.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P172_S2	The Company also believes that decision-making in key areas of innovation, marketing and digital communications should be moved closer to the consumer to increase speed and local relevance.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P173_S1	This reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P180_S1	This includes the relocation of certain operations and positions, with some employees being separated and positions replaced in a new location.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P200_S1	As part of the GTI Restructuring, the Company transitioned its GTI from Company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where the Company pays for services as they are used.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P209_S0	The determination and estimation of the future income tax consequences in all relevant taxing jurisdictions involves the application of highly complex tax laws in the countries involved, particularly in the United States, and is based on the tax profile of the Company in the year of earnings repatriation.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P244_S5	Costs associated with entering into derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company s consolidated financial results.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P246_S0	For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P247_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P247_S1	The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedges and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P247_S2	If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P257_S0	Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P258_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions, as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P258_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P259_S0	The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P259_S1	The Company may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P259_S2	The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of June 2019.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P259_S3	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P259_S4	Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P260_S0	The Company may enter into interest rate forward contracts to hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P260_S1	The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the cost of debt issuance.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P262_S0	The ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and interest rate derivatives is recorded in current-period earnings.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P262_S1	For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P262_S2	If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period earnings.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P262_S3	As of June 30, 2017, the Company s foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P266_S0	The estimated net loss on the Company s derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges as of June 30, 2017 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $18 million.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P266_S1	The accumulated gain (loss) on derivative instruments in AOCI was $(4) million and $50 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P267_S0	The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P267_S1	The Company has interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $250 million, $450 million and $250 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2020 Senior Notes, 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes, respectively, to variable interest rates based on three-month LIBOR plus a margin.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P267_S2	These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair-value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P268_S0	As a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P268_S1	The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P268_S2	Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $13 million at June 30, 2017.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P268_S3	To manage this risk, the Company has strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P268_S4	Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P269_S0	The Company records certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P269_S1	The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that require initial measurement or remeasurement at fair value, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations and goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P270_S0	The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P270_S1	The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P271_S0	Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P272_S0	Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P273_S0	Level 3: Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P273_S1	The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument s valuation.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P275_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2017:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P276_S0	The following table presents the Company s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P277_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P278_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P279_S0	The following table presents the Company s impairment charges for certain of its nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, classified as Level 3, during fiscal 2017:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P280_S0	Fr d ric Malle reporting units as of April 1, 2017, the Company used the average of the income approach, which utilizes estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows, and the market approach, which utilizes performance multiples based on market peers.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P280_S1	For both reporting units, decreased cash flows in future forecasted periods would not support a value in excess of carrying value and therefore the Company concluded that $28 million of goodwill was impaired.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P281_S0	Fr d ric Malle trademarks as of April 1, 2017, the Company assessed the future performance of the reporting units and determined that decreased cash flows in future forecasted periods would not support the carrying values of the trademarks.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P281_S1	The Company therefore concluded that the remaining carrying value of the RODIN olio lusso trademark was impaired.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P281_S2	The impairment charge for the Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle trademark was de minimis.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P281_S3	The fair values of the trademarks were determined utilizing a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P281_S4	An assessment related to the carrying value of the RODIN olio lusso customer relationship and persona intangible assets also led to the conclusion of full impairment.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P282_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P283_S0	Cash and cash equivalents Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, money market funds and time deposits.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P283_S1	The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily due to the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P284_S0	Available-for-sale securities Available-for-sale securities are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and are valued using third-party pricing services, and for time deposits, the carrying amount approximates fair value .
1001250_17_ITEM15_P284_S1	To determine fair value, the pricing services use market prices or prices derived from other observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P285_S0	Foreign currency forward contracts The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P285_S1	The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P285_S2	To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to 12 months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than 12 months.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P286_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P287_S0	Interest rate swap contracts The fair values of the Company s interest rate swap contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P287_S1	The significant observable inputs to the model, such as treasury yield curves, swap yield curves and LIBOR forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P288_S0	Current and long-term debt The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P288_S1	To a lesser extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P288_S2	The Company s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P289_S0	Additional purchase price payable The Company s additional purchase price payable represents fixed minimum additional purchase price that was discounted using the Company s incremental borrowing rate, which was approximately 1%.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P289_S1	The additional purchase price payable is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P290_S0	Contingent consideration Contingent consideration obligations consist of potential obligations related to the Company s acquisitions in previous years.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P290_S1	The amounts to be paid under these obligations are contingent upon the achievement of stipulated financial targets by the business subsequent to acquisition.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P290_S2	The fair values of the contingent consideration related to certain acquisition earn-outs were estimated using a probability-weighted discount model that considers the achievement of the conditions upon which the respective contingent obligation is dependent ( Monte Carlo Method ).
1001250_17_ITEM15_P291_S0	The Monte Carlo Method has various inputs into the valuation model, in addition to the risk-adjusted projected future operating results of the acquired entities, which include the following ranges at June 30, 2017:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P292_S0	Significant changes in the projected future operating results would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P292_S1	Changes to the discount rates, volatilities or correlation factors would have a lesser effect.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P293_S0	The implied rates are deemed to be unobservable inputs and, as such, the Company s contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P294_S0	Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations for the year ended June 30, 2017 are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were as follows:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P295_S0	In June 2017, the Company revised and approved the long-term financial projections for its brands.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P295_S1	During this update, the Company noted that for certain of its fiscal 2015 and 2016 acquisitions, actual results and the most recent projections were lower during their respective earn-out measurement periods than the financial targets made at June 30, 2016 and it reassessed the likelihood of achieving those targets.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P295_S2	As a result, the Company recognized a $57 million gain within Selling, general and administrative expenses to reflect the adjusted fair value of its contingent consideration, primarily related to the acquisitions of GLAMGLOW, Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle and Le Labo as of June 30, 2017.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P295_S3	The gain impacted the skin care and fragrance product categories by $24 million and $33 million, respectively, and the Americas and Europe, the Middle East Africa regions by $43 million and $14 million, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P295_S4	The Company also considered whether the change in the financial projections impacted the fair values of the related reporting units and intangible assets, see Note 7 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for discussion of fiscal 2017 impairments.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P296_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P297_S0	The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P297_S1	Several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P297_S2	In certain instances, the Company adjusts benefits in connection with international employee transfers.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P298_S0	The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P298_S1	The Company seeks to maintain appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P298_S2	For contributions, the Company would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ), as amended, and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P299_S0	The Company also has an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P300_S0	The Company maintains international pension plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P300_S1	The Company s funding policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P300_S2	The Company s most significant defined benefit pension obligations are included in the plan summaries below.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P301_S0	The Company maintains a domestic post-retirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P301_S1	Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they retire.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P301_S2	Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P301_S3	Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the retiree.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P301_S4	It is the Company s practice to fund a portion of these benefits as incurred and may provide discretionary funding for future liabilities up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P302_S0	Certain of the Company s international subsidiaries and affiliates have post-retirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P304_S0	The significant components of the above mentioned plans as of and for the years ended June 30 are summarized as follows:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P305_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P306_S0	The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P306_S1	The discount rate for the Company s Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P306_S2	The Company used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of the Company s Domestic Plans.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P306_S3	For the Company s international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P307_S0	In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P308_S0	Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P308_S1	The assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate for the coming year is 7.33% while the weighted-average ultimate trend rate of 4.53% is expected to be reached in approximately 19 years.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P308_S2	A 100 basis-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2017 would have had the following effects:

1001250_17_ITEM15_P312_S0	The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the Company s pension plans at June 30 are as follows:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P313_S0	International pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of the plans assets had aggregate projected benefit obligations of $281 million and $330 million and aggregate fair value of plan assets of $137 million and $165 million at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P313_S1	International pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the plans assets had aggregate accumulated benefit obligations of $220 million and $226 million and aggregate fair value of plan assets of $103 million and $93 million at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P314_S0	The expected cash flows for the Company s pension and post-retirement plans are as follows:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P315_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P316_S0	The Company s investment strategy for its pension and post-retirement plan assets is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset classes with the primary goal of meeting long-term cash requirements as they become due.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P316_S1	Assets are primarily invested in diversified funds that hold equity or debt securities to maintain the security of the funds while maximizing the returns within each plan s investment policy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P316_S2	The investment policy for each plan specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for selection of investment managers and procedures to monitor overall investment performance, as well as investment manager performance.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P317_S0	The Company s target asset allocation at June 30, 2017 is as follows:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P318_S0	The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for plan assets measured at fair value:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P319_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash and time deposits.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P319_S1	The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P320_S0	The fair values are determined using the Net Asset Value ( NAV ) provided by the administrator of the fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets at the measurement date.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P320_S1	These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P320_S2	For some assets the Company is utilizing the NAV as a practical expedient and those investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P321_S0	The fair values are determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P321_S1	These investments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P322_S0	Debt instruments The fair values are determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from observable market inputs such as credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, benchmark curves and other industry and economic factors.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P322_S1	These investments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P323_S0	The fair values are determined using the closing price reported on a major market where the individual securities are traded.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P323_S1	These investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P324_S0	Commingled funds The fair values of publicly traded funds are based upon market quotes and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P324_S1	The fair values for non-publicly traded funds are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets at the measurement date.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P324_S2	These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P324_S3	When the Company is utilizing the NAV as a practical expedient those investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P324_S4	These investments have monthly redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from 10 to 30 days.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P324_S5	There are no unfunded commitments related to these investments.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P325_S0	Insurance contracts The fair values are based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios, as well as the consideration of the creditworthiness of the issuer.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P325_S1	The underlying investments are primarily government, asset-backed and fixed income securities.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P326_S0	Insurance contracts are generally classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices or other observable inputs for pricing.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P327_S0	Interests in limited partnerships and hedge fund investments The fair values are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator as a practical expedient, and therefore these investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P327_S1	These investments have monthly and quarterly redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from 30 to 90 days.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P327_S2	Unfunded commitments related to these investments are de minimis.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P330_S0	(1) Per the fiscal 2017 adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB, certain assets that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P331_S0	The following table presents the fair values of the Company s pension and post-retirement plan assets by asset category as of June 30, 2016:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P332_S0	(1) Per the fiscal 2017 adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB, certain assets that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P335_S2	The Savings Plan is subject to the applicable provisions of ERISA.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P336_S0	The Company matches a portion of the participant s contributions after one year of service under a predetermined formula based on the participant s contribution level.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P336_S1	The Company s contributions were $39 million, $37 million and $35 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P336_S2	Shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock are not an investment option in the Savings Plan and the Company does not use such shares to match participants contributions.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P337_S0	The Company has agreements with certain employees and outside directors who defer compensation.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P337_S1	The Company accrues for such compensation, and either interest thereon or for the change in the value of cash units.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P337_S2	The amounts included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $75 million and $71 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P339_S2	Projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2017.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P340_S0	(2) Minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P341_S0	Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, as well as common area maintenance.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P341_S1	These amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P341_S2	Such amounts have not been material to total rent expense.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P341_S3	Total rental expense included in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was $457 million, $442 million and $402 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P342_S1	Future contingent consideration, earn-out payments and royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2017, without consideration for potential renewal periods.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P343_S0	(4) Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P343_S1	As of June 30, 2017, the noncurrent portion of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties was $73 million.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P343_S2	At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P344_S0	THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P345_S0	The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its business.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P345_S1	Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P361_S0	The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
1001250_17_ITEM15_P362_S0	The Company uses a weighted-average expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P362_S1	The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P363_S0	For the weighted-average expected option life assumption, the Company considers the exercise behavior for past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P363_S1	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate for the expected term of the options and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P372_S0	The grant date fair value of the PSUs of $11 million was estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions for each performance period, respectively: contractual life of 33, 45 and 57 months, average risk-free interest rate of 0.3%, 0.5% and 0.7% and a dividend yield of 1.0%.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P373_S0	Using the historical stock prices and dividends from public sources, the Company estimated the covariance structure of the returns on S P 500 stocks.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P375_S1	Since the Company achieved positive Net Earnings, as defined in the PSU award agreement, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, performance and vesting of each tranche will be based on the Company achieving positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the PSU award agreement, during the relative performance period.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P375_S2	Payment with respect to a tranche will be made on the third anniversary of the last day of the respective performance period.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P380_S2	The Company recorded $2 million, $2 million and $3 million as compensation expense to reflect additional deferrals and the change in the market value for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P383_S0	As of June 30, 2017, there were 1.8 million stock options excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P393_S1	As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P394_S0	Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P395_S0	While the Company s results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics.

1001250_17_ITEM15_P397_S1	Returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to the product categories because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures, and to transform and modernize the Company s GTI.
1001250_17_ITEM15_P397_S2	The accounting policies for the Company s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales.

1001250_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	There are also more than 650 Company-branded freestanding stores around the world operated by authorized third parties, primarily in Europe, the Middle East Africa.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	Products from most of our brands are sold online through Company-owned and operated e-commerce and m-commerce sites, through various sites operated by authorized retailers and through third-party online platforms.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	These sites and/or platforms are in approximately 40 countries.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	While today a majority of these online sales are generated in the United States, the United Kingdom and China, we have additional opportunity to expand online sales globally.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	We maintain dedicated sales teams that manage our retail accounts.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	We have wholly-owned operations in over 50 countries, and two controlling interests that operate in several countries, through which we market, sell and distribute our products.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	In certain countries, we sell our products through carefully selected distributors that share our commitment to protecting the image and position of our brands.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P44_S3	In addition, we sell certain products in select domestic and international U.S. military exchanges.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P44_S4	For information regarding our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region, see Item 8.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P44_S5	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20 Segment Data and Related Information .
1001250_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our strategy is to build strong relationships globally with select retailers, as well as with our consumers directly through freestanding stores, e-commerce sites and social media.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	Senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis, and we believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our strategy to market and promote our products begins with our well-diversified portfolio of more than 25 distinctive brands across four product categories.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our portfolio can be deployed in multiple distribution channels, key travel corridors and geographies where our global reputation and awareness of our brands benefit us.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	Our geographic and distribution channel diversity allows us to engage local consumers across an array of developed and emerging markets by emphasizing products and services with the greatest local relevance, inclusiveness and appeal.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P46_S3	This strategy is built around Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P46_S4	Our founder, Mrs. Est e Lauder, formulated this unique marketing philosophy to provide High-Touch service and high quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P46_S5	Our High-Touch approach is demonstrated through our integrated consumer engagement models that leverage our product specialists and technology to provide the consumer with a distinct and truly personalized experience that can include personal consultations with beauty advisors, in person or online, who demonstrate and educate the consumer on product usage and application.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P46_S6	We plan to continue to leverage our core strengths, including the quality of our products, our High-Touch care to consumers and a diversified portfolio of brands, channels and geographies.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our marketing strategies vary by brand, local market and distribution channel.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	We have a diverse portfolio of brands, and we employ different engagement models suited to each brand s equity, distribution, product focus, understanding of the core consumer and local relevance.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P47_S2	This enables us to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new consumers, build loyalty, drive consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P47_S3	Our marketing planning approach leverages local insights to optimize allocation of resources across different media outlets and retail touch points to resonate with our most discerning consumers most effectively.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P47_S4	This includes strategically deploying our brands and tailoring product assortments and communications to fit local tastes and preferences in cities and neighborhoods.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P47_S5	Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house teams, in collaboration with external resources, that design and produce the sales materials, social media strategies, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P47_S6	For a number of products, we create and deploy 360 integrated consumer engagement programs.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P47_S7	We build brand equity and drive traffic to retail locations and to our own and authorized retailers websites through digital and social media, magazines and newspapers, television, billboards in cities and airports, and direct mail and email.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P47_S8	In addition, we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products in digital and social media and print, to drive influencer amplification.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	We are increasing our brand awareness and sales through our strategic emphasis on technology, by continuing to elevate our digital presence encompassing e-commerce and m-commerce, as well as digital, social media and influencer marketing.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	We are investing in new analytical capabilities to promote a more personalized experience across our distribution channels.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	We continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), support e-commerce and m-commerce businesses via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and High-Touch consumer engagement, in order to continue to offer unparalleled service and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P48_S3	We also support our authorized retailers to strengthen their e-commerce businesses and drive sales of our brands on their websites.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P48_S4	We have opportunities to expand our brand portfolio online around the world, and we are investing in and testing new omnichannel concepts in the United States, China and other markets to increase brand loyalty by better serving consumers as they shop across channels and travel corridors.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P48_S5	We have dedicated resources to implement creative, coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Promotional activities and in-store displays are designed to attract new consumers, build demand and loyalty and introduce existing consumers to other product offerings from the respective brands.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as sampling programs, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase, and we continue to believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	Such activities attract consumers to our counters and websites and keep existing consumers engaged.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P49_S3	Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers, retailers, beauty advisors and makeup artists at the points of sale to enable us to offer a seamless experience across channels of distribution.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Information technology supports our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	We continue to maintain and enhance our information technology systems in alignment with our long-term strategy.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Many elements of our global information technology infrastructure are managed by third-party providers under vendor-owned, cloud-based models where we pay for services as they are consumed.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	This allows a more scalable platform to support current and future requirements and improves our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	We recognize that technology presents opportunities for competitive advantages, and we continue to invest in new capabilities across various aspects of our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	During fiscal 2018, we completed retail system upgrades to our freestanding stores in North America, continued our implementation in Asia/Pacific and began our implementation in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	Over the next few years, we plan to implement new systems and capabilities, including upgraded retail merchandising solutions in certain key markets globally.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our research and development group, which includes scientists, engineers and other employees involved in product innovation and packaging design and development, works closely with our marketing and product development teams and third-party suppliers to generate ideas, develop new products and product-line extensions, create new packaging concepts, and improve, redesign or reformulate existing products.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	In addition, these research and development personnel provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how to quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products that meet or exceed consumer expectations.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	The research and development group has long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	Members of the research and development group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	As our business continues to grow globally, and to satisfy the demand for locally relevant consumer products, we have increased our focus on innovation in Asia/Pacific, especially in China, as well as in Korea and Japan.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our research and development costs totaled $181 million, $179 million and $191 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are expensed as incurred.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	As of June 30, 2018, we had approximately 730 employees engaged in research and development activities.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see Item 2.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	We do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, and do not ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	We manufacture our products primarily in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies, minimize our impact on the environment and reduce costs.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	While we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and third-party manufacturers is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to implement improvements in capacity, technology, and productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P57_S4	From time to time, demand changes may challenge our capacity for certain subcategories on a short-term basis, but we believe that this will not impact our ability to meet our annual or longer-term strategic objectives.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P57_S5	To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we also continue to utilize a network of third-party manufacturers on a global basis.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	We have established regional distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations function.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P59_S3	We review our supplier base periodically with the specific objectives of improving quality, increasing innovation and speed-to-market and reducing costs.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P59_S4	In addition, we focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P59_S5	Some of our products rely on a single or limited number of suppliers; however, we believe that our portfolio of suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P59_S6	In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	We are continually benchmarking the performance of our supply chain and augment our supply base and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	There is significant competition within each market where our skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products are sold.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	Brand recognition, product quality and effectiveness, distribution channels, accessibility, and price point are some of the factors that impact consumers choices among competing products and brands.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	Marketing (including social media activities), merchandising, in-store experiences and demonstrations, and new product innovations also have an impact on consumers purchasing decisions.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	With our portfolio of diverse brands sold in a variety of channels we are one of the world s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	Some of our competitors are large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	They include L Oreal S.A.; LVMH Mo t Hennessey Louis Vuitton; Shiseido Company, Ltd.; Coty, Inc.; Chanel S.A.; Puig SL; Kao Corp; Amorepacific Corp; and Groupe Clarins.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P63_S2	We also face competition from a number of independent brands, some of which are backed by private-equity investors, as well as some retailers that have their own beauty brands.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P63_S3	Certain of our competitors also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	We own the trademark rights used in connection with the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of our products both in the United States and in the other principal countries where such products are sold, including Est e Lauder, Clinique, Aramis, Prescriptives, Lab Series, Origins, M A C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, Ojon, Smashbox, Le Labo, RODIN olio lusso, Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle, GLAMGLOW, By Kilian, BECCA and Too Faced and the names of many of the products sold under these brands.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	We are the exclusive worldwide licensee for fragrances, cosmetics and/or related products for Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Kiton, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, Dr. Andrew Weil, Ermenegildo Zegna, AERIN and Tory Burch.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	For further discussion on license arrangements, including their duration, see Item 8.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies License Arrangements .
1001250_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	We protect our trademarks in the United States and significant markets worldwide.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	In addition, several products and packaging for such products are covered by design patents or copyrights.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P67_S2	While we consider these patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is considered material to the conduct of our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	At June 30, 2018, we had approximately 46,000 full-time employees worldwide (including demonstrators at points of sale who are employed by us).
1001250_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	We have no employees in the United States that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P68_S2	A limited number of employees outside of the United States are covered by a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, advertising, shipment, disposal and safety of our products.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P69_S2	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable federal, state, local and international and other countries rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment or that relate to climate change.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	There are no significant capital expenditures for environmental control or climate change matters either planned in the current year or expected in the near future.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions or the particular retail calendars followed by our customers that are retailers, which may impact their order placement and receipt of goods.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P71_S3	Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	We make available financial information, news releases and other information on our website at www.elcompanies.com.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports, as well as any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available free of charge via the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov or our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports and amendments with, or furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

1001250_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	The Board of Directors has developed corporate governance practices to help it fulfill its responsibilities to stockholders in providing general direction and oversight of management.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	These practices are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P73_S2	We also have a Code of Conduct ( Code ) applicable to all employees, officers and directors of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and other senior financial officers.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P73_S3	These documents and any waiver of a provision of the Code granted to any senior officer or director or any material amendment to the Code, may be found in the Investors section of our website: www.elcompanies.com under the heading Corporate Governance.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P73_S4	The charters for the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Board Affairs Committee may be found in the same location on our website.

1001250_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our executive officers:
1001250_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	All of the executive officers named above have been employees of the Company for more than five years, with the exception of Michael O Hare.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	Mr. O Hare joined the Company in 2013.
1001250_18_ITEM1_P75_S2	Previously, he was the Global Chief Human Resources Officer with Heineken N.V., a global brewer based in the Netherlands, since 2009.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are risks associated with an investment in our securities.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading prices of our securities, may be adversely affected.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and others are newer companies (some backed by private-equity investors) competing in distribution channels where we are less represented.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In some cases, our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Competition in the beauty business is based on a variety of factors including pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors actions in these areas.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our Company has a well-recognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by social media and many other factors.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If our reputation is adversely affected, our ability to attract and retain customers and consumers could be impacted.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We must continually work to develop, manufacture and market new products, maintain and adapt our High-Touch services to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, successfully manage our inventories, and modernize and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The issue is compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our financial results will suffer.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	In addition, from time to time, sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands, channels or countries.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	If such a situation persists or a number of brands, channels or countries fail to perform as expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In key markets, such as the United States, we have seen a decline in retail traffic in some of our department store customers and certain of our freestanding stores.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	and m-commerce platforms (both in mass and prestige distribution) that are impacting our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Consolidation or liquidation in the retail trade, from these or other factors, may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers and could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	A severe, adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If one or more of our largest customers change their strategies (including pricing or promotional activities), or if our relationship with any large customer is changed or terminated for any reason, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Achieving our long-term strategy will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, supply chain facilities, technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These investments may result in short-term costs without any current sales and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings, at least in the short term.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in sales and profitability, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We continuously review acquisition and strategic investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If required, the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future, a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results, then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Acquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks, which may include:
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from, or customers of, acquired businesses; diversion of management s attention from our existing businesses; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business; and risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business or to achieve the long-term plan for such business, as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition and investment activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A general economic downturn, or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	If a retailer was to liquidate, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer s inventory of our products to protect brand equity.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions, for example, from events such as a pandemic, or other local or global health issues, conflicts around the world, or as a result of a terrorist attack, retaliation or similar threats, or as a result of adverse weather conditions, climate changes or seismic events, can have a short-term and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Events that impact consumers willingness or ability to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business, including travel retail, a significant contributor to our overall results, and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	A downturn in the economies of, or continuing recessions in, the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence, the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to certain brick-and-mortar stores in the United States and the United Kingdom as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We are also cautious of foreign currency movements, including their impact on tourism.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as Brazil and in the Middle East; the United Kingdom s anticipated exit from the European Union; social and political issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Volatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	While we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If any financial institutions that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements, such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Changes in the laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	These changes include accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, laws and regulations relating to data privacy, anti-corruption, advertising, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, product registration, ingredients, chemicals and packaging, as well as laws in Europe and elsewhere relating to selective distribution, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are involved, and may become involved in the future, in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that could adversely affect our financial results.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, other disputes or regulatory proceedings.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In general, claims made by us or against us in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business or financial results.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We are currently vigorously contesting certain of these claims.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	As we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways, including the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business and/or reputation.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, our product claims are found to be deceptive, or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers expectations, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and/or become subject to liability or claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In addition, third parties may sell counterfeit versions of some of our products.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	These counterfeit products may pose safety risks, may fail to meet consumers expectations, and may have a negative impact on our reputation.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our key personnel.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The unexpected loss of one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Competition for these employees can be intense.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We are subject to risks related to the global scope of our operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We operate on a global basis, with a majority of our fiscal 2018 net sales and operating income generated outside the United States.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located inside and outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Our global operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places, which can affect our results of operations, the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets, the cost of certain inventory and non-inventory items required in our operations, and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets; foreign or U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on trade, immigration and travel, operations, and investments; currency exchange controls; restrictions on imports and exports, including license requirements; tariffs; and taxes; lack of well-established or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate; adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; and social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	A disruption in our operations or supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information technology, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Some of our products rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Further, the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities, in compliance with applicable standards, and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our information technology and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches, outages, and other risks.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We rely on information technology (outsourced and in-house) that support our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We have e-commerce, m-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and other events.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems may be vulnerable to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats such as computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P43_S4	The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information technology and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Failure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We are dependent upon automated information technology processes.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain information that is confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive, including personal information with respect to customers, consumers and employees.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Moreover, the success of our e-commerce and m-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and personal information, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees , consumers and customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P45_S5	In addition, a security or data privacy breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P45_S6	Furthermore, third parties including our suppliers and customers may also rely on information technology and be subject to such cybersecurity breaches.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P45_S7	These breaches may negatively impact their businesses, which could in turn disrupt our supply chain and/or our business operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are subject to risks associated with our global information technology.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our implementation and maintenance of global information technology (outsourced and in-house), including supply chain and finance systems, human resource management systems, creative asset management and retail operating systems, as well as associated hardware and use of cloud based models, involve risks and uncertainties.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Failure to implement and maintain these and other systems as planned, in terms of timing, specifications, costs, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	As we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	As part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	These include certain information technology, finance and human resource functions.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with the outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more entities to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition, if we transition systems to one or more new, or among existing, external service providers, we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our financial performance.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our expectations regarding certain aspects of our business.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	This could include forecasts of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Accordingly, when we announced our year-end financial results for fiscal 2018, we provided guidance as to certain assumptions, including ranges for our expected net sales and earnings per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2018 and the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P52_S5	While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we assume no responsibility to provide additional guidance or update any of our guidance or other forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P52_S6	In addition, the longer-term guidance we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P52_S7	Such targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	At any time, we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program, and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our business, whether it be about net sales and/or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, or otherwise, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q).
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings or other financial metrics, or business outcomes, will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our business or financial results for any future period.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P55_S5	We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We are controlled by the Lauder family.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	As a result, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	As of August 17, 2018, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having approximately 87% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In addition, there are four members of the Lauder family who are Company employees and members of our Board of Directors.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Another family member is a party to a consulting agreement and a license agreement with us.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	As a result of their stock ownership and positions at the Company, as well as our dual-class structure, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including all matters requiring stockholder approval (e.g. the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation, and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets) for the foreseeable future.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In addition, if significant stock indices decide to prohibit the inclusion of companies with dual-class stock structures, the price of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively impacted and could become more volatile.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.
1001250_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a controlled company under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards.

1001250_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of August 17, 2018, there were 7,889 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 14 record holders of Class B Common Stock.
1001250_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors.
1001250_18_ITEM5_P3_S1	The following table provides information relating to our repurchase of Class A Common Stock during the referenced periods:

1001250_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The table below summarizes selected financial information.
1001250_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto beginning on page F-1 of this report.

1001250_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) As a result of our July 2014 Strategic Modernization Initiative rollout, approximately $178 million of accelerated orders were recorded as net sales and approximately $127 million as operating income in fiscal 2014 that would have occurred in the fiscal 2015 first quarter, equal to approximately $.21 per diluted common share.
1001250_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	(3) During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a $5 million charge, on a before and after tax basis, related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, equal to $.01 per diluted common share.

1001250_18_ITEM6_P4_S0	(4) In February 2017, we issued 1.80%, 3.15% and 4.15% Senior Notes in a public offering, each with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million.
1001250_18_ITEM6_P4_S1	These Senior Notes are due in February 2020, March 2027 and March 2047, respectively.
1001250_18_ITEM6_P4_S2	We used the net proceeds of the offerings to redeem the Senior Notes due May 15, 2017 and for general corporate purposes.

1001250_18_ITEM6_P4_S4	In June 2015, we issued $300 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due June 15, 2045 in a public offering.
1001250_18_ITEM6_P5_S0	(5) Fiscal 2017 results included $23 million, after tax, or $.06 per diluted common share related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairments.
1001250_18_ITEM6_P6_S0	(6) Results include gain (loss) associated with changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to certain of our acquisitions of $33 million, $44 million, $(8) million and $(6) million, after tax, or $.09, $.12, $(.02) and $(.02) per diluted common share in fiscal 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1001250_18_ITEM6_P7_S0	(7) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA ), which, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate statutory income tax rate and established a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the Transition Tax ).
1001250_18_ITEM6_P7_S1	Fiscal 2018 results reflect impacts and charges resulting from the TCJA, including the Transition Tax, the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings of $(351) million, or $(.94) per diluted common share, $(53) million, or $(.14) per diluted common share and $(46) million, or $(.12) per diluted common share, respectively.
1001250_18_ITEM6_P7_S2	Fiscal 2017 results include $75 million, or $.20 per diluted common share, related to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
1001250_18_ITEM6_P7_S3	The deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance related to the accumulated carryforward of excess advertising and promotional expenses.
1001250_18_ITEM6_P7_S4	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a favorable change to the tax law in China was enacted that expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses, resulting in this change in realizability of the asset.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Item 8.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 20 Segment Data and Related Information for all periods presented.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:
1001250_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	In order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 39 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	We believe the best way to increase stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing consumers changing behaviors and shopping preferences.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Accordingly, our long-term strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	We plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our balanced, diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty .
1001250_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	We believe that our broad and inclusive range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumer s beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in mass-market distribution.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	In fiscal 2018, we have seen a resurgence of global prestige skin care growth.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our skin care product category benefited from the enduring strength of hero product lines such as Advanced Night Repair from Est e Lauder and Cr me de La Mer from La Mer, as well as recent product launches and targeted expanded consumer reach.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	The launches of Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix and Perfectionist Pro Rapid Firm + Lift Treatment from Est e Lauder were particularly successful in China and certain travel retail locations in Asia/Pacific.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	During fiscal 2018, we continued to expand the Cr me de La Mer and Genaissance de la Mer product lines from La Mer through the introduction of The Moisturizing Matte Lotion, The Moisturizing Cool Gel Creme, The Eye Expression Cream and The Infused Lotion.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Global prestige makeup sales also continued to grow; however, the pace was slower than in prior periods.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	We continued to benefit from growth in hero product lines such as Double Wear and Pure Color Envy from Est e Lauder as well as incremental net sales from Too Faced and BECCA, which we acquired during fiscal 2017.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	Most of our brands also benefited from strong demand for makeup, particularly in China and Hong Kong.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of our luxury fragrance brands.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	New product lines, such as the English Fields collection from Jo Malone London and the Oud Wood franchise from Tom Ford, as well as strength in certain existing product lines, have contributed to our success in the category.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	The category also benefited from strong growth and targeted expanded consumer reach of Le Labo and By Kilian.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	Increased interest in luxury fragrances in Asia has also helped category growth.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	We look for further opportunities to strengthen our business in this category there through targeted expanded consumer reach of our luxury brands.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	In our hair care category, our brands are reaching new consumers globally as we further expanded our presence in the travel retail, online and specialty-multi channels, such as the launch of Bumble and bumble in Ulta Beauty.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	During fiscal 2018, the Invati Advanced product line launch from Aveda also contributed to the success in the category.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our global footprint provides many avenues of potential growth.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Our regional organizations, and the expertise of our people there, enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	We are evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores, online and where they travel, including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	We tailor our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement and embrace an authentic understanding of cultural diversity.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P16_S4	We continuously strengthen our presence in large, image-building core markets, such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, and broaden our presence in emerging markets, including those in the Middle East, India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	In North America, we continue to deploy a number of strategies to accelerate growth, despite a challenging environment especially in brick and mortar retail, and in Latin America, we continue to launch new brands, expand social media outreach and encourage consumers to trade up from mass beauty products.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	In Europe, the Middle East Africa, we are expanding the consumer reach of many of our brands, strengthening their digital and social media presence and leveraging our strength in the makeup category to gain share in prestige beauty.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	In Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, we are leveraging our diversified brand portfolio and expansion on third-party online platforms to benefit from the strong consumer demand for prestige beauty.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	We approach distribution strategically by product category and geographic region and seek to optimize distribution by matching each of our brands with appropriate opportunities while maintaining high productivity per door.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	We are expanding certain brands into geographic markets where we see opportunities to fuel our sales growth.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	This includes adding brands to higher growth channels, such as travel retail, third-party online platforms, e- and m-commerce and specialty-multi brand retailers.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P20_S3	We also focus on brand-building retail activities that will expand consumer coverage for our brands.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	As part of this strategy, we continue to build and diversify our business in the travel retail channel around the world across brands and product categories.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building and profit margin expansion due to the increase in traveling consumers, particularly those from China, across multiple travel corridors.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	We continue to invest in digital and social media platforms and advertising, while focusing on locally relevant product assortment and communication skills of our representatives.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	At the same time, travel retail is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers willingness and ability to travel and spend.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Online net sales continue to grow strongly on a global basis, and we continue to launch e- and m-commerce sites in new and existing markets directly with our retail customers or on select third-party online platforms.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	We collaborate with our retailers and third-party online platforms globally to drive sales of our products on their online sites.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	We believe our success in delivering particularly strong online growth is a result of customization of our strategy to meet local market and cultural needs.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	We also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	While our business is performing well overall, we continue to face strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	In particular, we are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to certain brick-and-mortar stores in the United States and the United Kingdom as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	We are also cautious of foreign currency movements, including their impact on tourism.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P25_S3	Additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as Brazil and in the Middle East; the United Kingdom s anticipated exit from the European Union; social and political issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	We believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by developing and pursuing a diversified strategy with multiple engines of growth and accelerating areas of strength among our geographic regions, product categories, brands and channels of distribution.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	However, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged, there could be a negative effect on consumer confidence, demand, spending and willingness or ability to travel and, as a result, on our business.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	We will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	As disclosed in the Company s Form 10-Q for the fiscal 2018 third quarter, we learned that some of our testing related to certain product advertising claims did not meet our standards, necessitating further validation.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	As a result of this ongoing review, certain advertising claims are being modified.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	This is not a product safety issue and does not relate to the quality of the ingredients or the manufacturing of our products.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	Based on our review to date, we do not believe this matter will be material to the Company.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	We navigate through short-term volatility while focusing on our long-term strategy and using our multiple engines of growth that we believe will help promote sustainable results.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	We are increasing our presence in emerging markets, continuing efforts to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands, focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	We are also strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	We will continue to drive product, packaging, and conceptual innovation and creativity that we believe enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	Some initiatives will involve new sub-categories, and others may expand key franchises.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	In May 2016, we announced a multi-year initiative ( Leading Beauty Forward, or the Program ) to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Leading Beauty Forward is designed to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	We plan to approve specific initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	We previously estimated that Leading Beauty Forward would result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million, before taxes.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P29_S4	After reviewing additional potential initiatives and the progress of previously approved initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward that are being implemented, we have revised our estimates for cost approvals under the Program.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P29_S5	Inclusive of approvals from inception through June 30, 2018, we now estimate that Leading Beauty Forward may result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $900 million and $950 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset write-offs and other costs to implement these initiatives.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P29_S6	As many of our previously approved Leading Beauty Forward initiatives are progressing through their implementation stages and with the identification of potential new initiatives, we are revising our previous estimate of annual net benefits of between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P29_S7	After its full implementation, we now expect Leading Beauty Forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in Selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $350 million and $450 million, before taxes.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P29_S8	These savings can be used to improve margin, mitigate risk and invest in future growth initiatives.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P29_S9	For additional information about restructuring and other charges, see Item 8.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities .
1001250_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	During fiscal 2018, no impairment charges were recognized as a result of our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2018.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	The fair values of all reporting units with material goodwill were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	With regard to trademarks, the fair value of the Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle trademark was equal to its carrying value, and the fair value of the Too Faced trademark exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14%.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	As of June 30, 2018, the carrying values of the Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle and Too Faced trademarks were $33 million and $525 million, respectively.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	If these reporting units are adversely affected by a softness in the retail environment for their products, or if other business disruptions arise that cause a change to their long-term financial projections, there could be a negative effect on the fair values of the related trademarks, and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Based on our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing during fiscal 2017, we recorded impairment charges related to the goodwill and trademark of the Editions de Parfums Fr d ric Malle reporting unit, and impairment charges for the remaining goodwill and intangible assets related to the RODIN olio lusso reporting unit, of $31 million combined.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Reported net sales in fiscal 2018 increased in each major product category and grew in each geographic region.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	The unfavorable impact of fiscal 2017 acquisitions for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was due, in part, to a higher cost of sales related to Too Faced and BECCA.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P80_S3	The favorable impact from changes in strategic pricing and shipments of promotional items and gifts were offset by the unfavorable impact from new product introductions and market distribution, as well as higher costs from product sets, particularly in the travel retail channel.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	Partially offsetting this favorability was an increase in advertising and promotional activities due to increased spend on digital advertising and social media, including costs associated with influencers, as well as investments to support targeted expanded consumer reach.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses improved as compared to fiscal 2016, reflecting disciplined expense management across all areas and favorable mix shifts in the growth of our brands and channels.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P83_S3	The changes in the fair value of contingent consideration were due to the reassessment, in June 2017, of the potential earn-out amounts related to certain of our fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 acquisitions.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Reported operating margin in fiscal 2018 increased by approximately 70 basis points as compared to fiscal 2017, as the improvement in operating expense margin was partially offset by the decrease in gross margin, as previously noted.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	Reported operating results and operating margin in fiscal 2018 benefited from favorable foreign currency translation of $99 million, which had the largest impact on the Europe, the Middle East Africa region and the skin care product category.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P85_S2	The unfavorable impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities was offset by the favorable changes in goodwill and other intangible asset impairments and fair value of contingent consideration.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	The changes in fair value of contingent consideration and the fiscal 2017 goodwill and intangible asset impairments impacted the operating results of our product categories and geographic regions as follows:
1001250_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Reported operating results and operating margin in fiscal 2017 were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $59 million, which had the largest impact on the Europe, the Middle East Africa region and the makeup product category.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Operating margin in fiscal 2017 was flat as compared to fiscal 2016 as the decrease in gross margin was offset by our lower operating expense margin, as previously noted.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	The change in operating margin was unfavorably impacted by charges associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately 60 basis points and goodwill and other intangible asset impairments of approximately 30 basis points, partially offset by the favorable changes in fair value of contingent consideration of approximately 60 basis points.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	Adjusting for these items, operating margin for fiscal 2017 would have increased approximately 30 basis points.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	The goodwill and intangible asset impairments and changes in fair value of contingent consideration impacted the operating results of our product categories and geographic regions as follows:
1001250_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	Accordingly, the following discussions of Operating Income by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities of $257 million, or 2% of net sales, $212 million, or 2% of net sales, and $134 million, or 1% of net sales, respectively.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P106_S2	Our effective tax rate will change based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P106_S3	In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	The TCJA includes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that impacted our accounting and reporting for income taxes in the current year, including:
1001250_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	A reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a fiscal 2018 U.S. blended statutory income tax rate of 28.1%.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	A one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings ( Transition Tax ), which may be paid over an eight-year period.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	A remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	In addition, as a result of the Transition Tax, we established a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes in connection with the reversal of our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	(1) All periods ex clude the net impact on the effective tax rate of charges associated with restructuring and other activities and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	Fiscal 2018 was adjusted for the impact of the provisional adjustments resulting from the enactment of the TCJA.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P113_S1	Fiscal 2017 was adjusted for the impact of the tax law change in China and goodwill and other intangible asset impairments.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 increased approximately 2,130 basis points.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	The increase was primarily attributable to the impacts from the TCJA including the Transition Tax of approximately 1,770 basis points, the impact to U.S. net deferred tax assets resulting from the statutory tax rate reduction, including the enactment date remeasurement, of approximately 270 basis points, and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings of approximately 230 basis points.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P114_S2	Also contributing to the increase was the impact in the prior year of the tax law change in China which expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses and reduced the prior year tax rate by approximately 460 basis points.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P114_S3	Partially offsetting these increases was approximately 250 basis points due to the favorable impact of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P114_S4	The remaining change of approximately 350 basis points was primarily related to the favorable impact of the reduced U.S. statutory tax rate.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 decreased approximately 460 basis points due to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance (the China deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal ).
1001250_18_ITEM7_P115_S1	The deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance related to the accumulated carryforward of excess advertising and promotional expenses.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P115_S2	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a favorable change to the tax law in China was enacted that expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses, resulting in this change in realizability of the asset.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P115_S3	Also contributing to this decrease was a reduction in income tax reserve adjustments of approximately 100 basis points.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P120_S2	The tables provide reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P121_S0	As diluted net earnings per common share, as adjusted, is used as a measure of the Company s performance, we consider the impact of current and deferred income taxes when calculating the per-share impact of each of the reconciling items.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P122_S0	The following table reconciles the change in net sales by product category and geographic region, as reported, to the change in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation:

1001250_18_ITEM7_P124_S0	The following table reconciles the change in net sales by product category and geographic region, as reported, to the change in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation:
1001250_18_ITEM7_P125_S0	Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P125_S1	At June 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,181 million compared with $1,136 million at June 30, 2017.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P125_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P125_S3	To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P126_S0	In addition, we purchase short- and long-term investments pursuant to our cash investment strategy.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P126_S1	Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P126_S2	These investments are classified as available-for-sale and totaled $1,222 million and $1,498 million at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P127_S0	Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P127_S1	From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P127_S2	To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P128_S0	Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available-for-sale securities, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information technology enhancements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	The recently enacted TCJA resulted in the Transition Tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional U.S. federal income tax.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P129_S1	During fiscal 2018, we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings and continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P129_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances at June 30, 2018 include $1,068 million of cash and short- and long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P130_S0	We do not believe that continuing to reinvest our foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P130_S1	If these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P131_S0	The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P131_S1	Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P132_S1	Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P132_S2	Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P133_S1	As of August 17, 2018, our commercial paper is rated A-1 by Standard Poor s and P-1 by Moody s, and our long-term debt is rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard Poor s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody s.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) decreased to 43% at June 30, 2018 from 45% at June 30, 2017, primarily due to the increase in total equity reflecting higher net earnings, partially offset by higher treasury stock purchases.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	For further information regarding our current and long-term debt and available financing, see Item 8.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P135_S1	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 Debt .
1001250_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	The fiscal 2018 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2017 primarily reflected higher earnings before income taxes and an increase in accounts payable, primarily due to extended supplier payment terms.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P136_S1	Also contributing to the improvement was a decrease in other assets, reflecting the collection of taxes receivable resulting from the fiscal 2017 change to the tax law in China, and an increase in other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, due in part to an increase in accrued employee incentive compensation and a change in legal accruals in the prior year.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P136_S2	The impact of the TCJA, which lowered net earnings, contributed an increase of $351 million in other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, reflecting the Transition Tax, as well as $87 million, combined, relating to the decrease in U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the statutory tax rate reduction and withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	The Transition Tax may be paid over an eight-year period, of which $31 million is classified as short-term.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P137_S1	These charges did not have a material impact on our reported cash flows from operations as of June 30, 2018.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	The fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, a decrease in discretionary pension and post-retirement benefit contributions and a favorable change in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments and collections.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P138_S1	These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments, and other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, related to a change in legal accruals, accrued professional fees and accrued employee incentive compensation, partially offset by advertising and promotional accruals.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P139_S0	The overall change in cash flows from certain working capital components was impacted by our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	The fiscal 2018 decrease in net cash used for investing activities reflected cash paid in the fiscal 2017 second quarter related to the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, and lower purchases, net of proceeds, of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P140_S1	Partially offsetting these changes was an increase in capital expenditures, primarily related to counters.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	The fiscal 2017 increase in net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, partially offset by lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P142_S0	The fiscal 2018 change in net cash provided by (used for) financing activities primarily reflected the prior year issuance of the 2020 Senior Notes, 2027 Senior Notes and 2047 Senior Notes, partially offset by the repayment of the 5.55% Senior Notes due May 15, 2017.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P142_S1	The change also reflected higher treasury stock purchases, lower commercial paper borrowings and higher dividend payments in the current year.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	The fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by financing activities reflected the issuance of the 2020 Senior Notes, 2027 Senior Notes and 2047 Senior Notes, partially offset by the repayment of the 2017 Senior Notes.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P143_S1	The increase also reflected lower treasury stock purchases and higher commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by higher dividend payments.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	For a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during the year ended June 30, 2018 and through August 17, 2018, see Item 8.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	Several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P146_S1	For our domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan ( U.S. Qualified Plan ), we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P146_S2	For any future contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ( ERISA ) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions .
1001250_18_ITEM7_P147_S2	The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P148_S1	This strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P148_S2	For fiscal 2018 and 2017, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under ERISA regulations for the U.S. Qualified Plan.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P148_S3	In fiscal 2018, we made a discretionary cash contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan of $40 million.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P148_S4	As we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the United States during fiscal 2019.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	The following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and post-retirement plans:
1001250_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	Certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or earn-out provisions.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P150_S1	These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P150_S2	Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.

1001250_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments (Credit Risk) .
1001250_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P161_S1	To perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P161_S2	A hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $10 million and $26 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P161_S3	This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P162_S1	Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by approximately $24 million and $34 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	Our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P163_S1	It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P163_S2	We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2018 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).
1001250_18_ITEM7_P166_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P166_S2	These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company s financial condition.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	Our most critical accounting policies relate to goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	Management of the Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Assessment Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P170_S1	Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P170_S2	Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	When testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P171_S1	For fiscal 2018 and 2017, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P171_S2	This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P171_S3	For our other reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, a quantitative assessment was performed.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P171_S4	We engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	For further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets, see Item 8.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
1001250_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	Income Taxes We calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P174_S1	As the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P174_S2	The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P176_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P176_S1	We regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P176_S2	If our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P177_S0	We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P177_S1	The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P177_S2	We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P177_S3	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P177_S4	For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P178_S0	We classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P178_S1	Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P178_S2	If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P179_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the TCJA, which, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate statutory income tax rate and established a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P180_S0	In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, as of June 30, 2018, we recorded certain TCJA related provisional charges using available information and estimates.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P180_S1	Adjustments to the provisional charges will be recorded in the period in which those adjustments become reasonably estimable and/or the accounting is complete.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P180_S2	Such adjustments may result from, among other things, future guidance, interpretations and regulatory changes from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and/or various state and local tax jurisdictions.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P180_S3	We will complete this analysis no later than December 22, 2018.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P181_S0	For further discussion of our Income Taxes accounting policy, see Item 8.
1001250_18_ITEM7_P182_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
1001250_18_ITEM7_P183_S0	We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the SEC, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders.
