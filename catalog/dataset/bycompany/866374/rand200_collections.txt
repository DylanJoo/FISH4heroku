866374_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our business has been subject to seasonality primarily due to our mobile devices market and our consumer devices market, which historically exhibit particular strength toward the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Historically, the EMS industry experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elected to outsource some or all of their design, manufacturing, and distribution requirements.
866374_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	We have seen an increase in penetration of global OEM manufacturing requirements since the 2001 - 2002 technology downturn as more and more OEMs pursued the benefits of outsourcing rather than internal manufacturing.
866374_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	Due to the global economic crisis, which began in late calendar year 2007 and continued through the end of our fiscal year 2010, many of our OEM customers reduced their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing which negatively impacted our business.
866374_11_ITEM1_P8_S3	Beginning in the second half of our fiscal year 2010, we began seeing some positive signs that demand for our OEM customers' end products was improving, and this trend continued through the end of our 2011 fiscal year.
866374_11_ITEM1_P8_S4	We believe the EMS industry is firmly recovering from the last macroeconomic downturn and growth of the overall EMS industry for calendar 2010 is estimated to have been greater than 20%.

866374_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	We believe that scale is a significant competitive advantage, as our customers' solutions increasingly require cost structures and capabilities that can only be achieved through size and global reach.
866374_11_ITEM1_P58_S2	We are a leader in global procurement, purchasing approximately $23.5 billion of materials during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM1_P58_S3	As a result, we are able to use our worldwide supplier relationships to achieve advantageous pricing and supply chain flexibility for our OEM customers.
866374_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	We have established an extensive, integrated network of design, manufacturing and logistics facilities in the world's major electronics markets to serve the outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	Our extensive global network of facilities in 30 countries with approximately 176,000 employees gives us the ability to increase the competitiveness of our customers by simplifying their global product development processes while also delivering improved product quality with improved performance and accelerated time to market.
866374_11_ITEM1_P59_S2	Operating and executing this complex worldwide solutions system is a competitive advantage.
866374_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	We have an industry leading global design service offering with extensive product design engineering resources that provide global design services, products, and solutions to satisfy a wide array of customer requirements across all of our key markets.
866374_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	We combine our design and manufacturing services to provide end-to-end customized solutions that include services from design layout, through product industrialization and product development, including the manufacture of vertically-integrated components (such as camera modules) and complete products (such as cellular phones), which are then sold by our OEM customers under the OEMs' brand names.
866374_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	We offer a comprehensive range of worldwide supply chain services that simplify and improve the global product development process and provide meaningful time and cost savings to our OEM customers.
866374_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	Our broad based, vertically-integrated, end-to-end services enable us to cost effectively design, build, ship and service a complete packaged product.
866374_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	We believe that our vertically-integrated capabilities also help our customers improve product quality, manufacturability and performance, and reduce costs.
866374_11_ITEM1_P61_S3	We have expanded and enhanced our vertically-integrated service offering by adding capabilities in machining, flexible printed circuit boards, and power supplies, as well as by introducing new vertically-integrated capabilities in areas such as solar equipment, large format stamping and chargers.
866374_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	We have developed self-contained campuses that co-locate our manufacturing and logistics operations with our suppliers at a single, low-cost location.
866374_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	These industrial parks enhance our total supply chain management, while providing a low-cost, multi-technology solution for our customers.
866374_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	This approach increases the competitiveness of our customers by reducing logistical barriers and costs, improving communications, increasing flexibility, lowering transportation costs and reducing turnaround times.
866374_11_ITEM1_P62_S3	We have strategically established our large industrial parks in Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Malaysia, Mexico and Poland.
866374_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	In addition, we have other regional manufacturing operations situated in low-cost regions of the world to provide our customers with a wide array of manufacturing solutions and low manufacturing costs.
866374_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	As of March 31, 2011, approximately 74% of our manufacturing capacity was located in low-cost locations, such as Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia and Ukraine.
866374_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	We believe we are a global industry leader in low-cost production capabilities.
866374_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	We believe that maintaining our long-term relationships with key customers is a critical requirement for maintaining our market position, growth and profitability.
866374_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	We believe that our ability to maintain and grow these customer relationships results from our ability to continuously create value that increases our customers' competitiveness.
866374_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	We achieve this through our broad range of vertically-integrated service offerings and solutions, and our market-focused approach, which allows us to provide innovative thinking to all of the manufacturing and related services that we provide to our customers.
866374_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	We continue to receive numerous service and quality awards that further validate the success of these programs.
866374_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our customers include many of the world's leading technology companies.
866374_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	We have focused on establishing long-term relationships with our customers and have been successful in expanding our relationships to incorporate additional product lines and services.
866374_11_ITEM1_P65_S2	In fiscal year 2011, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 52% of net sales.
866374_11_ITEM1_P65_S3	Our largest customer during fiscal year 2011 was Research in Motion, which accounted for more than 10% of net sales.
866374_11_ITEM1_P65_S4	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2011.
866374_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	The following table lists in alphabetical order a representative sample of our largest customers in fiscal year 2011 and the products of those customers for which we provide EMS services:
866374_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	Although we obtain firm purchase orders from our customers, OEM customers typically do not make firm orders for delivery of products more than 30 to 90 days in advance.
866374_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	In addition, OEM customers may reschedule or cancel firm orders based upon contractual arrangements.
866374_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	Therefore, we do not believe that the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales.
866374_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	The EMS market is extremely competitive and includes many companies, several of which have achieved substantial market share.
866374_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	We compete against numerous domestic and foreign EMS providers, as well as our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	We face particular competition from Asian based competitors, including Taiwanese ODM suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	We compete with different companies depending on the type of service we are providing or the geographic area in which an activity takes place.
866374_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the EMS market are: quality and range of services; design and technological capabilities; cost; location of facilities; responsiveness and flexibility.
866374_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	Our corporate social responsibility practices focus on global human rights, global environmental conditions, business ethics, and the health and safety of all stakeholders.
866374_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	We do this with controlled business processes, thus ensuring that our business is conducted in a manner that goes beyond compliance alone.
866374_11_ITEM1_P70_S2	We operate programs, including compliance audits and compliance capability building programs, that focus on driving continuous improvements in social, ethical, and environmental compliance throughout all of our global operating units in accordance with our Code of Conduct.
866374_11_ITEM1_P70_S3	As a guide to achieve this end, Flextronics looks at principles, policies, and standards as prescribed by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition ("EICC"), a worldwide association of electronics companies committed to promoting an industry code of conduct for global electronics supply chains to improve working and environmental conditions.
866374_11_ITEM1_P70_S4	Flextronics is a founding member of the EICC coalition.
866374_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	Being a good corporate citizen does not mean that we should merely conform to the standards.
866374_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	We extend beyond meeting responsibilities by offering a wide range of programs and initiatives that engage our internal and external communities.
866374_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	creating a difference to the people in the community in which we operate.
866374_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	We intend to continue to invest in these global communities through grant-making, financial contributions, volunteer work, support programs and by donating resources.
866374_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	As of March 31, 2011, our global workforce totaled approximately 176,000 employees.
866374_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by work councils.
866374_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	We have never experienced a significant work stoppage or strike, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
866374_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees.
866374_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	The loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business, results of operations and business prospects.
866374_11_ITEM1_P74_S2	To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel.
866374_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
866374_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	We have infrastructure in place to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.
866374_11_ITEM1_P75_S2	We do not believe that costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating results, or competitive position.
866374_11_ITEM1_P75_S3	In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third-party sites.
866374_11_ITEM1_P75_S4	We engage environmental consulting firms to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities of our ongoing operations, historical disposal activities and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements.
866374_11_ITEM1_P75_S5	We determine the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the range of possible costs in light of information currently available.
866374_11_ITEM1_P75_S6	The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations, the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by us at our operating facilities, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters.
866374_11_ITEM1_P75_S7	While no material exposures have been identified to date that we are aware of, there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known.
866374_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	EU Directive REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemicals), and China RoHS entitled, Management Methods for Controlling Pollution for Electronic Information Products ("EIPs").
866374_11_ITEM1_P76_S2	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States.
866374_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	Our business requires close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to mitigate risk of non-compliance.
866374_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as the regulations.
866374_11_ITEM1_P77_S2	These programs vary from collecting compliance data from our Flextronics owned suppliers to full laboratory testing, and we require our supply chain to comply.
866374_11_ITEM1_P77_S3	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	In the case of WEEE, although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations.
866374_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	We own or license various United States and foreign patents relating to a variety of technologies.
866374_11_ITEM1_P79_S1	For certain of our proprietary processes, we rely on trade secret protection.
866374_11_ITEM1_P79_S2	We also have registered our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the United States and other countries throughout the world.
866374_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of our intellectual property was not material.
866374_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	Although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it, from time to time third parties do assert patent infringement claims against us or our customers.
866374_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	In addition, we are increasingly providing design and engineering services to our customers and designing and making our own products.
866374_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	As a consequence of these activities, our customers are requiring us to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses.
866374_11_ITEM1_P81_S3	If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_11_ITEM1_P81_S4	Such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor.
866374_11_ITEM1_P81_S5	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome.
866374_11_ITEM1_P81_S6	We also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services.
866374_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	Refer to Note 13, "Segment Reporting," to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for financial information about our geographic areas.
866374_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	We make available through our Internet website the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
866374_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	We were incorporated in the Republic of Singapore in May 1990.
866374_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	Our principal corporate office is located at 2 Changi South Lane, Singapore 486123.
866374_11_ITEM1_P84_S2	Our U.S. corporate headquarters is located at 847 Gibraltar Drive, Milpitas, CA, 95035.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We depend on industries that continually produce technologically advanced products with short life cycles and our business would be adversely affected if our customers' products are not successful or if our customers lose market share.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We derive our revenues from customers in the following product areas:
866374_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Mobile communication devices, which includes handsets operating on a number of different platforms such as GSM, CDMA, TDMA and WCDMA; Computing, which includes products such as all-in-one PC desktops, notebook and netbook computers, tablets, enterprise storage devices and servers; Consumer digital devices, which includes products such as home entertainment equipment, game consoles, game peripherals, printers, copiers and cameras; Industrial, Semiconductor Capital Equipment, Clean Technology, Aerospace and Defense, and White Goods, which includes products such as home appliances, industrial meters, in-flight entertainment, robotics, bar code readers, self-service kiosks, solar and wind energy market equipment and test equipment; Automotive and Marine, which includes products such as navigation instruments, radar components, electric vehicles, and instrument panel and radio components; and Medical devices, which includes products such as drug delivery, diagnostic, telemedicine, medical equipment and disposable medical devices.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Factors affecting any of these industries in general, or our customers in particular, could adversely impact us.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	rapid changes in technology, evolving industry standards and requirements for continuous improvement in products and services result in short product life cycles; demand for our customers' products may be seasonal; our customers may fail to successfully market their products, and our customers' products may fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance; our customers may experience dramatic market share shifts in demand which may cause them to exit the business; and there may be recessionary periods in our customers' markets, such as the recent global economic downturn.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and the inherent difficulties involved in responding to these demands could harm our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	As a provider of electronics design and manufacturing services and components, we must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround time for our customers.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and we often experience reduced lead times in customer orders which may be less than the lead time we require to procure necessary components and materials.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers have harmed, and may continue to harm, our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and deliver for these customers, by causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and by lowering our asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Additionally, current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our capabilities against other providers as well as against the merits of manufacturing products themselves.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our business would be adversely affected if OEMs decide to perform these functions internally or transfer the business to another provider.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of our customers.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In that regard, we must make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, setting production schedules, making component procurement commitments, and allocating personnel and other resources, based on our estimates of our customers' requirements.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production or require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to achieve cost or other objectives.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These demands stress our resources and reduce our margins.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands, and transfers from one facility to another can result in inefficiencies and costs due to excess capacity in one facility and corresponding capacity constraints at another.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Due to many of our costs and operating expenses being relatively fixed, customer order fluctuations, deferrals and transfers of demand from one facility to another, as described above, have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past and we may experience such effects in the future.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our industry is extremely competitive; if we are not able to continue to provide competitive services, we may lose business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We compete with a number of different companies, depending on the type of service we provide or the location of our operations.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	For example, we compete with major global EMS providers, other smaller EMS companies that have a regional or product-specific focus, and ODMs with respect to some of the services that we provide.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We also compete with our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our industry is extremely competitive, many of our competitors have achieved substantial market share and some may have lower cost structures or greater design, manufacturing, financial or other resources than we do.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We face particular competition from Asian-based competitors, including Taiwanese ODM suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P11_S5	If we are unable to provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at lower cost than the other companies in our market, our net sales could decline.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a decline in sales to any of these customers could adversely affect our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Sales to our ten largest customers represent a significant percentage of our net sales.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 52%, 47% and 50% of net sales in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our largest customer during fiscal 2011 was Research In Motion, which accounted for more than 10% of net sales.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2011.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our largest customer during fiscal year 2010 was Hewlett-Packard and our largest customer during fiscal year 2009 was Sony-Ericsson, each of which accounted for more than 10% of net sales in the respective fiscal year.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P13_S5	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal years 2010 or 2009.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our principal customers have varied from year to year.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These customers may experience dramatic declines in their market shares or competitive position, due to economic or other forces, that may cause them to reduce their purchases from us or, in some cases, result in the termination of their relationship with us.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Significant reductions in sales to any of these customers, or the loss of major customers, would materially harm our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we are not able to timely replace expired, canceled or reduced contracts with new business, our revenues could be harmed.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our components business is dependent on our ability to quickly launch world-class components products, and our investment in development, together with start-up and integration costs necessary to achieve quick launches of world-class components products, may adversely affect our margins and profitability.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our components business, which includes rigid and flexible printed circuit board fabrication, camera modules, power supplies and display and touch design manufacturing, is part of our strategy to improve our competitive position and to grow our future margins, profitability and shareholder returns by expanding our vertical-integration capabilities.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The success of our components business is dependent on our ability to design and introduce world-class components that have performance characteristics which are suitable for a broad market and that offer significant price and/or performance advantages over competitive products.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	To create these world class components offerings, we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our components capabilities, in resources such as research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, facility expansions and personnel requirements.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We may not be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance for any of our components offerings in any of our current or target markets.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The success of our components business will also depend upon the level of market acceptance of our customers' end products, which incorporate our components, and over which we have no control.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition, OEMs often require unique configurations or custom designs which must be developed and integrated in the OEM's product well before the product is launched by the OEM.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Thus, there is often substantial lead time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized component and the commencement of volume shipments of the component to the OEM.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	As a result, we may make substantial investments in the development and customization of products for our customers and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not accept the customized component.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Even if our customers accept the customized component, if our customers do not purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our achievement of anticipated levels of profitability in our components business is also dependent on our ability to achieve efficiencies in our manufacturing as well as to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our OEM customers.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability in our components business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may be adversely affected by shortages of required electronic components.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	From time to time, we have experienced shortages of some of the electronic components that we use.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	These shortages can result from strong demand for those components or from problems experienced by suppliers.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	These unanticipated component shortages could result in curtailed production or delays in production, which may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a reduction in sales, increase in inventory levels and costs, and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Component shortages may also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P21_S5	As a result, component shortages could adversely affect our operating results.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to incorporate changes in component costs into the selling prices for our products.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our supply chain may also be impacted by other events outside our control, including macroeconomic events, political crises or natural or environmental occurrences.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Component shortages impacted our results during the second half of fiscal year 2010 and during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The supply constraints were broad based, but the impact was most evident with respect to connectors, capacitors, LCD panels and memory (both DRAM and Flash).
866374_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	abate during the second quarter of fiscal 2011, and supplies had normalized by the end of the third quarter.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We continue to monitor the effects on our business of the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan, as a large number of suppliers to the global market for semiconductors and other electronic components are located in Japan and the disaster may therefore result in disruptions to our supply chain.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our margins and profitability may be adversely affected due to substantial investments, start-up and production ramping costs in our design services.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	As part of our strategy to enhance our vertically-integrated, end-to-end service offerings, we have expanded and continue to expand our design and engineering capabilities.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Providing these services can expose us to different or greater potential risks than those we face when providing our manufacturing services.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Although we enter into contracts with our design services customers, we may design and develop products for these customers prior to receiving a purchase order or other firm commitment from them.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We are required to make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Even if our customers accept our designs, if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our design activities often require that we purchase inventory for initial production runs before we have a purchase commitment from a customer.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Even after we have a contract with a customer with respect to a product, these contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any particular volume of purchases.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P26_S5	These contracts can generally be terminated on short notice.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P26_S6	In addition, some of the products we design and develop must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some must receive government certifications.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P26_S7	If we fail to obtain these approvals or certifications on a timely basis, we would be unable to sell these products, which would harm our sales, profitability and reputation.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Due to the increased risks associated with our design services offerings, we may not be able to achieve a high enough level of sales for this business, and the significant investments in research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, patent applications, facility expansion and recruitment that it requires, to be profitable.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The initial costs of investing in the resources necessary to expand our design and engineering capabilities, and in particular to support our design services offerings, have historically adversely affected our profitability, and may continue to do so as we continue to make investments in these capabilities.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In addition, we agree to certain product price limitations and cost reduction targets in order to achieve anticipated margins and profitable operations.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Inflationary and other increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor required to produce the products have occurred and may recur from time to time.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Also, the production ramps for these programs are typically significant and negatively impact our margin in early stages as the manufacturing volumes are lower and result in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We may not be able to reduce costs, incorporate changes in costs into the selling prices of our products, or increase operating efficiencies as we ramp production of our products, which would adversely affect our margins and our results of operations.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for medical devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	As a medical device manufacturer, we have additional compliance requirements.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring by the FDA.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance with QSR or other FDA regulations, and the Company does not address the observation adequately to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA may take action against us.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	FDA actions may include issuing a letter of inspectional observations, issuing a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the Company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, issuing an import detention on products entering the U.S. from an offshore facility, or shutting down a manufacturing facility.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P31_S4	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In the European Union ("EU"), we are required to maintain certain standardized certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections to obtain and maintain these certifications.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Continued noncompliance to the EU regulations could stop the flow of products into the EU from us or from our customers.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In China, the Safe Food and Drug Administration controls and regulates the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We must comply with the regulatory laws applicable to medical device manufactures or our ability to manufacture products in China could be impacted.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In Japan, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws regulate the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	These regulations also require that subcontractors manufacturing products intended for sale in Japan register with authorities and submit to regulatory audits.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Other Asian countries where we operate have similar laws regarding the regulation of medical device manufacturing.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to risks of international operations.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The distances between the Americas, Asia and Europe create a number of logistical and communications challenges for us.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	These challenges include managing operations across multiple time zones, directing the manufacture and delivery of products across distances, coordinating procurement of components and raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations, and coordinating the activities and decisions of the core management team, which is based in a number of different countries.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Facilities in several different locations may be involved at different stages of the production of a single product, leading to additional logistical difficulties.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Because our manufacturing operations are located in a number of countries throughout the Americas, Asia and Europe, we are subject to the risks of changes in economic and political conditions in those countries, including:
866374_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	a potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The attractiveness of our services to U.S. customers can be affected by changes in U.S. trade policies, such as most favored nation status and trade preferences for some Asian countries.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In addition, some countries in which we operate, such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Mexico, Malaysia and Poland, have experienced periods of slow or negative growth, high inflation, significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Furthermore, in countries such as China and Mexico, governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy, and their actions could have a significant effect on us.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure, including lack of adequate power and water supplies, transportation, raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In addition, we may encounter labor disruptions and rising labor costs, in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Any increase in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P39_S6	To date, we have not been materially impacted by these labor issues.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In some countries, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert our cash distributions to U.S. dollars or other freely convertible currencies, or to move funds from our accounts in these countries.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Furthermore, the central bank of any of these countries may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to approve distributions to foreign investors.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Another significant legal risk resulting from our international operations is compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar local laws of the countries in which we do business, which prohibits covered companies from making payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our Code of Business Conduct prohibits anti-corruption on a global basis and precludes us from offering or giving anything of value to a government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, to win a business advantage or to improperly influence a decision regarding Flextronics.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents will refrain from taking actions in violation of this and our related anti-corruption policies and procedures.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The success of certain of our activities depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We retain certain intellectual property rights to some of the technologies that we develop as part of our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	As the level of our engineering and design activities increases, the extent to which we rely on rights to intellectual property incorporated into products is increasing.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The measures we have taken to prevent unauthorized use of our technology may not be successful.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P43_S3	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties, as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our customers.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In addition, our customers are increasingly requiring us to indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are subject to the risk of increased income taxes.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We have structured our operations in a manner designed to maximize income in countries where:
866374_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	tax incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment; or income tax rates are low.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	A number of countries in which we are located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	For example, on March 16, 2007, the Chinese government passed a new unified enterprise income tax law which became effective on January 1, 2008.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Among other things, the new law cancels many income tax incentives previously applicable to our subsidiaries in China.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Under the new law, the tax rates applicable to the operations of most of our subsidiaries in China will be increased to 25%.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P49_S5	The new law provides a transition rule which increases the tax rate to 25% over a 5-year period.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P49_S6	The new law also increased the standard withholding rate on earnings distributions to between 5% and 10% depending on the residence of the shareholder.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P49_S7	The ultimate effect of these and other changes in Chinese tax laws on our overall tax rate will be affected by, among other things, our China income, the manner in which China interprets, implements and applies the new tax provisions, and by our ability to qualify for any exceptions or new incentives.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P49_S8	Similarly, one of our Malaysian tax holidays is set to expire on January 31, 2012.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P49_S9	We are currently in negotiations with the Malaysian government to extend the holiday for an additional five year period.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P49_S10	Our ability to qualify for the extension will depend on, among other things, our anticipated investment and expansion in Malaysia and the manner in which Malaysia interprets the requirements for an extension or a new incentive.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions in the United States and around the world.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	However, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax provision, operating results, financial position and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	If our products or components contain defects, demand for our services may decline and we may be exposed to product liability and product warranty liability.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation, and expose us to product liability or product warranty claims.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Product liability claims may include liability for personal injury or property damage.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Product warranty claims may include liability to pay for the recall, repair or replacement of a product or component.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Although we generally allocate liability for these claims in our contracts with our customers, increasingly we are unsuccessful in allocating such liability and even where we have allocated liability to our customers, our customers may not have the resources to, satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product or component for which they have assumed responsibility.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	If we design, engineer or manufacture a product or component that is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could spend a significant amount of money to resolve the claim.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In addition, product liability and product recall insurance coverage are expensive and may not be available with respect to all of our services offerings on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P55_S2	A successful product liability or product warranty claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied, limited or is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	If we do not effectively manage changes in our operations, our business may be harmed; we have taken substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may need to take material restructuring charges in the future.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In recent years, we have experienced growth in our business through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	However, our business also has been negatively impacted by the recent adverse global economic conditions.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The expansion of our business, as well as business contractions and other changes in our customers' requirements, have in the past, and may in the future, require that we adjust our business and cost structures, including by incurring restructuring charges.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Restructuring activities involve reductions in our workforce at some locations and closure of certain facilities.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P57_S4	All of these changes have in the past placed, and may in the future place, considerable strain on our management control systems and resources, including decision support, accounting management, information systems and facilities.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P57_S5	If we do not properly manage our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures to manage our employees, our business could be harmed.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In recent years, we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations through a series of restructuring activities, which were intended to realign our global capacity and infrastructure with demand by our OEM customers and thereby improve our operational efficiency.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	These activities included reducing excess workforce and capacity, transitioning manufacturing to lower-cost locations and eliminating redundant facilities, and consolidating and eliminating certain administrative facilities.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We recognized restructuring charges of approximately $107.5 million and $179.8 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	We may be required to take additional charges in the future to align our operations and cost structures with global economic conditions, market demands, cost competitiveness, and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers' production requirements.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	We may consolidate certain manufacturing facilities or transfer certain of our operations to lower cost geographies.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P59_S3	If we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Additionally, there are other potential risks associated with our restructurings that could adversely affect us, such as delays encountered with the finalization and implementation of the restructuring activities, work stoppages, and the failure to achieve targeted cost savings.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our operating costs.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our manufacturing operations and industrial parks are located in lower cost regions of the world, such as Asia, Eastern Europe and Mexico; however, most of our purchase and sale transactions are denominated in United States dollars, Japanese yen or euros.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in the functional currencies of our fixed cost overhead or our supply base relative to the currencies in which we conduct transactions.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors, including changes in a country's political and economic policies.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Volatility in the functional and non-functional currencies of our entities and the United States dollar could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	receivables, and payables of our operating entities.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As part of our currency hedging strategy, we use financial instruments, primarily forward purchase and swap contracts, to hedge our United States dollar and other currency commitments in order to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on current assets and liabilities.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P63_S2	If our hedging activities are not successful or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We are also exposed to risks related to the valuation of the Chinese currency relative to other foreign currencies.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The Chinese currency is the renminbi ("RMB").
866374_11_ITEM1A_P65_S1	A significant increase in the value of the RMB could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows by increasing both our manufacturing costs and the costs of our local supply base.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We depend on our executive officers and skilled management personnel.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Generally our employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We will need to recruit and retain skilled management personnel and if we are not able to do so, our business could be harmed.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P67_S4	In addition, in connection with expanding our design services offerings, we must attract and retain experienced design engineers.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P67_S5	There is substantial competition in our industry for highly skilled employees.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P67_S6	Our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our design services offerings, which could adversely affect our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our failure to comply with environmental laws could adversely affect our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including regulations governing the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used in our manufacturing processes.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the recyclability of products, the materials that may be included in products, and our obligations to dispose of these products after end users have finished with them.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Additionally, we may be exposed to liability to our customers relating to the materials that may be included in the components that we procure for our customers' products.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Any violation or alleged violation by us of environmental laws could subject us to significant costs, fines or other penalties.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We are subject to the European Union ("EU") directives, including the Restrictions on Hazardous Substances Directive ("RoHS"), the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE") as well as the EU's Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH") regulation.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Also of note is China's Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products regulation, commonly referred to as "China RoHS", which restricts the importation into and production within China of electrical equipment containing certain hazardous materials.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P70_S4	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as applicable regulations.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P71_S1	These programs vary from collecting compliance data from our suppliers to full laboratory testing, and we require our supply chain to comply.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P71_S3	In the case of WEEE, the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P71_S4	However, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their obligations under WEEE.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	If more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed, or the results of future testing and analyses at our current or former operating facilities indicate that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the air, ground and/or water, we may be subject to additional liability.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Additional environmental matters may arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations or adequately address contaminated sites could limit our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to incur significant expenses, which would harm our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our business and operations could be adversely impacted by climate change initiatives.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Concern over climate change has led to international legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to seasonal demand.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Two of our significant end markets are the mobile devices market and the consumer devices market.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	These markets exhibit particular strength toward the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P76_S2	As a result, we have historically experienced stronger revenues in our third fiscal quarter as compared to our other fiscal quarters.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P76_S3	Economic or other factors leading to diminished orders in the end of the calendar year could harm our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We may encounter difficulties with acquisitions, which could harm our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We have completed numerous acquisitions of businesses and we may acquire additional businesses in the future.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Any future acquisitions may require additional equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, or additional debt financing, which could increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P78_S3	As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P79_S2	The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P79_S3	In addition, the integration of acquired businesses may require that we incur significant restructuring charges.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including:
866374_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business; and exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	These and other factors have harmed, and in the future could harm, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our strategic relationships with major customers create risks.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	In the past, we have completed numerous strategic transactions with OEM customers.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Under these arrangements, we generally acquire inventory, equipment and other assets from the OEM, and lease or acquire their manufacturing facilities, while simultaneously entering into multi-year supply agreements for the production of their products.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P84_S2	We may pursue these OEM divestiture transactions in the future.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P84_S3	These arrangements entered into with divesting OEMs typically involve many risks, including the following:
866374_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	we may need to pay a purchase price to the divesting OEMs that exceeds the value we ultimately may realize from the future business of the OEM; the integration of the acquired assets and facilities into our business may be time-consuming and costly, including the incurrence of restructuring charges; we, rather than the divesting OEM, bear the risk of excess capacity at the facility; we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies at the facility; we may be unable to meet the expectations of the OEM as to volume, product quality, timeliness and cost reductions; our supply agreements with the OEMs generally do not require any minimum volumes of purchase by the OEMs, and the actual volume of purchases may be less than anticipated; and if demand for the OEMs' products declines, the OEM may reduce its volume of purchases, and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other OEMs.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P86_S1	In addition, these strategic arrangements have not, and in the future may not, result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings per share.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P87_S0	As of March 31, 2011, our total debt was approximately $2.2 billion.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P87_S1	This level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Weak global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and access to capital markets.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which our customers compete.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and capital markets resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and high volatility in credit, fixed income and equity markets.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P91_S0	If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other corporate purposes.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We provide EMS services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P93_S1	If our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our products from these customers could decline.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty we could have difficulty sourcing supply necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P93_S3	If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivable are outstanding.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P94_S0	The market price of our ordinary shares is volatile.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P95_S0	The stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of companies, including technology companies.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P95_S1	These fluctuations have often been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P95_S2	The market for our ordinary shares has been and may in the future be subject to similar volatility.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Factors such as fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of technological innovations or events affecting other companies in the electronics industry, currency fluctuations, general market fluctuations, and macro economic conditions may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P96_S0	If our security systems and governance policies are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We have implemented security systems and governance policies with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our customers' and our suppliers' confidential information.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of these security systems and governance policies which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or unauthorized use of the information we are trying to protect.
866374_11_ITEM1A_P97_S2	If unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow.
866374_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facilities consist of a global network of industrial parks, regional manufacturing operations, and design, engineering and product introduction centers, providing over 25.1 million square feet of productive capacity as of March 31, 2011.

866374_11_ITEM5_P10_S0	Singapore does not impose a withholding tax on dividends.
866374_11_ITEM5_P10_S1	All dividends are tax exempt to shareholders.
866374_11_ITEM5_P11_S0	Under current Singapore tax law there is no tax on capital gains, thus any profits from the disposal of shares are not taxable in Singapore unless the gains arising from the disposal of shares are income in nature and subject to tax, especially if they arise from activities which the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore regards as the carrying on of a trade or business in Singapore (in which case, the profits on the sale would be taxable as trade profits rather than capital gains).
866374_11_ITEM5_P12_S0	Shareholders who apply, or who are required to apply, the Singapore Financial Reporting Standard 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement ("FRS 39") for the purposes of Singapore income tax may be required to recognize gains or losses (not being gains or losses in the nature of capital) in accordance with the provisions of FRS 39 (as modified by the applicable provisions of Singapore income tax law) even though no sale or disposal of shares is made.
866374_11_ITEM5_P13_S0	There is no stamp duty payable for holding shares, and no duty is payable on the acquisition of newly-issued shares.
866374_11_ITEM5_P14_S0	When existing shares are acquired in Singapore, a stamp duty is payable on the instrument of transfer of the shares at the rate of two Singapore dollars ("S$") for every S$1,000 of the market value of the shares.
866374_11_ITEM5_P14_S1	The stamp duty is borne by the purchaser unless there is an agreement to the contrary.
866374_11_ITEM5_P14_S2	If the instrument of transfer is executed outside of Singapore, the stamp duty must be paid only if the instrument of transfer is received in Singapore.
866374_11_ITEM5_P15_S0	The estate duty was abolished for deaths occurring on or after February 15, 2008.
866374_11_ITEM5_P15_S1	For deaths prior to February 15, 2008 the following rules apply:
866374_11_ITEM5_P16_S0	If an individual who is not domiciled in Singapore dies on or after January 1, 2002, no estate tax is payable in Singapore on any of our shares held by the individual.
866374_11_ITEM5_P17_S0	If property passing upon the death of an individual domiciled in Singapore includes our shares, Singapore estate duty is payable to the extent that the value of the shares aggregated with any other assets subject to Singapore estate duty exceeds S$600,000.
866374_11_ITEM5_P17_S1	Unless other exemptions apply to the other assets, for example, the separate exemption limit for residential properties, any excess beyond S$600,000 will be taxed at 5% on the first S$12,000,000 of the individual's chargeable assets and thereafter at 10%.
866374_11_ITEM5_P18_S0	An individual shareholder who is a U.S. citizen or resident (for U.S. estate tax purposes) will have the value of the shares included in the individual's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes.
866374_11_ITEM5_P18_S1	An individual shareholder generally will be entitled to a tax credit against the shareholder's U.S. estate tax to the extent the individual shareholder actually pays Singapore estate tax on the value of the shares; however, such tax credit is generally limited to the percentage of the U.S. estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the value of the shares included in the shareholder's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes, adjusted further by a pro rata apportionment of available exemptions.
866374_11_ITEM5_P18_S2	Individuals who are domiciled in Singapore should consult their own tax advisors regarding the Singapore estate tax consequences of their investment.
866374_11_ITEM5_P19_S0	There is no reciprocal income tax treaty between the U.S. and Singapore regarding withholding taxes on dividends and capital gains.
866374_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	These historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future.
866374_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) On October 1, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Solectron, a provider of value-added electronics manufacturing and supply chain services to OEMs.
866374_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	The results of Solectron's operations were included in the Company's consolidated financial results beginning on the acquisition date.
866374_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) Restructuring charges incurred during the 2010 and 2009 fiscal years were primarily intended to rationalize the Company's global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in response to weakened macroeconomic conditions and decline in demand from our OEM customers.
866374_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	Restructuring charges incurred during the 2008 fiscal year were primarily in connection with the acquisition and integration of Solectron.
866374_11_ITEM6_P2_S2	Restructuring charges incurred during the 2007 fiscal year were primarily in connection with the consolidation and closure of multiple manufacturing facilities.
866374_11_ITEM6_P2_S3	(3) The Company recognized a charge of $30.0 million during fiscal year 2008 for the write-off of certain intangible asset licenses due to technological obsolescence.
866374_11_ITEM6_P2_S4	(4) The Company recognized a charge to impair goodwill as a result of a significant decline in its share value driven by weakened macroeconomic conditions that contributed to a decrease in market multiples and estimated discounted cash flows.
866374_11_ITEM6_P2_S5	(5) During fiscal year 2011, the Company recognized a $13.2 million loss associated with the early redemption of the 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes and an $11.7 million loss in connection with the divestiture of certain international entities.
866374_11_ITEM6_P2_S6	In fiscal year 2011, the Company recognized a gain of $18.6 million associated with a sale of an equity investment that was previously fully impaired.

866374_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	In addition, new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business.
866374_11_ITEM7_P1_S4	Accordingly, our future results may differ materially from historical results or from those discussed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
866374_11_ITEM7_P1_S5	Given these risks and uncertainties, the reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
866374_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a leading provider of advanced design and electronics manufacturing services ("EMS") to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") of a broad range of products in the following markets: infrastructure; mobile communication devices; computing; consumer digital devices; industrial, semiconductor capital equipment, clean technology, aerospace and defense, and white goods; automotive and marine; and medical devices.
866374_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	We provide a full range of vertically-integrated global supply chain services through which we can design, build, ship and service a complete packaged product for our customers.
866374_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	Customers leverage our services to meet their product requirements throughout the entire product life cycle.
866374_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	Our vertically-integrated service offerings include: design services; rigid and flexible printed circuit board fabrication; systems assembly and manufacturing; after sales services; and multiple component product offerings.
866374_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Historically, the EMS industry experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elected to outsource some or all of their design and manufacturing requirements.
866374_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	We have seen an increase in the penetration of the global OEM manufacturing requirements since the 2001 - 2002 technology downturn as more and more OEMs pursued the benefits of outsourcing rather than internal manufacturing.
866374_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	In the second half of fiscal 2009, we experienced dramatically deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and demand for our customers' products slowed in all of the industries we serve.
866374_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	This global economic crisis, and related decline in demand for our customers' products, put pressure on certain of our OEM customers' cost structures and caused them to reduce their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing requirements.
866374_11_ITEM7_P3_S4	Beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2010, we began seeing some positive signs that demand for our OEM customers' end products was improving, and this trend continued through the end of our 2011 fiscal year.
866374_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are one of the world's largest EMS providers, with revenues of $28.7 billion in fiscal year 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	As of March 31, 2011, our total manufacturing capacity was approximately 25.1 million square feet.
866374_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	We design, build, ship, and service electronics products for our customers through a network of facilities in 30 countries across four continents.
866374_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	We have established an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world's major electronics markets (Asia, the Americas and Europe) in order to serve the growing outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_11_ITEM7_P4_S4	In fiscal year 2011, our net sales in Asia, the Americas and Europe represented approximately 52%, 29% and 19%, respectively, of our total net sales, based on the location of the manufacturing site.
866374_11_ITEM7_P4_S5	The following tables set forth net sales and net property and equipment, by country, based on the location of our manufacturing sites:
866374_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	We believe that the combination of our extensive design and engineering services, significant scale and global presence, vertically-integrated end-to-end services, advanced supply chain management, industrial campuses in low-cost geographic areas and operational track record provide us with a competitive advantage in the market for designing, manufacturing and servicing electronics products for leading multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Through these services and facilities, we offer our OEM customers the ability to simplify their global product development, manufacturing process, and after sales services, and enable them to achieve meaningful time to market and cost savings.
866374_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including the following:
866374_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	changes in the macroeconomic environment and related changes in consumer demand; the mix of the manufacturing services we are providing, the number and size of new manufacturing programs, the degree to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity, seasonal demand, shortages of components and other factors; the effects on our business when our customers are not successful in marketing their products, or when their products do not gain widespread commercial acceptance; our increased components offerings which have required that we make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products; our ability to achieve commercially viable production yields and to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our OEM customers; our increased design service business offering and related investments and start-up and production ramping costs; effect on our business due to our customers' products having short product life cycles; our customers' ability to cancel or delay orders or change production quantities; our customers' decision to choose internal manufacturing instead of outsourcing for their product requirements; our exposure to financially troubled customers; and integration of acquired businesses and facilities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	We recognized substantial revenue and profit growth during fiscal 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	We believe that we finished the year in a healthy financial and competitive position driven in part by the success in our diversified business model.
866374_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	The overall improvement in the macroeconomic environment during fiscal 2011 and the success in booking new product orders for our array of key customers led to increased demand for our OEM customers' ends products across all of our major markets.
866374_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	our sales growth during the year was organic, as the impact from acquisitions was minimal.
866374_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Net sales during fiscal year 2011 totaled $28.7 billion, representing an increase of $4.6 billion, or 19%, compared to fiscal year 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our fiscal 2011 gross profit totaled $1.6 billion, representing an increase of $367.3 million, or 30%, compared to fiscal 2010 driven primarily by increased sales, better facility utilization, cost controls, and the avoidance of any meaningful restructuring costs.
866374_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	Our net income of $596.2 million improved significantly compared to $18.6 million in fiscal 2010 reflecting the improvements in sales and gross margin noted above as well as increased leverage of our selling, general, and administrative expenses and decreased net interest expenses due to lower borrowing costs and debt repayments during the fiscal year.
866374_11_ITEM7_P9_S4	Our diluted earnings per share was $0.75 for fiscal 2011 compared to $0.02 in fiscal 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our cash provided by operations increased approximately $58.4 million to $857.3 million for fiscal year 2011 compared with $798.9 million for fiscal year 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Working capital increased by $221.5 million in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of increases in inventory, resulting from our increased production and anticipated continued growth, and increases in other current assets resulting from increases in our deferred purchase price receivable associated with our asset backed securitization programs.
866374_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	These increases were partially offset by increases in our accounts payables and other current liabilities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	Our average net working capital, defined as accounts receivable plus the deferred purchase price receivable from our asset-backed securitization programs plus inventory less accounts payable, as a percentage of annual sales was approximately 4.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 5.0% for fiscal 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	Our free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment, was $463.5 million for fiscal 2011 compared to $622.5 million for fiscal 2010, due in part to increased purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds for disposals, to support our sales growth.
866374_11_ITEM7_P10_S5	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $641.7 million during fiscal 2011 and included a repurchase of approximately 65.4 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of $400.4 million, including accrued expenses.
866374_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	We experienced significant volume increases in our component product solution services throughout fiscal year 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	As a result of this steep growth and other challenges faced by our component product solution services, our aggregate results for these services have been performing at below optimal levels.
866374_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our manufacturing efficiencies and production yields continued to improve and during fiscal year 2011 our component product solution services made progress reducing their aggregate operating losses.
866374_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	We are encouraged by the increased demand for these product solutions and the successful achievement of acceptance in the market, and we remain intensely focused on further improving our manufacturing efficiencies and thus our future margins and profitability.
866374_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	Our component product solution services, on a combined basis, accounted for less than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	In addition, during fiscal year 2011 our high volume computing design services offering experienced acute inflationary pressures, principally around raw materials and labor, which was widespread across the industry in which it competes.
866374_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	We also experienced significant volume increases as we ramped production for various new programs throughout fiscal year 2011 and more significantly in our fourth quarter.
866374_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	In connection with these significant increasing volumes we have experienced manufacturing inefficiencies due to greater start-up costs and resource requirements.
866374_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	As a result, our margins and our results of operations were negatively affected.
866374_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	We procure a wide assortment of materials, including electronic components, plastics and metals.
866374_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	We experienced shortages of numerous commodity components, such as capacitors, connectors, semiconductor and power components, during the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	These shortages began to abate during our second fiscal quarter, and supplies had normalized by the end of the third quarter.
866374_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	We do not expect that our revenues or operations will be materially affected by the recent Japan earthquake and tsunami as operations in Japan constitutes a relatively small component of our consolidated revenue and our facilities in Japan remain intact and undamaged.
866374_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	analyzing the broader effects on our industry as a large number of suppliers to the global market for semiconductors and other electronic components are located in Japan and the disaster therefore may result in disruptions to our supply chain.
866374_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	We are very pleased with the improvements in revenue and profitability during fiscal 2011 as well as our competitive position in the industry.
866374_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	We continue to believe that the long-term, future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities, design and engineering services and after-market services are and will remain strong.
866374_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
866374_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
866374_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
866374_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	We review property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
866374_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of these long-lived assets exceeds their fair value.
866374_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Recoverability of property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets are measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
866374_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets exceeds fair value.
866374_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis.
866374_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	We also evaluate goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows.
866374_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors, market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis.
866374_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	We have one reporting unit: Electronic Manufacturing Services.
866374_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	If the recorded value of the assets, including goodwill, and liabilities ("net book value") of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss may be required to be recognized.
866374_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	Further, to the extent the net book value of the Company as a whole is greater than its market capitalization, all, or a significant portion of its goodwill may be considered impaired.
866374_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, we did not recognize any impairments of our goodwill in connection with our impairment evaluations.
866374_11_ITEM7_P21_S4	The fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value.
866374_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	In fiscal year 2009, we reviewed the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment due to the deterioration in the global macroeconomic environment.
866374_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	During the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008, we concluded that an interim goodwill impairment analysis was required based on the significant decline in the Company's market capitalization during the quarter.
866374_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	As a result of this analysis, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $5.9 billion to write-off the entire carrying value of the Company's goodwill as of the date of the assessment.
866374_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	We have an established customer credit policy through which we manage customer credit exposures through credit evaluations, credit limit setting, monitoring, and enforcement of credit limits for new and existing customers.
866374_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and make provisions for doubtful accounts based on the outcome of those credit evaluations.
866374_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances, current economic trends, historical experience with collections and the age of past due receivables.
866374_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	To the extent we identify exposures as a result of credit or customer evaluations, we also review other customer related exposures, including but not limited to inventory and related contractual obligations.
866374_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	During fiscal year 2009, we incurred $262.7 million of charges for Nortel and other customers that filed for bankruptcy or restructuring protection or otherwise experienced significant financial and liquidity difficulties.
866374_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	These charges related to the write-down of inventory and associated contractual obligations, and provisions for doubtful accounts.
866374_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	In developing the provision for the receivables, we considered various mitigating factors including existing provisions, off-setting obligations and amounts subject to administrative priority claims.
866374_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	In November 2009, we agreed to a settlement with Nortel primarily related to pre-bankruptcy petition claims.
866374_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	As a result, we revised our estimates related to the recovery of Nortel accounts receivable, certain retirement and contractual obligations and other claims.
866374_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	In addition, we have continued to recover amounts related to previously reserved inventory as a result of continuing business with Nortel post bankruptcy.
866374_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	During fiscal year 2010, we recorded a net $2.3 million reduction to the original charge.
866374_11_ITEM7_P25_S5	During fiscal year 2011, we reached settlements relating to the majority of the claims, the impact of which was not material to our financial statements.
866374_11_ITEM7_P25_S6	We do not expect to incur additional charges relating to Nortel or other customers referenced above.
866374_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	We recognize restructuring charges related to our plans to close or consolidate duplicate manufacturing and administrative facilities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	In connection with these activities, we recognize restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other restructuring-related costs.
866374_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	The recognition of these restructuring charges require that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	To the extent our actual results in exiting these facilities differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Refer to Note 9, "Restructuring Charges," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	We have certain investments in, and notes receivable from, non-publicly traded companies, which are included within other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
866374_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Non-majority-owned investments are accounted for using the equity method when we have an ownership percentage equal to or greater than 20%, or have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer; otherwise the cost method is used.
866374_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	We monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies.
866374_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	During fiscal year 2011, we recognized a gain of approximately $18.6 million associated with the sale of an equity investment that was previously fully impaired.
866374_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	As of March 31, 2011, our equity investments in non-majority owned companies totaled $34.0 million.
866374_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	During fiscal year 2010, we sold our entire interest in one of our non-majority owned investments and related note receivable for cash of approximately $252.5 million, net of closing costs.
866374_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	In conjunction with this transaction we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $107.4 million during the first quarter fiscal 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	During the second quarter fiscal 2010, we recognized charges of $92.0 million for other-than-temporary impairment of notes receivable from one affiliate and an equity investment in another affiliate.
866374_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	During fiscal year 2009, we recorded charges of $37.5 million for other-than-temporary impairment of our investments in certain non-publicly traded companies, and also recognized a $74.1 million charge for the other-than-temporary impairment of notes receivable.
866374_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	We recognize manufacturing revenue when we ship goods or the goods are received by our customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured.
866374_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services.
866374_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	If such requirements or obligations exist, then we recognize the related revenues at the time when such requirements are completed and the obligations are fulfilled.
866374_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	We make provisions for estimated sales returns and other adjustments at the time revenue is recognized based upon contractual terms and an analysis of historical returns.
866374_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	These provisions were not material to our consolidated financial statements for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 fiscal years.
866374_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	We provide a comprehensive suite of services for our customers that range from contract design services to original product design to repair services.
866374_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	We recognize service revenue when the services have been performed, and the related costs are expensed as incurred.
866374_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	Our net sales for services were less than 10% of our total sales during the 2011, 2010 and 2009 fiscal years, and accordingly, are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	We have actively pursued business and asset acquisitions, which are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
866374_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	The fair value of the net assets acquired and the results of the acquired businesses are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition dates forward.
866374_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and results of operations during the reporting period.
866374_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, the fair value of acquired net operating assets, property and equipment, intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities, useful lives of plant and equipment and amortizable lives for acquired intangible assets.
866374_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Any excess of the purchase consideration over the identified fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is recognized as goodwill.
866374_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	We estimate the preliminary fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition based on information available at that time.
866374_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the date of the acquisition with subsequent adjustments recorded in earnings.
866374_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	Changes to valuation allowances on acquired deferred taxes are recognized in the provision for, or benefit from, income taxes.
866374_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	The valuation of these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities are subject to further management review and could change materially between the preliminary allocation and end of the purchase price allocation period.
866374_11_ITEM7_P39_S4	Any changes in these estimates may have a material impact on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.
866374_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award using the Black-Scholes option valuation method, and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award.
866374_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	Calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, the expected option life, the risk-free interest rate, and the dividend yield, which are used to calculate fair value.
866374_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	Compensation expense is recognized only for those options expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on the Company's historical experience and future expectations.
866374_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	To the extent actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to compensation cost may be required in future periods.
866374_11_ITEM7_P40_S4	The fair market value of share bonus awards granted is the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant and is generally recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.
866374_11_ITEM7_P40_S5	For share bonus awards where vesting is contingent upon both a service and a performance condition, compensation expense is recognized on a graded attribute basis over the respective requisite service period of the award when achievement of the performance condition is considered probable.
866374_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities which will result in deductible amounts in future years, including net operating loss carryforwards.
866374_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Based on estimates, the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize these deferred income tax assets.
866374_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors.
866374_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets previously recognized, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.
866374_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions in the United States and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	Refer to Note 8 "Income Taxes" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our tax position.
866374_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value.
866374_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short-term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand.
866374_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	We estimate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand, and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers.
866374_11_ITEM7_P43_S3	If actual market conditions or our customers' product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional provisions may be required.
866374_11_ITEM7_P43_S4	In addition, unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers and/or changes in economic conditions may require additional write downs for inventories due to our customers' inability to fulfill their contractual obligations with regard to inventory procured to fulfill customer demand.
866374_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales.
866374_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	The data below, and discussion that follows, represents our results from operations.
866374_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2011 totaled $28.7 billion, representing an increase of $4.6 billion, or 19%, from $24.1 billion during fiscal year 2010, primarily due to an improved macroeconomic environment that led to increased demand for our OEM customers ends products.
866374_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	Sales during fiscal year 2011 increased across all of the markets we serve, consisting of: (i) $1.4 billion in the industrial, automotive, medical and other markets, (ii) $1.1 billion in the mobile communications market, (iii) $0.8 billion in the consumer digital market, (iv) $0.8 billion in the infrastructure market and (v) $0.5 billion in the computing market.
866374_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	These increases were driven by increased sales from almost all of our major customers combined with new customer wins and new program wins with existing customers.
866374_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	Net sales increased across all of the geographical regions we serve, consisting of $3.2 billion in Asia, $0.9 billion in Europe and $0.5 billion in the Americas.
866374_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2010 totaled $24.1 billion, representing a decrease of $6.8 billion, or 22%, from $30.9 billion during fiscal 2009, primarily due to reduced customer demand as a result of the weakened macroeconomic environment, market share losses and re-alignment of the outsourcing strategy of a key customer in the mobile communications market, and financial distress and reorganization of another key customer in the infrastructure market.
866374_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	The decline in revenues resulting from these two customers was approximately $3.7 billion or 11.8% of fiscal 2009 revenue.
866374_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	These declines in sales were partially offset by a significant revenue increase from a newly emerging key customer in the smart phone market as well as expanded sales with a key customer in the computing market.
866374_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	Sales during fiscal year 2010 decreased across all of the markets we serve, consisting of: (i) $3.2 billion in the infrastructure market, (ii) $1.2 billion in the mobile communications market, (iii) $1.2 billion in the consumer digital market, and (iv) $1.2 billion in the computing, and the industrial, automotive, and other markets.
866374_11_ITEM7_P46_S4	Net sales decreased across all of the geographical regions we serve, consisting of $3.6 billion in Asia, $2.5 billion in the Americas, and $0.8 billion in Europe.
866374_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The following table sets forth net sales by market:
866374_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our ten largest customers during fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009 accounted for approximately 52%, 47% and 50% of net sales, respectively, with Research In Motion accounting for greater than 10% of our net sales during fiscal 2011, Hewlett-Packard accounting for greater than 10% of our net sales during fiscal 2010 and Sony-Ericsson accounting for greater than 10% of our net sales during fiscal 2009.
866374_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Gross profit is affected by a number of factors, including the number and size of new manufacturing programs, product mix, component costs and availability, product life cycles, unit volumes, pricing, competition, new product introductions, capacity utilization and the expansion and consolidation of manufacturing facilities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The flexible design of our manufacturing processes allows us to build a broad range of products in our facilities, which allows us to better utilize our manufacturing capacity.
866374_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	In the cases of new programs, profitability normally lags revenue growth due to product start-up costs, lower manufacturing program volumes in the start-up phase, operational inefficiencies, and under-absorbed overhead.
866374_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Gross margin often improves over time as manufacturing program volumes increase, as our utilization rates and overhead absorption improves, and as we increase the level of vertically-integrated manufacturing services content.
866374_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	As a result of these various factors, our gross margin varies from period to period.
866374_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Gross profit during fiscal year 2011 increased $367.4 million to $1.6 billion from $1.2 billion during fiscal year 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	Gross margin increased to 5.5% of net sales in fiscal year 2011 as compared with 5.0% of net sales in fiscal 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	The 50 basis point year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to increased net sales resulting in better utilization of our capacity and absorption of our fixed costs, and in part, due to cost reduction and operational efficiency benefits related to prior years' restructuring activities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	We did not incur restructuring charges during fiscal year 2011 compared to restructuring costs of $92.5 million in fiscal 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Gross profit during fiscal year 2010 decreased $62.9 million to $1.2 billion from $1.3 billion during fiscal year 2009.
866374_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	Gross margin increased to 5.0% of net sales in fiscal 2010 as compared with 4.1% of net sales in fiscal 2009.
866374_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	The 90 basis point year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to an approximate 40 basis point improvement due to the Nortel bankruptcy in the prior year, an approximate 10 basis point reduction in restructuring charges recognized during fiscal year 2010, and an increase primarily attributable to improved capacity utilization as a result of cost reduction benefits derived from our restructuring activities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	During fiscal year 2009, we incurred $145.3 million in charges related to the Nortel bankruptcy, of which $98.0 million were recorded in cost of sales.
866374_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	In November 2009, we agreed to a settlement with Nortel primarily related to pre-bankruptcy petition claims.
866374_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	As a result, we revised our estimates related to the recovery of Nortel accounts receivable, certain retirement and contractual obligations and other claims.
866374_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	During fiscal year 2010, we recorded a net $2.3 million reduction to the original charge, which included reductions to cost of sales of $18.3 million and $26.3 million coupled with corresponding increases to selling, general and administrative expenses of $18.3 million and $24.0 million in the first and third quarters of fiscal 2010, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	The total impact of the original $98.0 million charge in fiscal 2009 to cost of sales coupled with the $44.6 million recovery in cost of sales during fiscal 2010 resulted in an approximate 40 basis point year over year increase in gross margin.
866374_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	We did not incur restructuring charges during fiscal year 2011 and have completed essentially all activities associated with previously announced plans.
866374_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	We recognized restructuring charges of approximately $107.5 million during fiscal year 2010 as part of our restructuring plans previously announced in March 2009 in order to rationalize our global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in response to weakened macroeconomic conditions.
866374_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	The costs associated with these restructuring activities included employee severance, costs related to owned and leased facilities and equipment that is no longer in use and is to be disposed of, and other costs associated with the exit of certain contractual arrangements due to facility closures.
866374_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	We classified approximately $92.4 million of these charges as cost of sales and approximately $15.1 million of these charges as selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal year 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P56_S3	The charges recognized by reportable geographic region amounted to $45.1 million, $25.1 million and $37.3 million for Asia, the Americas and Europe, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM7_P56_S4	Approximately $43.1 million of these restructuring charges were non-cash.
866374_11_ITEM7_P56_S5	As of March 31, 2011, accrued severance and facility closure costs related to restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2010 were approximately $2.1 million, the entire amount of which was classified as current.
866374_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	During fiscal year 2009, we recognized restructuring charges of approximately $179.8 million related primarily to rationalizing our global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure as a result of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions.
866374_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	The global economic crisis and the related decline in demand for our customers' products across all of the industries we serve, caused our OEM customers to reduce their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing and negatively impacted our capacity utilization levels.
866374_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	Our restructuring activities improved our operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce and capacity.
866374_11_ITEM7_P57_S3	In addition to the cost reductions, these activities further shifted our manufacturing capacity to locations with higher efficiencies and, in most instances, lower costs.
866374_11_ITEM7_P57_S4	The costs associated with these restructuring activities included employee severance, costs related to owned and leased facilities and equipment that is no longer in use and is to be disposed of, and other costs associated with the exit of certain contractual arrangements due to facility closures.
866374_11_ITEM7_P57_S5	We classified approximately $155.1 million of these charges as cost of sales and approximately $24.7 million of these charges as selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal year 2009.
866374_11_ITEM7_P57_S6	The charges recognized by reportable geographic region amounted to $96.9 million, $56.7 million and $26.2 million for Asia, the Americas and Europe, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM7_P57_S7	Approximately $55.8 million of these restructuring charges were non-cash.
866374_11_ITEM7_P57_S8	As of March 31, 2011, accrued severance and facility closure costs related to restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2009 was approximately $6.8 million, of which approximately $1.1 million was classified as a long-term obligation.
866374_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our restructuring activities improve our operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce and capacity.
866374_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The cost reductions associated with the restructuring activities, primarily reduced wages and benefits due to employee terminations, decreased depreciation expense resulting from equipment impairments and reduced costs associated with leased equipment and buildings have been achieved as anticipated.
866374_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	programs or increased production ramp up costs.
866374_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	We do not separately track all of the interrelated components of these activities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Refer to Note 9, "Restructuring Charges," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG A, totaled $816.3 million or 2.8% of net sales, during fiscal year 2011, compared to $767.1 million, or 3.2% of net sales, during fiscal year 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of increased compensation expense due to increased headcount in various corporate support activities, such as information technology and supply chain management, necessary to support the growth of our operations.
866374_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	Further, we realized increased costs associated with research, development and engineering activities as we continue to make investments to meet the needs of our customers.
866374_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	The overall decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales during fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to our significant increase in sales as we were able to leverage our SG A percentage down.
866374_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG A, totaled $767.1 million or 3.2% of net sales, during fiscal year 2010, compared to $979.1 million, or 3.2% of net sales, during fiscal year 2009.
866374_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	A expense and SG A as a percentage of sales during the fiscal year 2010 were primarily the result of our restructuring activities and discretionary cost reduction actions, and the recognition of provisions for accounts receivable from financially distressed customers of $73.3 million incurred during fiscal 2009.
866374_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	These decreases were partially offset by the additional charges in fiscal 2010 related to Nortel, discussed in gross profit above.
866374_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	During our third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2009, which ended December 31, 2008, we concluded that an interim goodwill impairment assessment was required due to the significant decline in our market capitalization, which was driven largely by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions that contributed to a considerable decrease in market multiples as well as a decline in our estimated discounted cash flows.
866374_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	As a result of our analysis, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to goodwill in the amount of $5.9 billion during the quarter ended December 31, 2008 to eliminate the entire carrying value of our goodwill as of the date of the assessment.
866374_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal year 2011 decreased by $18.7 million to $70.9 million from $89.6 million in fiscal year 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	The reduction in expense was primarily due to certain assets becoming fully amortized and the use of the accelerated method of amortization for certain customer related intangibles, which results in decreasing expense over time, and was partially offset by purchase accounting adjustments.
866374_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal year 2010 decreased by $46.3 million to $89.6 million from $135.9 million in fiscal year 2009.
866374_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	The reduction in expense was primarily due to the use of the accelerated method of amortization for certain customer related intangibles, which results in decreasing expense over time.
866374_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	During fiscal year 2011, we recognized charges totaling $6.3 million, consisting of a $13.2 million loss associated with the early redemption of our 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes, and an $11.7 million loss in connection with the divestiture of certain international entities, offset by a gain of $18.6 million associated with the sale of an equity investment that was previously fully impaired.
866374_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	During fiscal year 2010, we sold our entire interest in one of our non-majority owned investments and related note receivable for cash of approximately $252.5 million, and recognized an impairment charge associated with the sale of $107.4 million.
866374_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	We also recognized charges totaling approximately $92.0 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 associated with the other-than-temporary impairment of our notes receivable from one affiliate and an equity investment in another affiliate.
866374_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	Deterioration in the business prospects, cash flow expectations, and increased liability concerns of the affiliate and the equity investment resulted in the impairment of the carrying value to the estimated recoverable value.
866374_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	During fiscal year 2009, we recognized approximately $74.1 million in charges to write-down certain notes receivable from an affiliate to the expected recoverable amount, and approximately $37.5 million in charges for the other-than-temporary impairment of certain of our investments in companies that were experiencing significant financial and liquidity difficulties.
866374_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	These charges were offset to some extent by a gain of $22.3 million resulting from the partial extinguishment of $260.0 million in principal amount of our 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 1, 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	Interest and other expense, net was $75.8 million during fiscal year 2011, compared to $155.6 million during fiscal year 2010, a decrease of $79.8 million.
866374_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	The decrease in expense was the result of reduced debt levels as we redeemed $542.1 million of certain subordinated notes during the fiscal year.
866374_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	Further reduction in interest expense was due to lower interest rates as a result of $847.0 million in fixed rate debt.
866374_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	This decrease in interest expense was partially offset by interest expense on $160.0 million borrowed under our revolving lines of credit and $379.0 million borrowed under our Asia term loans.
866374_11_ITEM7_P69_S4	In addition, we recognized approximately $9.2 million of income during fiscal 2011 from foreign exchange gains.
866374_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Interest and other expense, net was $155.6 million during fiscal year 2010, compared to $231.9 million (as restated for the retrospective application of a new accounting standard) during fiscal year 2009, a decrease of $76.3 million.
866374_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	The decrease in expense was primarily the result of less debt outstanding during the fiscal period including the approximate $400.0 million tender and redemption of the 6.5% Senior Subordinated Notes and the $100.0 million tender of the 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes.
866374_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	Further reduction in interest expense was due to lower interest rates on variable rate debt and a decrease in non-cash interest expense due to our repurchase of $260.0 million of principal value of our 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes during December 2008 and redemption of our Zero Coupon Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes in July 2009, partially offset by less interest income resulting from the reduction in other notes receivable that were sold during the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates.
866374_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	The consolidated effective tax rate for a particular period varies depending on the amount of earnings from different jurisdictions, operating loss carryforwards, income tax credits, changes in previously established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based upon our current analysis of the realizability of these deferred tax assets, as well as certain tax holidays and incentives granted to our subsidiaries primarily in China, Malaysia, Israel, Poland and Singapore.
866374_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	deferred tax assets, we consider our recent history of operating income and losses by jurisdiction, exclusive of items that we believe are non-recurring in nature such as restructuring charges.
866374_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	We also consider the future projected operating income in the relevant jurisdiction and the effect of any tax planning strategies.
866374_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	Based on this analysis, we believe that the current valuation allowance is adequate.
866374_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	We have tax loss carryforwards attributable to operations for which we have recognized deferred tax assets.
866374_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	Our policy is to provide a reserve against those deferred tax assets that in our estimate are not more likely than not to be realized.
866374_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	During the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2009, the provision for income taxes includes a benefit of approximately $50.2 million for the reversal of valuation allowances.
866374_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	We received no tax benefit from the impairment of goodwill or distressed customer charges.
866374_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions in the United States and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	See Note 8, "Income Taxes," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion.
866374_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	As of March 31, 2011, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 billion and bank and other borrowings of $2.2 billion.
866374_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	The Company also had a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, under which we had $160.0 million in borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Cash provided by operating activities was $857.3 million during fiscal year 2011, which resulted primarily from $596.2 million of net income for the period and $475.7 million of non-cash earnings adjustment items such as depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges, non-cash interest income, and stock compensation expense.
866374_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	Offsetting these cash generating activities was $221.5 million of increased working capital.
866374_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	Our working capital accounts increased primarily due to an increase of $664.7 million in inventories as a result of our increased production and anticipated growth, and an increase of $390.4 million in other current assets primarily attributable to $324.6 million in our deferred purchase price receivable associated with our receivables sales, which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $609.9 million and other current liabilities of $155.2 million, primarily driven by the timing of purchases and cash payments.
866374_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2011 was $413.2 million.
866374_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	This resulted primarily from $393.9 million in capital expenditures for equipment, net of proceeds on sales, and $17.0 million, net of cash acquired, for contingent consideration and deferred purchase price payments related to four acquisitions, and payments related to two completed acquisitions.
866374_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	Cash used was partially offset by proceeds related to the sale of an equity investment for $18.6 million.
866374_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $641.7 million during fiscal year 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	On each of May 26, 2010, August 12, 2010 and March 23, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million, for a combined total of $600.0 million, of our outstanding shares.
866374_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	During the 2011 fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 65.4 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of $400.4 million, including accrued expenses.
866374_11_ITEM7_P80_S3	In August 2010, we paid $240.0 million to redeem the entire principal amount of the 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes at par plus accrued interest.
866374_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	premium of our 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes ("6.25% Notes") plus accrued interest.
866374_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	In addition, we made repayments of approximately $217.1 million related to our Global Asset-Backed Securitization program effective with the adoption of new accounting standards on April 1, 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	The cash used in financing activities was partially offset by $379.0 million of additional borrowings under new Asia term loan agreements and $160.0 million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit.
866374_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	During September 2010, we entered into two new three-year term loan agreements with certain financial institutions based in Asia and borrowed $180.0 million in the aggregate.
866374_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	During February 2011, we entered into a new three-year term loan agreement with a financial institution based in Asia and borrowed $200.0 million in the aggregate.
866374_11_ITEM7_P82_S3	Borrowings under the term loans bear interest at LIBOR plus margins ranging between 2.15% and 2.30% and we paid non-refundable fees totaling $2.4 million at the inception of certain of the loans.
866374_11_ITEM7_P82_S4	We have no significant borrowings outstanding that are due within the next twelve months.
866374_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	Cash provided by operating activities was $798.9 million during fiscal year 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	This resulted primarily from $18.6 million of net income for the period before adjustments to include approximately $736.4 million of non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, non-cash interest income, and stock compensation expense.
866374_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	Our working capital accounts increased $169.5 million on a net basis, primarily as a result of increased business volume as both accounts receivable and accounts payable increased.
866374_11_ITEM7_P83_S3	The reduction in other current and non current liabilities was primarily due to lower continued payout of prior obligations and accrued obligations related to acquisitions, restructuring charges and financing charges.
866374_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2010 was $7.8 million.
866374_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	This resulted primarily from proceeds related to the sale of an equity investment and note receivable for $259.8 million, net of closing costs, and was partially offset by approximately $176.5 million in capital expenditures for equipment, net of proceeds on sales and $75.9 million of deferred purchase price payments related to certain historical acquisitions and for three acquisitions completed during the fiscal year 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $713.3 million during fiscal year 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	During June 2009, we used $203.2 million to repurchase an aggregate principal amount of $99.8 million of our 6.5% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 ("6.5% Notes") and an aggregate principal amount of $99.9 million of the 6.25% Notes due 2014 in a cash tender offer.
866374_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	On July 31, 2009, we paid $195.0 million to redeem the 0% Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes upon their maturity.
866374_11_ITEM7_P85_S3	On March 19, 2010, we used $306.3 million to redeem all of the remaining principle balance of $299.8 million of the 6.5% Notes.
866374_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion during fiscal year 2009.
866374_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	This resulted primarily from a $6.1 billion net loss for the period before adjustments to include approximately $6.7 billion of non-cash items, primarily consisting of a $5.9 billion goodwill impairment charge, as well as other non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, restructuring and distressed customer charges, investment and notes receivable impairment charges, stock-based compensation expense, accretion of interest on notes receivable, and the gain recognized on the partial extinguishment of our 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	Our working capital accounts decreased $800.1 million on a net basis as a result of overall lower business volume, which also contributed to cash provided by operating activities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P86_S3	Net working capital, defined as current assets minus current liabilities, overall decreased to approximately $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2009 from $2.9 billion as of March 31, 2008.
866374_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	and the $800.1 million contribution to cash provided from operations was primarily from $212.3 million in purchase accounting adjustments and acquired working capital balances attributable to acquisitions, and the reclassification of $195.0 million principal amount of our Zero Coupon Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes due July 31, 2009 to a current obligation.
866374_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	Cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2009 was $644.9 million.
866374_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	This resulted primarily from $462.1 million in net capital expenditures for equipment, $200.0 million for the acquisitions of businesses, and $14.8 million for contingent purchase price payments related to historical acquisitions.

866374_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	We continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase ordinary shares.
866374_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Our free cash flow, which is calculated as cash provided by operations less net purchases of property, plant and equipment, was $463.5 million, $622.5 million and $854.7 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Free cash flow provided liquidity to redeem debt and repurchase ordinary shares.
866374_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	For the fiscal periods indicated, certain key liquidity metrics were as follows:
866374_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	Days in trade accounts receivable was calculated as the average accounts receivable, reduced by the net cash benefit recognized by the company from our asset-backed securitization programs, for the current and prior fiscal years divided by annualized sales for the fiscal year by day.
866374_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, days in trade accounts receivable decreased by two days to 36 days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 as we were able to increase our sales by a greater percentage than our accounts receivable as a result of lower purchases during our fourth quarter.
866374_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	Deferred purchase price receivables included in trade receivables were $460.0 million, $135.4 million and $123.8 million for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM7_P94_S3	Deferred purchase price receivables were recorded in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
866374_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Days in inventory was calculated as the average inventory for the current and prior fiscal years divided by cost of sales for the fiscal year by day.
866374_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, days in inventory decreased four days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010.
866374_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	The decrease in days in inventory is primarily attributable to the timing of purchases and cash payments.
866374_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	Days in accounts payable was calculated as the average accounts payable for the current and prior fiscal years divided by annualized cost of sales for the fiscal year by day.
866374_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, days in accounts payable decreased four days to 64 days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 primarily due to decreased purchases of inventory in our fourth quarter.
866374_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Cash conversion cycle was calculated as days in trade receivables plus days in inventory, minus days in accounts payable.
866374_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	Cash conversion cycle is a measure of how efficient we are at managing our working capital.
866374_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	days to 15 days as compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 and decreased seven days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009.
866374_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets.
866374_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world.
866374_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances.
866374_11_ITEM7_P101_S2	We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout the global organization.
866374_11_ITEM7_P101_S3	We believe that our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months.
866374_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, the timing of capital expenditures for new equipment, the extent to which we utilize operating leases for new facilities and equipment, and the levels of shipments and changes in the volumes of customer orders.
866374_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	Liquidity needs are also dependent upon the extent of cash charges associated with restructuring and integration activities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	Historically, we have funded operations from cash and cash equivalents generated from operations, proceeds from public offerings of equity and debt securities, bank debt and lease financings.
866374_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	We also continuously sell a designated pool of trade receivables under asset-backed securitization programs and sell certain trade receivables, which are in addition to the trade receivables sold in connection with these securitization agreements, to certain third-party banking institutions with limited recourse.
866374_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	In connection with new accounting standards that we adopted during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the accounts receivable factoring and the Global and North America Asset-Backed Securitization programs were amended such that the accounts receivables sold under these programs continue to be removed from our balance sheets.
866374_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	A portion of the purchase price is paid in cash and the balance is a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid as payments on the receivables are collected from account debtors.
866374_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	The deferred purchase price receivable represents a beneficial interest in the transferred financial assets, and is recognized at fair value as part of the sale transaction.
866374_11_ITEM7_P104_S2	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, we had sold receivables for cash totaling $654.7 million and $581.3 million, respectively, net of our participation through asset-backed security and other financing arrangements, which are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
866374_11_ITEM7_P104_S3	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred purchase price receivable was approximately $460.0 million and $135.4 million, respectively and was recorded in Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
866374_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	We anticipate that we will enter into debt and equity financings, sales of accounts receivable and lease transactions to fund acquisitions and anticipated growth.
866374_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	The sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current shareholders.
866374_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	Further, we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations and could increase debt service obligations.
866374_11_ITEM7_P106_S2	This increased indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, potentially affect our credit ratings, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_11_ITEM7_P106_S3	Any downgrades in credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow as a result of more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_11_ITEM7_P106_S4	We continue to asses our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase ordinary shares.
866374_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	We have a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility that expires in May 2012.
866374_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	As of March 31, 2011, there was $160.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.
866374_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	The credit facility requires that we maintain a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined.
866374_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	As of March 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the covenants under the credit facility.
866374_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	We and certain of our subsidiaries also have various uncommitted revolving credit facilities, lines of credit and other loans in the amount of $321.6 million in the aggregate under which there were approximately $1.6 million of borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	We have approximately $1.7 billion of borrowings outstanding under a term loan facility as of March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	Of this amount, approximately $500.0 million matures in October 2012, and the remainder matures in October 2014.
866374_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	Loans under the facility amortize in quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1% per annum.
866374_11_ITEM7_P110_S3	The facility requires that we maintain a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, and as of March 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the covenants under the facility.
866374_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	We have approximately $379.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Asia term loan agreements as of March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	The term loan agreements mature in September 2013 and February 2014.
866374_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	Borrowings under the term loans bear interest at LIBOR plus margins ranging between 2.15% and 2.30% and we paid non-refundable fees of $2.4 million at the inception of the loans.
866374_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	Refer to the discussion in Note 4, "Bank Borrowings and Long-Term Debt" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the Company's debt obligations.
866374_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	We have purchase obligations that arise in the normal course of business, primarily consisting of binding purchase orders for inventory related items and capital expenditures.
866374_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	Additionally, we have leased certain of our equipment under capital lease commitments, and certain of our facilities and equipment under operating lease commitments.
866374_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	Future payments due under our purchase obligations, debt and related interest obligations and operating lease contracts are as follows:
866374_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	Borrowings under our term loan facility bear interest, at the Company's option, either at (i) the base rate (the greater of the agent's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus a margin of 1.25%; or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%.
866374_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	Interest expense in the table above is estimated based on LIBOR as of March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	We have excluded $134.6 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from the contractual obligations table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the periodic cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities.
866374_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	See Note 8, "Income Taxes" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
866374_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements.
866374_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	We intend to use our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations to fund our existing and future contractual obligations.
866374_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	At March 31, 2010, under our Global Asset-Backed Securitization program, we sold a designated pool of receivables to a third-party qualified special purpose entity, which in turn sold an undivided interest to an investment conduit administered by an unaffiliated financial institution.
866374_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	We participated in this securitization arrangement as an investor in the conduit.
866374_11_ITEM7_P118_S2	The fair value of our investment participation, together with our recourse obligation that approximated 5% of the total receivables sold, was approximately $135.4 million.
866374_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	Effective September 29, 2010, the Global Asset-Backed Securitization agreement was amended to provide for the sale by the special purpose entity of 100% of the pool of receivables to an unaffiliated financial institution.
866374_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	Following their sale, these receivables are removed from our balance sheet.
866374_11_ITEM7_P119_S2	We continuously sell a designated pool of trade receivables under this program to the special purpose entity, which in turn sells the receivables to an unaffiliated financial institution under this program, and in addition to cash, we receive a deferred purchase price receivable for the receivables sold which are not paid for in cash.
866374_11_ITEM7_P119_S3	The deferred purchase price receivable we retain serves as additional credit support to the financial institution and is recorded at its estimated fair value.
866374_11_ITEM7_P119_S4	The fair value of our deferred purchase price receivable was approximately $361.9 million as of March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	As a result of new accounting guidance effective April 1, 2010 and an amendment to our North American Asset-Backed Securitization program, 100% of the accounts receivable sold under this program are removed from our balance sheet.
866374_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	We continuously sell a designated pool of trade receivables under this program to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells these receivables to investment conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution under this program, and in addition to cash, we receive a deferred purchase price receivable for the receivables sold which are not paid for in cash.
866374_11_ITEM7_P120_S2	The deferred purchase price receivable we retain serves as additional credit support to the investment conduits and is recorded at its estimated fair value.
866374_11_ITEM7_P120_S3	The fair value of our deferred purchase price receivable was approximately $98.1 million as of March 31, 2011.

866374_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio, which consists of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from original dates of purchase.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to 20% of the issuer's or fund's total assets measured at the time of purchase or $10.0 million, whichever is greater.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We protect our invested principal by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	investment issuer, guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Maturities of short-term investments are timed, whenever possible, to correspond with debt payments and capital investments.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As of March 31, 2011, the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was $0.4 billion, comprised mainly of money market funds with an average return of 1.53%.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We had variable rate debt outstanding of approximately $2.2 billion as of March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Variable rate debt obligations primarily consisted of borrowings under the $1.7 billion term loan facility.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Interest on the term loan facility is based at our option on either (i) the base rate (the greater of the agent's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus a margin of 1.25%; or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P5_S2	We also have a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility under which we had $160.0 million of borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P5_S3	Interest on this facility is based at our option on either (i) the base rate (the greater of the agent's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%); or (ii) LIBOR plus the applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranging between 0.50% and 1.25%, based on our credit ratings.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	During our 2011 fiscal year we entered into three Asia term loan agreements totaling $380.0 million in variable rate debt, of which the amount outstanding at March 31, 2011 was $379.0 million.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P6_S1	and we paid non-refundable fees of $2.4 million at the inception of certain of the loans.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Variable rate debt also included demand notes and certain variable lines of credit.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P6_S3	These credit lines are located throughout the world and variable interest is generally based on a spread over that country's inter-bank offering rate.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Our variable rate debt instruments create exposures for us related to interest rate risk.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Primarily due to the current low interest rates a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	As of March 31, 2011, the approximate fair value of our debt outstanding under our $1.7 billion term loan facility was 99.3%, of the face value of the debt obligation, based on broker trading prices.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Our Asia term loans are not traded publicly; however, as the pricing, maturity and other pertinent terms of these loans closely approximate those of the $1.7 billion term loan facility, management estimates the respective fair values would be approximately the same.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	We have established a foreign currency risk management policy to manage this risk.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P10_S2	To the extent possible, we manage our foreign currency exposure by evaluating and using non-financial techniques, such as currency of invoice, leading and lagging payments and receivables management.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P10_S3	In addition, we borrow in various foreign currencies and enter into short-term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities, mainly accounts receivable and accounts payable, and cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P11_S0	We endeavor to maintain a fully hedged position for certain transaction exposures.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P11_S1	These exposures are primarily, but not limited to, revenues, customer and vendor payments and inter-company balances in currencies other than the functional currency unit of the operating entity.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P11_S2	The credit risk of our foreign currency forward and swap contracts is minimized since all contracts are with large financial institutions and accordingly, fair value adjustments related to the credit risk of the counter-party financial institution was not material.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P12_S0	generally offset the losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and transactions hedged.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The fair value of currency forward and swap contracts is reported on the balance sheet.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P12_S2	The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts as of March 31, 2011 amounted to $2.4 billion and the recorded fair values of the associated asset and/or liability were not material.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The majority of these foreign exchange contracts expire in less than three months and all expire within one year.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P13_S1	They will settle in Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, China renminbi, Czech koruna, Danish krone, Euro, Hungarian forint, Indian rupee, Israeli shekel, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Norwegian krone, Polish zloty, Romanian lei, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc, Taiwan dollar and U.S. dollar.
866374_11_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Based on our overall currency rate exposures as of March 31, 2011, including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and cash flows, a near-term 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar from its cross-functional rates would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.

866374_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Flextronics International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2011.

866374_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	For consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries in which the Company owns less than 100%, the Company recognizes a noncontrolling interest for the ownership of the noncontrolling owners.
866374_11_ITEM8_P17_S3	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, noncontrolling interest was not material.
866374_11_ITEM8_P17_S4	The associated noncontrolling owners' interest in the income or losses of these companies has not been material to the Company's results of operations for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, and has been classified within Interest and other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

866374_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	The financial position and results of operations for certain of the Company's subsidiaries are measured using a currency other than the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.

866374_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	The amount subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments is generally limited to the amount, if any, by which a counterparty's obligations exceed the obligations of the Company with that counterparty.
866374_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	To manage counterparty risk, the Company limits its derivative transactions to those with recognized financial institutions.
866374_11_ITEM8_P32_S2	See additional discussion of derivatives at Note 5.
866374_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from original dates of purchase are carried at cost, which approximates fair market value, and are considered to be cash equivalents.
866374_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash deposited in checking accounts, money market funds and time deposits.
866374_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following:
866374_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value.
866374_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	The stated cost is comprised of direct materials, labor and overhead.
866374_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	The components of inventories, net of applicable lower of cost or market write-downs, were as follows:

866374_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
866374_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	Recoverability of property and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the projected undiscounted cash flows the property and equipment are expected to generate.
866374_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
866374_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	Refer to Note 9, "Restructuring Charges" for a discussion of impairment charges recorded in fiscal year 2009.
866374_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company provides for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
866374_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities by applying the applicable statutory tax rate to such differences.
866374_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company has actively pursued business and asset acquisitions, which are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
866374_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	The fair value of the net assets acquired and the results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition dates forward.
866374_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and results of operations during the reporting period.
866374_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, the fair value of acquired net operating assets, property and equipment, intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities, useful lives of plant and equipment and amortizable lives for acquired intangible assets.
866374_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	Any excess of the purchase consideration over the identified fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is recognized as goodwill.
866374_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company estimates the preliminary fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition based on information available at that time.
866374_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the date of the acquisition with subsequent adjustments recorded in earnings.
866374_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	Changes to valuation allowances on acquired deferred tax assets are recognized in the provision for, or benefit from, income taxes.
866374_11_ITEM8_P45_S3	The valuation of these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities is subject to further management review and may change materially between the preliminary allocation and end of the purchase price allocation period.
866374_11_ITEM8_P45_S4	Any changes in these estimates may have a material effect on the Company's consolidated operating results or financial position.
866374_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
866374_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors, market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis.
866374_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company has one reporting unit: Electronic Manufacturing Services.
866374_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	If the recorded value of the assets, including goodwill, and liabilities ("net book value") of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss may be required to be recognized.
866374_11_ITEM8_P47_S2	Further, to the extent the net book value of the Company as a whole is greater than its market capitalization, all, or a significant portion of its goodwill may be considered impaired.
866374_11_ITEM8_P47_S3	The Company completed its annual impairment test during its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test.
866374_11_ITEM8_P47_S4	The fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value.
866374_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	During its third fiscal quarter of 2009, which ended December 31, 2008, the Company concluded that an interim goodwill impairment analysis was required.
866374_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	Pursuant to the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets, the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of two steps.
866374_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	In the first step, the fair value of the Company is compared to its carrying value.
866374_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	In connection with the preparation of interim financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2008, management completed a valuation of the Company, which incorporated existing market-based considerations as well as a discounted cash flow methodology based on current results and projections, and concluded the estimated fair value of the Company was less than its net book value.
866374_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	Accordingly the guidance required a second step to determine the implied fair value of the Company's goodwill, and to compare it to the carrying value of the Company's goodwill.
866374_11_ITEM8_P50_S3	This second step included valuing all of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the Company as if it had been acquired in a business combination, including valuing all of the Company's intangible assets even if they were not currently recorded to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.
866374_11_ITEM8_P50_S4	The result of this assessment indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill as of that date was zero.
866374_11_ITEM8_P50_S5	As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $5.9 billion during the quarter ended December 31, 2008 to write-off the entire carrying value of its goodwill.
866374_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	The following table summarizes the activity in the Company's goodwill account during fiscal years 2011 and 2010:
866374_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	(1) For fiscal years 2011 and 2010, additions were attributable to certain acquisitions that were not individually, nor in the aggregate, significant to the Company.
866374_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	(2) Includes adjustments and reclassifications resulting from management's review and finalization of the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired through certain business combinations completed in a period subsequent to the respective acquisition, based on management's estimates.
866374_11_ITEM8_P52_S2	Adjustments and reclassifications during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were attributable to purchase accounting adjustments for certain historical acquisitions that were not individually, nor in the aggregate, significant to the Company.
866374_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company's acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible may not be recoverable.
866374_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
866374_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	The Company reviewed the carrying value of its intangible assets concurrent with its testing of goodwill for impairment for the period ended March 31, 2011 and concluded that such amounts continued to be recoverable.
866374_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	Intangible assets are comprised of customer-related intangibles, which primarily include contractual agreements and customer relationships; and licenses and other intangibles, which is primarily comprised of licenses and also includes patents and trademarks, and developed technologies.
866374_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	Generally customer-related intangibles are amortized on an accelerated method based on expected cash flows, generally over a period of up to eight years, and licenses and other intangibles generally over a period of up to seven years.
866374_11_ITEM8_P55_S2	No residual value is estimated for any intangible assets.
866374_11_ITEM8_P55_S3	During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the Company did not have any material additions to intangible assets.
866374_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	management's estimates of cash flow and recoverability.
866374_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	The components of acquired intangible assets are as follows:
866374_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	Total intangible amortization expense recognized during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $70.9 million, $89.6 million and $135.9 million, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	As of March 31, 2011, the weighted-average remaining useful lives of the Company's intangible assets were approximately 2.0 years and 3.5 years for customer-related intangibles, and licenses and other intangibles, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM8_P58_S2	The estimated future annual amortization expense for acquired intangible assets is as follows:
866374_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	All derivative instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value.
866374_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	If the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, effectiveness is measured quarterly based on a regression of the forward rate on the derivative instrument against the forward rate for the furthest time period the hedged item can be recognized and still be within the documented hedge period.
866374_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized in shareholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings.
866374_11_ITEM8_P59_S3	Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings immediately.
866374_11_ITEM8_P59_S4	If the derivative instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period.
866374_11_ITEM8_P59_S5	Additional information is included in Note 5.
866374_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	Other current assets includes approximately $460.0 million as of March 31, 2011 for the deferred purchase price receivable from our Global and North American Asset-Backed Securitization programs and approximately $135.4 million as of March 31, 2010 for the deferred purchase price receivable and investment participation in the qualified special purpose entity from the Global Asset-Backed Securitization program.
866374_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	See Note 6 for additional information regarding the Company's participation in its trade receivables securitization programs.
866374_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company has certain equity investments in, and notes receivable from, non-publicly traded companies, which are included within other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
866374_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	Non-majority-owned investments are accounted for using the equity method when the Company has an ownership percentage equal to or greater than 20%, or has the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer; otherwise the cost method is used.
866374_11_ITEM8_P61_S2	The Company monitors these investments for impairment indicators and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values as required.
866374_11_ITEM8_P61_S3	Fair values of these investments, when required, are estimated using unobservable inputs, primarily discounted cash flow projections.
866374_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company's equity investments in non-majority owned companies totaled $34.0 million and $27.3 million, respectively, of which $1.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, were accounted for using the equity method.
866374_11_ITEM8_P62_S1	The equity in the earnings or losses of the Company's equity method investments were not material to the consolidated results of operations for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009.
866374_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	During fiscal 2011, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $18.6 million, associated with the sale of an equity investment that was previously fully impaired, which is included in Other charges, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
866374_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	During fiscal 2010, total impairment charges related to the Company's equity investments and notes receivable for fiscal year 2010 were approximately $199.4 million and are included in Other charges, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

866374_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company recognizes restructuring charges related to its plans to close or consolidate excess manufacturing and administrative facilities.
866374_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	In connection with these activities, the Company records restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other exit-related costs.
866374_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	The recognition of restructuring charges requires the Company to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	To the extent the Company's actual results differ from its estimates and assumptions, the Company may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_11_ITEM8_P66_S2	Such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	See Note 9 for additional information regarding restructuring charges.
866374_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company historically granted equity compensation awards to acquire the Company's ordinary shares under four plans, the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2002 Interim Incentive Plan, the Solectron Corporation 2002 Stock Plan and the 2004 Award Plan for New Employees, which we refer to in this note as the Company's Prior Plans.
866374_11_ITEM8_P68_S1	As of March 31, 2011, the Company grants equity compensation awards under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan"), which was approved and adopted by the Company's shareholders at the Company's 2010 Annual General Meeting on July 23, 2010.
866374_11_ITEM8_P68_S2	Since the adoption of the 2010 Plan, no further awards are made under the Prior Plans and ordinary shares available for future grant under such Prior Plans became available for grant under the 2010 Plan including shares subject to outstanding equity awards under such Prior Plans that become available for future grants as a result of the forfeiture, expiration or termination of such awards under the Prior Plans.
866374_11_ITEM8_P68_S3	As of March 31, 2011, the Company had approximately 56.4 million shares available for grants under the 2010 Plan.
866374_11_ITEM8_P68_S4	Options issued to employees under the 2010 Plan generally vest over four years and expire seven years from the date of grant.
866374_11_ITEM8_P68_S5	Options granted to non-employee directors expire five years from the date of grant.
866374_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	The exercise price of options granted under the Company's equity compensation plans is determined by the Company's Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and may not be less than the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant.
866374_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Company grants share bonus awards under its equity compensation plans.
866374_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	Share bonus awards are rights to acquire a specified number of ordinary shares for no cash consideration in exchange for continued service with the Company.
866374_11_ITEM8_P70_S2	Share bonus awards generally vest in installments over a three to five year period and unvested share bonus awards are forfeited upon termination of employment.
866374_11_ITEM8_P70_S3	Vesting for certain share bonus awards is contingent upon both service and performance criteria.
866374_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's stock-based compensation expense:
866374_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	As required by the authoritative guidance for stock-based compensation, management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.
866374_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary termination behavior as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
866374_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	Total stock-based compensation capitalized as part of inventory during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 was not material.
866374_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	As of March 31, 2011, the total compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted to employees under the Company's equity compensation plans, but not yet recognized, was approximately $30.9 million.
866374_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.3 years and will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_11_ITEM8_P75_S2	As of March 31, 2011, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share bonus awards granted to employees under the Company's equity compensation plans was approximately $83.9 million.
866374_11_ITEM8_P75_S3	This cost will be amortized generally on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.3 years and will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_11_ITEM8_P75_S4	Approximately $22.8 million of the unrecognized compensation cost is related to share bonus awards where vesting is contingent upon meeting both a service requirement and achievement of longer-term goals.
866374_11_ITEM8_P75_S5	As of March 31, 2011, achievement of these goals was probable for 322,500 of these awards and approximately $3.2 million of compensation expense related to the awards expected to vest was recognized in fiscal year 2011.
866374_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	Cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits (tax benefits related to the excess of proceeds from employee exercises of stock options over the stock-based compensation cost recognized for those options) are classified as financing cash flows pursuant to the authoritative guidance.
866374_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not recognize any excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow related to its equity compensation plans.
866374_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula and a single option award approach.
866374_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
866374_11_ITEM8_P77_S2	The fair market value of share bonus awards granted is the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant and is generally recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.
866374_11_ITEM8_P77_S3	For share bonus awards where vesting is contingent upon both a service and a performance condition, compensation expense is recognized on a graded attribute basis over the respective requisite service period of the award when achievement of the performance condition is considered probable.
866374_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	Expected Term The Company's expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation method represents the period that the Company's stock options are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock options, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock options.
866374_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	Expected Volatility The Company's expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes valuation method is derived from a combination of implied volatility related to publicly traded options to purchase Flextronics ordinary shares and historical variability in the Company's periodic stock price.
866374_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	Expected Dividend The Company has never paid dividends on its ordinary shares and currently does not intend to do so in the near term, and accordingly, the dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.
866374_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities issued with a term equivalent to the expected term of the option.
866374_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	The fair value of the Company's stock options granted to employees for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, other than those granted in connection with the option exchange in fiscal year 2010 and those with market criteria discussed below, was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	Options granted during the 2011, 2010 and 2009 fiscal years had contractual lives of seven years.
866374_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	During the 2009 fiscal year, 2.7 million options were granted to certain key employees which vest over a period of four years.
866374_11_ITEM8_P84_S1	These options expire seven years from the date of grant and are exercisable only when the Company's stock price is $12.50 per share, or above.
866374_11_ITEM8_P84_S2	The fair value of these options was estimated to be $4.25 per option and were calculated using a lattice model.
866374_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	On July 14, 2009, the Company launched an exchange offer under which eligible employees had the opportunity to voluntarily exchange their eligible outstanding stock options for a lesser amount of replacement stock options with new exercise prices equal to the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of exchange (the "Exchange").
866374_11_ITEM8_P85_S1	The Exchange offer was not open to the Company's Board of Directors or its executive officers.
866374_11_ITEM8_P85_S2	To be eligible for exchange an option must: (i) have had an exercise price of at least $10.00 per share, (ii) have been outstanding, and (iii) have been granted at least 12 months prior to the commencement date of the Exchange offer.
866374_11_ITEM8_P85_S3	All replacement option grants were subject to a vesting schedule of two, three or four years from the date of grant of the replacement options depending on the remaining vesting period of the option grants surrendered for cancellation in the Exchange.
866374_11_ITEM8_P85_S4	Stock options with exercise prices between $10.00 and $11.99 were exchangeable for new options at a rate of 1.5 existing options per new option grant, and stock options with exercise prices of $12.00 or more were exchangeable at a rate of 2.4 existing options per new option grant.

866374_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	Of the unvested share bonus awards granted under the Company's equity compensation plans during fiscal year 2011, 1,200,000 represents the target amount of grants made to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting a certain market condition.
866374_11_ITEM8_P94_S1	The number of shares that ultimately will vest are based on a measurement of Flextronics's total shareholder return against the Standard and Poor's ("S P") 500 Composite Index.
866374_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	These awards vest over a period of four years, subject to achievement of total shareholder return levels relative to the S P 500 Composite Index.
866374_11_ITEM8_P95_S1	The grant-date fair value of these awards was estimated to be $7.32 per share and was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation.

866374_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution from stock options, share bonus awards and convertible securities.
866374_11_ITEM8_P100_S1	The potential dilution from stock options exercisable into ordinary share equivalents and share bonus awards was computed using the treasury stock method based on the average fair market value of the Company's ordinary shares for the period.
866374_11_ITEM8_P100_S2	The potential dilution from the conversion spread (excess of conversion value over face value) of the Subordinated Notes convertible into ordinary share equivalents was calculated as the quotient of the conversion spread and the average fair market value of the Company's ordinary shares for the period.

866374_11_ITEM8_P137_S0	As of March 31, 2011, the aggregate notional amount of the Company's outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts was $2.4 billion as summarized below:
866374_11_ITEM8_P138_S0	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the Company's short-term foreign currency contracts was not material and included in other current assets or other current liabilities, as applicable, in the consolidated balance sheet.
866374_11_ITEM8_P138_S1	Certain of these contracts are designed to economically hedge the Company's exposure to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a non-functional currency and are not accounted for as hedges under the accounting standards.
866374_11_ITEM8_P138_S2	Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change as a component of interest and other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
866374_11_ITEM8_P138_S3	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company also has included net deferred gains and losses, respectively, in other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet, relating to changes in fair value of its foreign currency contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
866374_11_ITEM8_P138_S4	These deferred gains and losses were not material, and the deferred losses as of March 31, 2011 are expected to be recognized as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations primarily over the next twelve month period.
866374_11_ITEM8_P138_S5	The gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness were not material for all fiscal years presented and are included as a component of interest and other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
866374_11_ITEM8_P139_S0	The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities related to foreign currency contracts measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, aggregated by level in the fair-value hierarchy within which those measurements fall:
866374_11_ITEM8_P140_S0	There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.
866374_11_ITEM8_P141_S0	The Company's foreign currency forward contracts are measured on a recurring basis at fair value based on foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by banks or foreign currency dealers.
866374_11_ITEM8_P142_S0	The following table presents the fair value of the Company's derivative instruments located on the Consolidated Balance Sheets utilized for foreign currency risk management purposes at March 31, 2011 and 2010:
866374_11_ITEM8_P143_S0	The Company is exposed to variability in cash flows associated with changes in short-term interest rates primarily on borrowings under its revolving credit facility and Term Loan Agreement.
866374_11_ITEM8_P143_S1	During fiscal years 2009 and 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the exposure to interest rate risk resulting from unfavorable changes in interest rates resulting from the Term Loan Agreement.
866374_11_ITEM8_P143_S2	All of the interest rate swap agreements expired by January 2011.
866374_11_ITEM8_P144_S0	The Company's interest rate swap agreements were accounted for as cash flow hedges, and no portion of the swaps were considered ineffective.
866374_11_ITEM8_P144_S1	For fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, the net amount recorded as interest expense from these swaps was not material.
866374_11_ITEM8_P144_S2	At March 31, 2010, the fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps were not material and were included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding decrease in other comprehensive income.
866374_11_ITEM8_P144_S3	The deferred losses included in other comprehensive income were released through earnings as the Company made fixed, and received variable, interest payments over the term of the swaps.
866374_11_ITEM8_P145_S0	The Company sells trade receivables under two asset-backed securitization programs and under an accounts receivable factoring program.
866374_11_ITEM8_P146_S0	The Company continuously sells designated pools of trade receivables under its Global Asset-Backed Securitization Agreement (the "Global Program") and its North American Asset-Backed Securitization Agreement (the "North American Program," collectively, the "ABS Programs") to affiliated special purpose entities, which in turn sells 100% of the receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions.
866374_11_ITEM8_P146_S1	These programs allow the operating subsidiaries to receive a cash payment and a deferred purchase price receivable for sold receivables.
866374_11_ITEM8_P146_S2	Following the transfer of the receivables to the special purpose entities, the transferred receivables are isolated from the Company and its affiliates, and upon the sale of the receivables form the special purpose entity to the unaffiliated financial institutions effective control of the transferred receivables is passed to the unaffiliated financial institutions, which has the right to pledge or sell the receivables.
866374_11_ITEM8_P146_S3	Although the special purpose entities are consolidated by the Company, they are separate corporate entities and their assets are available first to satisfy the claims of their creditors.
866374_11_ITEM8_P146_S4	The investment limits by the financial institutions are $500.0 million for the Global Program and $300.0 million for the North American Program and require a minimum level of deferred purchase price receivable to be retained by the Company in connection with the sales.
866374_11_ITEM8_P147_S0	The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the special purpose entities and receives a servicing fee of 0.5% to 1.00% of serviced receivables per annum.
866374_11_ITEM8_P147_S1	Servicing fees recognized during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were not material and are included in Interest and other expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
866374_11_ITEM8_P147_S2	As the Company estimates the fee it receives in return for its obligation to service these receivables is at fair value, no servicing assets and liabilities are recognized.
866374_11_ITEM8_P148_S0	Effective April 1, 2010, the Company adopted two new accounting standards, the first of which removed the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and created more stringent conditions for reporting the transfer of a financial asset as a sale.
866374_11_ITEM8_P148_S1	The second standard amended the consolidation guidance for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.
866374_11_ITEM8_P148_S2	As a result of the adoption of the second standard, the Company was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the special purpose entity to which the pool of trade receivables was sold under the Global Program and, as such, was required to consolidate the special purpose entity; the Company had previously been consolidating the special purpose entity under the North American Program.
866374_11_ITEM8_P148_S3	The North American Program was amended effective April 1, 2010 and the Global Program was amended effective September 29, 2010 in each case to provide for the sale by the special purpose entities of 100% of the eligible receivables to the unaffiliated financial institutions; previously the special purpose entities had retained a partial interest in the sold receivables.
866374_11_ITEM8_P148_S4	Upon adoption of these standards, the balance of receivables sold for cash under the Global Program as of April 1, 2010, totaling $217.1 million, was recorded as accounts receivables and short-term bank borrowings in the opening balance sheet of fiscal 2011.
866374_11_ITEM8_P148_S5	Upon collection of these receivables the Company recorded cash from operations offset by repayments of bank borrowings from financing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows during the year ended March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM8_P149_S0	September 29, 2010, all of the receivables sold to the unaffiliated financial institutions for cash are removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and the cash received is no longer accounted for as a secured borrowing.
866374_11_ITEM8_P149_S1	The portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid by the unaffiliated financial institutions in cash is a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid to the special purpose entity as payments on the receivables are collected from account debtors.
866374_11_ITEM8_P149_S2	The deferred purchase price receivable represents a beneficial interest in the transferred financial assets and is recognized at fair value as part of the sale transaction.
866374_11_ITEM8_P150_S0	As of March 31, 2011, approximately $1.0 billion of accounts receivable had been sold to the special purchase entities under the ABS Programs for which the Company had received net cash proceeds of $545.0 million and deferred purchase price receivables of approximately $460.0 million.
866374_11_ITEM8_P150_S1	The deferred purchase price receivables are included in other current assets as of March 31, 2011 and are valued using unobservable inputs (i.e., level three inputs), primarily discounted cash flow, and due to its high credit quality and short maturity their fair value approximated book value.
866374_11_ITEM8_P150_S2	There were no write-offs, fair value adjustments or other transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy for the deferred purchase price receivables during the year ended March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM8_P150_S3	As of March 31, 2010, approximately $709.4 million of accounts receivable had been sold to the special purchase entities for which the Company had received net cash proceeds of $417.1 million and retained interests of approximately $135.4 million.
866374_11_ITEM8_P150_S4	Retained interests consisted primarily of the Company's investment participation in the sold receivables and were carried at the expected recovery amount of the related receivables; such amounts were included in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
866374_11_ITEM8_P150_S5	The remaining trade receivables transferred into the special purpose entities and not sold were included in trade accounts receivable, net in the March 31, 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company.
866374_11_ITEM8_P151_S0	The accounts receivable balances that were sold under the ABS Programs were removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the net cash proceeds received by the Company were included as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
866374_11_ITEM8_P151_S1	The difference between the carrying amount of the receivables sold under these programs and the sum of the cash and fair value of the other assets received at time of transfer is recognized as a loss on sale of the related receivables and recorded in Interest and other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations; such amounts were $8.0 million, $7.8 million and $14.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM8_P152_S0	For the year ended March 31, 2011, cash flows from sales of receivables in which the Company maintained a continuing involvement as a result of the deferred purchase price (the Global Program beginning September 2010 and the North American Program throughout the year) consisted of approximately $2.4 billion for transfers of receivables (of which approximately $0.6 billion represented new transfers and the remainder proceeds from collections reinvested in revolving-period transfers) and approximately $2.8 billion for collections on the deferred purchase price assets received upon the initial transfers.
866374_11_ITEM8_P152_S1	For the years ending March 31, 2010 and 2009, the Global Program and North American Program had requirements that resulted in some form of continuing involvement in the transferred assets.
866374_11_ITEM8_P152_S2	Cash flows from the transfer of receivables for these years were approximately $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion respectively (of which approximately $1.0 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, represents new transfers with the remainder of the proceeds from collections being reinvested in revolving-period transfers) and approximately $2.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, represented collections on the interests retained at the time of the initial transfer.
866374_11_ITEM8_P153_S0	year's disclosed amounts to exclude approximately $2.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of revolving period transfers that did not result in cash flows.
866374_11_ITEM8_P153_S1	This change had no effect on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations and Statements of Cash Flows.
866374_11_ITEM8_P154_S0	The Company also sold accounts receivables to certain third-party banking institutions.
866374_11_ITEM8_P154_S1	The outstanding balance of receivables sold and not yet collected was approximately $109.7 million and $164.2 million as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM8_P154_S2	For the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, total accounts receivables sold to certain third party banking institutions was approximately $2.5 billion, $1.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM8_P154_S3	The receivables that were sold were removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
866374_11_ITEM8_P154_S4	This arrangement was amended to allow sold accounts receivable to continue to be removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon the adoption of a new accounting standard on April 1, 2010.
866374_11_ITEM8_P155_S0	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the gross carrying amount and associated accumulated depreciation of the Company's property and equipment financed under capital leases, and the related obligations was not material.
866374_11_ITEM8_P155_S1	The Company also leases certain of its facilities under non-cancelable operating leases.
866374_11_ITEM8_P155_S2	These operating leases expire in various years through 2028 and require the following minimum lease payments:
866374_11_ITEM8_P156_S0	Total rent expense amounted to $153.2 million, $143.2 million and $139.2 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM8_P157_S0	On June 4, 2007, a shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court.
866374_11_ITEM8_P157_S1	The lawsuit arises out of the merger with Solectron Corp. in 2007 and other defendants include selected officers of the Company, Solectron and Solectron's former directors and officers.
866374_11_ITEM8_P157_S2	The plaintiffs seek compensatory, rescissory, and other forms of damages, as well as attorneys' fees and costs.
866374_11_ITEM8_P157_S3	The plaintiffs do not seek a jury trial.
866374_11_ITEM8_P158_S0	Solectron shareholders that were entitled to vote and receive cash or shares of the Company's stock in exchange for their shares of Solectron stock following the merger.
866374_11_ITEM8_P158_S1	On February 25, 2011 the Court denied the plaintiff's request to amend the class definition.
866374_11_ITEM8_P159_S0	The Company believes that the claims are without merit.
866374_11_ITEM8_P160_S0	In addition, from time to time, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
866374_11_ITEM8_P160_S1	The Company defends itself vigorously against any such claims.
866374_11_ITEM8_P160_S2	Although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
866374_11_ITEM8_P161_S0	The domestic ("Singapore") and foreign components of income before income taxes were comprised of the following:
866374_11_ITEM8_P162_S0	The provision for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following:
866374_11_ITEM8_P163_S0	The domestic statutory income tax rate was approximately 17.0% in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009.
866374_11_ITEM8_P163_S1	The reconciliation of the income tax expense (benefit) expected based on domestic statutory income tax rates to the expense (benefit) for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows:
866374_11_ITEM8_P164_S0	A number of countries in which the Company is located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business.
866374_11_ITEM8_P164_S1	In general, these holidays were secured based on the nature, size and location of the Company's operations.
866374_11_ITEM8_P164_S2	The aggregate dollar effect on the Company's income resulting from tax holidays and tax incentives to attract and retain business for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $66.5 million, $65.4 million and $85.3 million, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM8_P164_S3	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share was $0.09 and $0.08, respectively, and the effect on basic and diluted loss per share during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were $0.08 and $0.10, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM8_P165_S0	Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, the Company's existing holidays will expire in the fiscal years ending March 31, 2012 through fiscal 2018.
866374_11_ITEM8_P166_S0	The components of deferred income taxes are as follows:
866374_11_ITEM8_P167_S0	The Company has tax loss carryforwards of approximately $7.9 billion, a portion of which begin expiring in 2012.
866374_11_ITEM8_P167_S1	Utilization of the tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets is limited by the future earnings of the Company in the tax jurisdictions in which such deferred assets arose.
866374_11_ITEM8_P167_S2	As a result, management is uncertain as to when or whether these operations will generate sufficient profit to realize any benefit from the deferred tax assets.
866374_11_ITEM8_P168_S0	The valuation allowance provides a reserve against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized by the Company.
866374_11_ITEM8_P168_S1	However, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize certain of these benefits and, accordingly, has recognized a deferred tax asset from these benefits.
866374_11_ITEM8_P168_S2	The change in valuation allowance is net of certain increases and decreases to prior year losses and other carryforwards that have no current impact on the tax provision.
866374_11_ITEM8_P168_S3	Approximately $34.0 million of the valuation allowance relates to income tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options, which if realized will be credited directly to shareholders' equity and will not be available to benefit the income tax provision in any future period.
866374_11_ITEM8_P169_S0	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced or increased in the near-term if facts, including the amount of taxable income or the mix of taxable income between subsidiaries, differ from management's estimates.
866374_11_ITEM8_P170_S0	The Company does not provide for income taxes on approximately $500.0 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of March 31, 2011, as such earnings are not intended by management to be repatriated in the foreseeable future.
866374_11_ITEM8_P170_S1	Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
866374_11_ITEM8_P171_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
866374_11_ITEM8_P172_S0	The Company's unrecognized tax benefits are subject to change over the next twelve months primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and as audits are settled.
866374_11_ITEM8_P172_S1	The Company is not currently aware of any such changes that may have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
866374_11_ITEM8_P173_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file federal, state, and local income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions around world.
866374_11_ITEM8_P173_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2000.
866374_11_ITEM8_P174_S0	The entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2011, may affect the annual effective tax rate if the benefits are eventually recognized.
866374_11_ITEM8_P175_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within the Company's tax expense.
866374_11_ITEM8_P175_S1	During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized interest of approximately $5.0 million and $5.3 million, respectively, and no penalties.
866374_11_ITEM8_P175_S2	The Company had approximately $5.5 million and $66.8 million accrued for the payment of interest as of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM8_P175_S3	The Company had $0 and $0.3 million accrued for the payment of penalties for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM8_P176_S0	Historically, the Company has initiated a series of restructuring activities intended to realign the Company's global capacity and infrastructure with demand by its customers so as to optimize the operational efficiency, which included reducing excess workforce and capacity, and consolidating and relocating certain manufacturing, design and administrative facilities to lower-cost regions.
866374_11_ITEM8_P177_S0	The restructuring costs include employee severance, costs related to leased facilities, owned facilities that are no longer in use and are to be disposed of, leased equipment that is no longer in use and will be disposed of, and other costs associated with the exit of certain contractual agreements due to facility closures.
866374_11_ITEM8_P177_S1	The overall intent of these activities is that the Company shifts its manufacturing capacity to locations with higher efficiencies and, in most instances, lower costs, and better utilize its overall existing manufacturing capacity.
866374_11_ITEM8_P177_S2	This would enhance the Company's ability to provide cost-effective manufacturing service offerings, which in turn may enhance its ability to retain and expand the Company's existing relationships with customers and attract new business.
866374_11_ITEM8_P178_S0	The Company did not undertake any restructuring activities during fiscal year 2011 and has completed essentially all activities associated with previously announced plans.
866374_11_ITEM8_P179_S0	The following table summarizes the provisions, respective payments, and remaining accrued balance as of March 31, 2011 for charges incurred in fiscal year 2010 and prior periods:
866374_11_ITEM8_P180_S0	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, accrued costs related to restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2010 were approximately $2.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively, the entire amount of which was classified as current.
866374_11_ITEM8_P181_S0	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, accrued restructuring costs for charges incurred during fiscal year 2009 and prior were approximately $27.2 million and $50.6 million, respectively, of which approximately $12.5 million and $22.2 million, respectively, was classified as a long-term obligation.
866374_11_ITEM8_P182_S0	As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, assets that were no longer in use and held for sale as a result of restructuring activities totaled approximately $27.1 million and $46.9 million, respectively, representing manufacturing facilities that have been closed as part of the Company's facility consolidations.
866374_11_ITEM8_P182_S1	These assets are recorded at the lesser of carrying value or fair value, which is based on comparable sales from prevailing market data.
866374_11_ITEM8_P182_S2	For assets held for sale, depreciation ceases and an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.
866374_11_ITEM8_P182_S3	Assets held for sale are included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
866374_11_ITEM8_P183_S0	The Company recognized restructuring charges of approximately $107.5 million during fiscal year 2010 primarily to rationalize the Company's global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure due to the recent macroeconomic crisis which significantly impacted our customers' businesses.
866374_11_ITEM8_P183_S1	The Company's restructuring activities were intended to improve its operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce and capacity.
866374_11_ITEM8_P183_S2	In addition to the cost reductions, these activities resulted in a further shift of manufacturing capacity to locations with higher efficiencies and, in most instances, lower costs.
866374_11_ITEM8_P183_S3	The costs associated with these restructuring activities included employee severance, costs related to owned and leased facilities and equipment that is no longer in use and is to be disposed of, and other costs associated with the exit of certain contractual arrangements due to facility closures.
866374_11_ITEM8_P183_S4	The Company classified approximately $92.4 million of these charges as cost of sales and approximately $15.1 million of these charges as selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal year 2010.
866374_11_ITEM8_P184_S0	The components of the restructuring charges during fiscal year 2010 were as follows:
866374_11_ITEM8_P185_S0	During fiscal year 2010, the Company recognized approximately $41.2 million of employee termination costs associated with the involuntary terminations of 5,727 identified employees in connection with the charges described above.
866374_11_ITEM8_P185_S1	The identified involuntary employee terminations by reportable geographic region amounted to approximately 2,086, 2,740, and 901 for Asia, the Americas and Europe, respectively.
866374_11_ITEM8_P185_S2	Approximately $35.2 million of these charges were classified as a component of cost of sales.
866374_11_ITEM8_P186_S0	During fiscal year 2010, the Company recognized approximately $43.1 million of non-cash charges for the write-down of property and equipment to management's estimate of fair value associated with various manufacturing and administrative facility closures.
866374_11_ITEM8_P186_S1	Approximately $33.4 million of this amount was classified as a component of cost of sales.
866374_11_ITEM8_P186_S2	The restructuring charges recognized during fiscal year 2010 also included approximately $23.2 million for other exit costs, all of which were classified as a component of cost of sales.

866374_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

866374_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was adequately designed and operating effectively as of March 31, 2011.
866374_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements or prevent or detect instances of fraud.
866374_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
866374_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
866374_11_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

866374_11_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
866374_11_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
866374_11_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
866374_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

866374_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
866374_11_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

866374_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	Rigid and Flexible Printed Circuit Board ("PCB") Fabrication .
866374_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Printed circuit boards are platforms composed of laminated materials that provide the interconnection for integrated circuits, passive and other electronic components and thus are at the heart of most every electrical system.
866374_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	They are formed out of multi-layered epoxy resin and glass cloth systems with very fine traces and spaces and plated holes (called vias), which interconnect the different layers to an extreme dense circuitry network that carries the integrated circuits and electrical signals.
866374_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	As semiconductor designs become more and more complex and signal speeds increase, there is an increasing demand on printed circuit board integration density requiring higher layer counts, finer lines and spacings, smaller vias (microvias) and base materials with electrically very low loss characteristics.
866374_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	The manufacturing of these complex multilayer interconnect products often requires the use of sophisticated circuit interconnections between layers, and adherence to strict electrical characteristics to maintain consistent circuit transmission speeds and impedances.
866374_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	The global demand for wireless devices and the complexity of wireless products are driving the demand for more flexible printed circuits.
866374_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Flexible circuit boards facilitate a reduction in the weight of a finished electronic product and allow the designer to use the third dimension in designing new products or product features.
866374_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	Flexible circuits have become a very attractive design alternative for many new and emerging application spaces such as automotive rear LED lightning, tablet computers, camera modules and miniaturized radio frequency identification tags or smart cards.

866374_12_ITEM1_P48_S3	We believe that the following capabilities differentiate us from our competitors and enable us to better serve our customers' requirements:
866374_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Geographic, Customer and End Market Diversification.
866374_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	We believe that we have created a well-diversified and balanced company.
866374_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	We have diversified our business across multiple end markets, significantly expanding our available market.

866374_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	Operating and executing this complex worldwide solutions system is a competitive advantage.
866374_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	We have an industry leading global design service offering with extensive product design engineering resources that provide global design services, products, and solutions to satisfy a wide array of customer requirements across all of our key markets.
866374_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	We combine our design and manufacturing services to provide end-to-end customized solutions that include services from design layout, through product industrialization and product development, including the manufacture of vertically-integrated components and complete products (such as smart phones), which are then sold by our OEM customers under the OEMs' brand names.

866374_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	We have developed self-contained campuses that co-locate our manufacturing and logistics operations with our suppliers at a single, low-cost location.
866374_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	These industrial parks enhance our total supply chain management, while providing a low-cost, multi-technology solution for our customers.
866374_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	This approach increases the competitiveness of our customers by reducing logistical barriers and costs, improving communications, increasing flexibility, lowering transportation costs and reducing turnaround times.
866374_12_ITEM1_P55_S3	We have strategically established our large industrial parks in Brazil, China, Hungary, Israel, Mexico, Romania and Poland.

866374_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	We believe that maintaining our long-term relationships with key customers is a critical requirement for maintaining our market position, growth and profitability.
866374_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	We believe that our ability to maintain and grow these customer relationships results from our ability to continuously create value that increases our customers' competitiveness.

866374_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	We have focused on establishing long-term relationships with our customers and have been successful in expanding our relationships to incorporate additional product lines and services.
866374_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	In fiscal year 2012, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 55% of net sales.
866374_12_ITEM1_P58_S3	Our largest customers during fiscal year 2012 were Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Research In Motion (RIM), which each accounted for more than 10% of net sales.
866374_12_ITEM1_P58_S4	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2012.
866374_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	The following table lists in alphabetical order a sample of our largest customers in fiscal year 2012 and the end products of those customers for which we provide design, manufacturing or after-market services:
866374_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Although we obtain firm purchase orders from our customers, OEM customers typically do not make firm orders for delivery of products more than 30 to 90 days in advance.
866374_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	In addition, OEM customers may reschedule or cancel firm orders based upon contractual arrangements.
866374_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	Therefore, we do not believe that the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales.
866374_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our market is extremely competitive and includes many companies, several of which have achieved substantial market share.
866374_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	We compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturing service providers, as well as our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	We face particular competition from Asian based competitors, including Taiwanese ODM suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	We compete with different companies depending on the type of service we are providing or the geographic area in which an activity takes place.
866374_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	manufacturing services market are: quality and range of services; design and technological capabilities; cost; location of facilities; responsiveness and flexibility.
866374_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our corporate social responsibility practices focus on global human rights, global environmental conditions, business ethics, and the health and safety of all stakeholders.
866374_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	We do this with controlled business processes, thus ensuring that our business is conducted in a manner that goes beyond compliance alone.
866374_12_ITEM1_P64_S2	We operate programs, including compliance audits and compliance capability building programs, that focus on driving continuous improvements in social, ethical, and environmental compliance throughout all of our global operating units in accordance with our Code of Conduct.
866374_12_ITEM1_P64_S3	As a guide to achieve this end, Flextronics looks at principles, policies, and standards as prescribed by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition ("EICC"), a worldwide association of electronics companies committed to promoting an industry code of conduct for global electronics supply chains to improve working and environmental conditions.
866374_12_ITEM1_P64_S4	Flextronics is a founding member of the EICC coalition.
866374_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	Being a good corporate citizen does not mean that we should merely conform to the standards.
866374_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	We extend beyond meeting responsibilities by offering a wide range of programs and initiatives that engage our internal and external communities.
866374_12_ITEM1_P65_S2	At the heart of this endeavor lies our pragmatic goal of creating a difference to the people in the community in which we operate.
866374_12_ITEM1_P65_S3	We intend to continue to invest in these global communities through grant-making, financial contributions, volunteer work, support programs and by donating resources.
866374_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	As of March 31, 2012, our global workforce totaled approximately 159,000 employees.
866374_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by work councils.
866374_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	We have never experienced a significant work stoppage or strike, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
866374_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees.
866374_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	The loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business, results of operations and business prospects.
866374_12_ITEM1_P67_S2	To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel.
866374_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
866374_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	We have compliance processes and procedures in place to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.
866374_12_ITEM1_P68_S2	We do not believe that costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating results, or competitive position.
866374_12_ITEM1_P68_S3	In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third-party sites.
866374_12_ITEM1_P68_S4	We engage environmental consulting firms to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities of our ongoing operations, historical disposal activities and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements.
866374_12_ITEM1_P68_S5	We determine the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the probability of occurrence and the reasonable possibility of incurring costs in light of information currently available.
866374_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	While no material exposures have been identified to date that we are aware of, there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known.
866374_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	EU Directive REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemicals), and China RoHS entitled, Management Methods for Controlling Pollution for Electronic Information Products ("EIPs").
866374_12_ITEM1_P70_S2	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States.
866374_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our business requires close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to mitigate risk of non-compliance.
866374_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as the regulations.
866374_12_ITEM1_P71_S2	These programs vary from collecting compliance data from our Flextronics owned suppliers to full laboratory testing, and we require our supply chain to comply.
866374_12_ITEM1_P71_S3	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	In the case of WEEE, although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations.
866374_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	We own or license various United States and foreign patents relating to a variety of technologies.
866374_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	For certain of our proprietary processes, we rely on trade secret protection.
866374_12_ITEM1_P73_S2	We also have registered our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the United States and other countries throughout the world.
866374_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying value of our intellectual property was not material.
866374_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	Although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it, from time to time third parties do assert patent infringement claims against us or our customers.
866374_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	In addition, we are increasingly providing design and engineering services to our customers and designing and making our own products.
866374_12_ITEM1_P75_S2	As a consequence of these activities, our customers are requiring us to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses.
866374_12_ITEM1_P75_S3	If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_12_ITEM1_P75_S4	Such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor.
866374_12_ITEM1_P75_S5	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome.
866374_12_ITEM1_P75_S6	We also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services.
866374_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	Refer to note 17, "Segment Reporting," to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for financial information about our geographic areas.
866374_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
866374_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	We were incorporated in the Republic of Singapore in May 1990.
866374_12_ITEM1_P78_S1	Our principal corporate office is located at 2 Changi South Lane, Singapore 486123.
866374_12_ITEM1_P78_S2	Our U.S. corporate headquarters is located at 847 Gibraltar Drive, Milpitas, CA, 95035.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We depend on industries that continually produce technologically advanced products with short life cycles and our business would be adversely affected if our customers' products are not successful or if our customers lose market share.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We derive our revenues from customers in the following markets:
866374_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	High Reliability Solutions (HRS), which is comprised of our medical, automotive, defense and aerospace businesses; High Velocity Solutions (HVS), which includes our mobile/smart phone business, consumer electronics including game consoles and printers, enterprise PC business, and our ODM personal computing business which we exited in the third quarter of fiscal 2012; Industrial and Emerging Industries (IEI), which is comprised of our industrial, semiconductor capital equipment and clean technology businesses; and Integrated Network Solutions (INS), which includes our telecommunications infrastructure, data networking, connected home, and server and storage businesses.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Factors affecting any of these industries in general or our customers in particular, could adversely impact us.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	rapid changes in technology, evolving industry standards and requirements for continuous improvement in products and services result in short product life cycles; demand for our customers' products may be seasonal; our customers may fail to successfully market their products, and our customers' products may fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance; our customers may experience dramatic market share shifts in demand which may cause them to exit the business; and there may be recessionary periods in our customers' markets, such as the recent global economic downturn.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and the inherent difficulties involved in responding to these demands could harm our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers have harmed, and may continue to harm, our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and deliver for these customers, by causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and by lowering our asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Additionally, current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our capabilities against other providers as well as against the merits of manufacturing products themselves.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our business would be adversely affected if OEMs decide to perform these functions internally or transfer their business to another provider.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	As a provider of electronics design and manufacturing services and components, we must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround time for our customers.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and we often experience reduced lead times in customer orders which may be less than the lead time we require to procure necessary components and materials.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of our customers.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In that regard, we must make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, setting production schedules, making component procurement commitments, and allocating personnel and other resources, based on our estimates of our customers' requirements.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production or require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to reduce costs or achieve other objectives.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These demands stress our resources and reduce our margins.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands, and transfers from one facility to another can result in inefficiencies and costs due to excess capacity in one facility and corresponding capacity constraints at another.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Due to many of our costs and operating expenses being relatively fixed, customer order fluctuations, deferrals and transfers of demand from one facility to another, as described above, have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past and we may experience such effects in the future.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our industry is extremely competitive; if we are not able to continue to provide competitive services, we may lose business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We compete with a number of different companies, depending on the type of service we provide or the location of our operations.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	For example, we compete with major global EMS providers, other smaller EMS companies that have a regional or product-specific focus, and ODMs with respect to some of the services that we provide.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We also compete with our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our industry is extremely competitive, many of our competitors have achieved substantial market share, and some may have lower cost structures or greater design, manufacturing, financial or other resources than we do.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We face particular competition from Asian-based competitors, including Taiwanese ODM suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	If we are unable to provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at lower cost than the other companies in our market, our net sales could decline.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a decline in sales to any of these customers could adversely affect our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Sales to our ten largest customers represent a significant percentage of our net sales.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 55%, 52% and 47% of net sales in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our largest customers during fiscal 2012 were Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Research In Motion (RIM), which each accounted for more than 10% of net sales.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2012.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our largest customer during fiscal year 2011 was Research In Motion, and our largest customer during fiscal year 2010 was Hewlett-Packard, each of which accounted for more than 10% of net sales in the respective fiscal year.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal years 2011 or 2010.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our principal customers have varied from year to year.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These customers may experience dramatic declines in their market shares or competitive position, due to economic or other forces, that may cause them to reduce their purchases from us or, in some cases, result in the termination of their relationship with us.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If we are not able to timely replace expired, canceled or reduced contracts with new business, our revenues and profitability could be harmed.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our components business is dependent on our ability to quickly launch world-class components products, and our investment in the development of our component capabilities, together with the start-up and integration costs necessary to achieve quick launches of world-class components products, may adversely affect our margins and profitability.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our components business, which includes rigid and flexible printed circuit board fabrication, power supplies and display and touch design manufacturing, is part of our strategy to improve our competitive position and to grow our future margins, profitability and shareholder returns by expanding our vertical-integration capabilities.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The success of our components business is dependent on our ability to design and introduce world-class components that have performance characteristics which are suitable for a broad market and that offer significant price and/or performance advantages over competitive products.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	To create these world class components offerings, we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our components capabilities, in resources such as research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, facility expansions and personnel requirements.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We may not be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance for any of our components offerings in any of our current or target markets.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The success of our components business will also depend upon the level of market acceptance of our customers' end products, which incorporate our components, and over which we have no control.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In addition, OEMs often require unique configurations or custom designs which must be developed and integrated in the OEM's product well before the product is launched by the OEM.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Thus, there is often substantial lead time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized component and the commencement of volume shipments of the component to the OEM.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	As a result, we may make substantial investments in the development and customization of products for our customers, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not accept the customized component.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Even if our customers accept the customized component, if our customers do not purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our achievement of anticipated levels of profitability in our components business is also dependent on our ability to achieve efficiencies in our manufacturing as well as to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our OEM customers.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability in our components business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our products from these customers could decline.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty we could have difficulty sourcing supply necessary to fulfil production requirements and meet scheduled shipments.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivable are outstanding.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We may be adversely affected by shortages of required electronic components.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	From time to time, we have experienced shortages of some of the electronic components that we use.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These shortages can result from strong demand for those components or from problems experienced by suppliers, such as shortages of raw materials.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These unanticipated component shortages could result in curtailed production or delays in production, which may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a reduction in sales, increase in inventory levels and costs, and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Component shortages may also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P24_S5	As a result, component shortages could adversely affect our operating results.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to incorporate changes in component costs into the selling prices for our products.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our supply chain may also be impacted by other events outside our control, including macroeconomic events, political crises or natural or environmental occurrences.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Component shortages impacted our results during the second half of fiscal year 2010, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and during fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The supply constraints were broad based, but the impact was most evident with respect to connectors, capacitors, LCD panels and memory (both DRAM and Flash).
866374_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	These shortages began to abate during the second quarter of fiscal 2011, and supplies had normalized by the end of the third quarter.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan resulted in disruptions to our supply chain, as a large number of our suppliers of semiconductors and other electronic components are located in Japan.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P25_S5	These disruptions had a negative impact on our revenue in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P25_S6	We also continue to evaluate the extent of the disruption to our supply chain and the impact on our business caused by the flooding in Thailand during the second half of 2011, which had a negative impact on our revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, as a number of our suppliers of hard disk drives and other electronic components maintain facilities in Thailand.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our margins and profitability may be adversely affected due to substantial investments, start-up and production ramping costs in our design services.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	As part of our strategy to enhance our vertically-integrated, end-to-end service offerings, we have expanded and continue to expand our design and engineering capabilities.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Providing these services can expose us to different or greater potential risks than those we face when providing our manufacturing services.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Although we enter into contracts with our design services customers, we may design and develop products for these customers prior to receiving a purchase order or other firm commitment from them.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We are required to make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Even if our customers accept our designs, if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Our design activities often require that we purchase inventory for initial production runs before we have a purchase commitment from a customer.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Even after we have a contract with a customer with respect to a product, these contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any particular volume of purchases.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P28_S5	These contracts can generally be terminated on short notice.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P28_S6	In addition, some of the products we design and develop must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some must receive government certifications.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P28_S7	If we fail to obtain these approvals or certifications on a timely basis, we would be unable to sell these products, which would harm our sales, profitability and reputation.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Due to the increased risks associated with our design services offerings, we may not be able to achieve a high enough level of sales for this business, and the significant investments in research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, patent applications, facility expansion and recruitment that it requires, to be profitable.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The initial costs of investing in the resources necessary to expand our design and engineering capabilities, and in particular to support our design services offerings, have historically adversely affected our profitability, and may continue to do so as we continue to make investments in these capabilities.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In addition, we agree to certain product price limitations and cost reduction targets in order to achieve anticipated margins and profitable operations.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Inflationary and other increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor required to produce the products have occurred and may recur from time to time.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Also, the production ramps for these programs are typically significant and negatively impact our margin in early stages as the manufacturing volumes are lower and result in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We may not be able to reduce costs, incorporate changes in costs into the selling prices of our products, or increase operating efficiencies as we ramp production of our products, which would adversely affect our margins and our results of operations.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for medical devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	As a medical device manufacturer, we have additional compliance requirements.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We are required to register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring by the FDA.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P32_S3	If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance with QSR or other FDA regulations, and the Company does not address the observation adequately to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA may take action against us.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P32_S4	FDA actions may include issuing a letter of inspectional observations, issuing a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the Company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, refusing requests for clearance or approval of new products or withdrawal of clearance or approval previously granted, issuing an import detention on products entering the U.S. from an offshore facility, or shutting down a manufacturing facility.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P32_S5	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In the European Union ("EU"), we are required to maintain certain standardized certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections to obtain and maintain these certifications.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Continued noncompliance to the EU regulations could stop the flow of products into the EU from us or from our customers.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In China, the Safe Food and Drug Administration controls and regulates the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We must comply with the regulatory laws applicable to medical device manufactures or our ability to manufacture products in China could be impacted.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In Japan, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws regulate the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	These regulations also require that subcontractors manufacturing products intended for sale in Japan register with authorities and submit to regulatory audits.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Other Asian countries where we operate have similar laws regarding the regulation of medical device manufacturing.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to risks of international operations.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The distances between the Americas, Asia and Europe create a number of logistical and communications challenges for us.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	components and raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations, and coordinating the activities and decisions of the core management team, which is based in a number of different countries.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Facilities in several different locations may be involved at different stages of the production of a single product, leading to additional logistical difficulties.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Because our manufacturing operations are located in a number of countries throughout the Americas, Asia and Europe, we are subject to the risks of changes in economic and political conditions in those countries, including:
866374_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	fluctuations in the value of local currencies; labor unrest, difficulties in staffing and geographic labor shortages; longer payment cycles; cultural differences; increases in duties and taxation levied on our products; imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds; limitations on imports or exports of components or assembled products, or other travel restrictions; expropriation of private enterprises; exposure to infectious disease and epidemics; and a potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The attractiveness of our services to U.S. customers can be affected by changes in U.S. trade policies, such as most favored nation status and trade preferences for some Asian countries.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In addition, some countries in which we operate, such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Mexico, Malaysia and Poland, have experienced periods of slow or negative growth, high inflation, significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Furthermore, in countries such as China and Mexico, governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy, and their actions could have a significant effect on us.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure, including lack of adequate power and water supplies, transportation, raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, we may encounter labor disruptions and rising labor costs, in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Any increase in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In some countries, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert our cash distributions to U.S. dollars or other freely convertible currencies, or to move funds from our accounts in these countries.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Furthermore, the central bank of any of these countries may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to approve distributions to foreign investors.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Another significant legal risk resulting from our international operations is compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local laws of the countries in which we do business, including the UK Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits covered companies from making payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	or to improperly influence a decision regarding Flextronics.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents will refrain from taking actions in violation of this and our related anti-corruption policies and procedures.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We are subject to the risk of increased income taxes.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We have structured our operations in a manner designed to maximize income in countries where:
866374_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	tax incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment; or income tax rates are low.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	A number of countries in which we are located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	For example, on March 16, 2007, the Chinese government passed a new unified enterprise income tax law which became effective on January 1, 2008.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Among other things, the new law canceled many income tax incentives previously applicable to our subsidiaries in China.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Under the new law, the tax rates applicable to the operations of most of our subsidiaries in China have been increased to 25%.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P48_S5	The new law provided a transition rule which increased the tax rate to 25% over a 5-year period, which ends in 2012.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P48_S6	The new law also increased the standard withholding rate on earnings distributions to between 5% and 10% depending on the residence of the shareholder.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P48_S7	The ultimate effect of these and other changes in Chinese tax laws on our overall tax rate will be affected by, among other things, our China income, the manner in which China interprets, implements and applies the new tax provisions, and our ability to qualify for any exceptions or new incentives.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P48_S8	Similarly, we recently renewed a Malaysian tax holiday that expired on January 31, 2012 for another ten year period.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P48_S9	Our continued ability to qualify for specific tax holiday extensions will depend on, among other things, our anticipated investment and expansion in these countries and the manner in which the local governments interpret the requirements for extensions or new incentives.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions around the world.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P50_S2	However, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax provision, operating results, financial position and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If our products or components contain defects, demand for our services may decline and we may be exposed to product liability and product warranty liability.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation and expose us to product liability or product warranty claims.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Product liability claims may include liability for personal injury or property damage.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Product warranty claims may include liability to pay for the recall, repair or replacement of a product or component.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	allocated liability to our customers, our customers may not have the resources to satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product or component for which they have assumed responsibility.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	If we design, engineer or manufacture a product or component that is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could spend a significant amount of money to resolve the claim.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In addition, product liability and product recall insurance coverage are expensive and may not be available with respect to all of our services offerings on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P55_S2	A successful product liability or product warranty claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied, limited or is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	If we do not effectively manage changes in our operations, our business may be harmed; we have taken substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may need to take material restructuring charges in the future.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In recent years, we have experienced growth in our business through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	However, our business also has been negatively impacted by the recent adverse global economic conditions.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The expansion of our business, as well as business contractions and other changes in our customers' requirements, have in the past, and may in the future, require that we adjust our business and cost structures, including by incurring restructuring charges.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Restructuring activities involve reductions in our workforce at some locations and closure of certain facilities.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P57_S4	All of these changes have in the past placed, and may in the future place, considerable strain on our management control systems and resources, including decision support, accounting management, information systems and facilities.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P57_S5	If we do not properly manage our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures to manage our employees, our business could be harmed.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In recent years, we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations through a series of restructuring activities, which were intended to realign our global capacity and infrastructure with demand by our OEM customers and thereby improve our operational efficiency.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	These activities included reducing excess workforce and capacity, transitioning manufacturing to lower-cost locations and eliminating redundant facilities, and consolidating and eliminating certain administrative facilities.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	While we incur severance, asset impairment charges and other facilities charges as a result of changes in our customer mix on an ongoing basis, such individual actions were not considered material to be separately disclosed as restructuring charges in fiscal 2012 and 2011, and are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	We recognized restructuring charges of approximately $107.5 million in fiscal 2010.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P59_S2	We may be required to take additional charges in the future to align our operations and cost structures with global economic conditions, market demands, cost competitiveness, and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers' production requirements.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P59_S3	We may consolidate certain manufacturing facilities or transfer certain of our operations to lower cost geographies.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P59_S4	If we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Additionally, there are other potential risks associated with our restructurings that could adversely affect us, such as delays encountered with the finalization and implementation of the restructuring activities, work stoppages, and the failure to achieve targeted cost savings.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The success of certain of our activities depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We retain certain intellectual property rights to some of the technologies that we develop as part of our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The measures we have taken to prevent unauthorized use of our technology may not be successful.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	protect our intellectual property rights, this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties, as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our customers.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	In addition, our customers are increasingly requiring us to indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P63_S2	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P63_S3	In the event of such an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P63_S4	We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our operating costs.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our manufacturing operations and industrial parks are located in lower cost regions of the world, such as Asia, Eastern Europe and Mexico; however, most of our purchase and sale transactions are denominated in United States dollars, Japanese yen or Euros.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P65_S1	As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in the functional currencies of our fixed cost overhead or our supply base relative to the currencies in which we conduct transactions.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors, including changes in a country's political and economic policies.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Volatility in the functional and non-functional currencies of our entities and the United States dollar could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The primary impact of currency exchange fluctuations is on the cash, receivables, and payables of our operating entities.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	As part of our currency hedging strategy, we use financial instruments, primarily forward purchase and swap contracts, to hedge our United States dollar and other currency commitments in order to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on current assets and liabilities.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P67_S2	If our hedging activities are not successful or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We are also exposed to risks related to the valuation of the Chinese currency relative to other foreign currencies.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The Chinese currency is the renminbi ("RMB").
866374_12_ITEM1A_P69_S1	A significant increase in the value of the RMB could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows by increasing both our manufacturing costs and the costs of our local supply base.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We depend on our executive officers and skilled management personnel.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Generally our employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P71_S3	We will need to recruit and retain skilled management personnel, and if we are not able to do so, our business could be harmed.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P71_S4	In addition, in connection with expanding our design services offerings, we must attract and retain experienced design engineers.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P71_S5	There is substantial competition in our industry for highly skilled employees.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P71_S6	Our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our design services offerings, which could adversely affect our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our failure to comply with environmental laws could adversely affect our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the recyclability of products, the materials that may be included in products, and our obligations to dispose of these products after end users have finished with them.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Additionally, we may be exposed to liability to our customers relating to the materials that may be included in the components that we procure for our customers' products.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Any violation or alleged violation by us of environmental laws could subject us to significant costs, fines or other penalties.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of global and local product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We are subject to the European Union ("EU") directives, including the Restrictions on Hazardous Substances Directive ("RoHS"), the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE") as well as the EU's Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH") regulation.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Also of note is China's Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products regulation, commonly referred to as "China RoHS", which restricts the importation into and production within China of electrical equipment containing certain hazardous materials.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P74_S4	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as applicable regulations.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P75_S1	These programs may include collecting compliance data from our suppliers, full laboratory testing and public reporting of other environmental metrics such as carbon emissions, electronic waste and water, and we also require our supply chain to comply.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P75_S3	In the case of WEEE, the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P75_S4	However, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their obligations under WEEE.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P76_S1	If more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed, or the results of future testing and analyses at our current or former operating facilities indicate that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the air, ground and/or water, we may be subject to additional liability.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Additional environmental matters may arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P76_S3	Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations or adequately address contaminated sites could limit our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to incur significant expenses, which would harm our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We may encounter difficulties with acquisitions, which could harm our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We have completed numerous acquisitions of businesses and we may acquire additional businesses in the future.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Any future acquisitions may require additional equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, or additional debt financing, which could increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P78_S3	As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In addition, the integration of acquired businesses may require that we incur significant restructuring charges.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including:
866374_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	diversion of management's attention from the normal operation of our business; potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at acquired companies; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital; lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business; and exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P83_S0	These and other factors have harmed, and in the future could harm, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our strategic relationships with major customers create risks.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P85_S0	In the past, we have completed numerous strategic transactions with OEM customers.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Under these arrangements, we generally acquire inventory, equipment and other assets from the OEM, and lease or acquire their manufacturing facilities, while simultaneously entering into multi-year supply agreements for the production of their products.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P85_S2	We may pursue these OEM divestiture transactions in the future.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P85_S3	These arrangements entered into with divesting OEMs typically involve many risks, including the following:
866374_12_ITEM1A_P86_S0	we may need to pay a purchase price to the divesting OEMs that exceed the value we ultimately may realize from the future business of the OEM; the integration of the acquired assets and facilities into our business may be time-consuming and costly, including the incurrence of restructuring charges; we, rather than the divesting OEM, bear the risk of excess capacity at the facility; we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies at the facility; we may be unable to meet the expectations of the OEM as to volume, product quality, timeliness and cost reductions; our supply agreements with the OEMs generally do not require any minimum volumes of purchase by the OEMs, and the actual volume of purchases may be less than anticipated; and if demand for the OEMs' products declines, the OEM may reduce its volume of purchases, and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other OEMs.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P87_S0	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P87_S1	In addition, these strategic arrangements have not, and in the future may not, result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings per share.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our business and operations could be adversely impacted by climate change initiatives.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Concern over climate change has led to international legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to seasonal demand.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Two of our significant end markets are the mobile devices market and the consumer devices market.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P91_S1	These markets exhibit particular strength toward the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P91_S2	As a result, we have historically experienced stronger revenues in our third fiscal quarter as compared to our other fiscal quarters.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P91_S3	Economic or other factors leading to diminished orders in the end of the calendar year could harm our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P92_S0	As of March 31, 2012, our total debt was approximately $2.2 billion.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P92_S1	This level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Weak global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and access to capital markets.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which our customers compete.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Recent adverse worldwide economic conditions, including the European sovereign debt crisis, have created challenging conditions in the electronics industry.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P95_S1	These conditions have resulted in reduced consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries, a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and high volatility in credit, fixed income and equity markets.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P96_S0	A continuation or worsening of the European sovereign debt crisis will likely have a negative effect on certain of our European customers and suppliers, which could harm our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P96_S1	In addition, longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P96_S2	If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other corporate purposes.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P97_S0	The market price of our ordinary shares is volatile.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of companies, including technology companies.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P98_S1	These fluctuations have often been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P98_S2	The market for our ordinary shares has been and may in the future be subject to similar volatility.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Factors such as fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of technological innovations or events affecting other companies in the electronics industry, currency fluctuations, general market fluctuations, and macro economic conditions may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P99_S0	If our security systems and governance policies are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P100_S0	We have implemented security systems and governance policies with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our customers' and our suppliers' confidential information.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of these security systems and governance policies which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or unauthorized use of the information we are trying to protect.
866374_12_ITEM1A_P100_S2	If unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow.
866374_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facilities consist of a global network of industrial parks, regional manufacturing operations, and design, engineering and product introduction centers, providing over 26.7 million square feet of productive capacity as of March 31, 2012.
866374_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own facilities with approximately 9.0 million square feet in Asia, 4.5 million square feet in the Americas and 2.7 million square feet in Europe.
866374_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	We lease facilities with approximately 5.7 million square feet in Asia, 2.8 million square feet in the Americas and 2.0 million square feet in Europe.
866374_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our facilities include large industrial parks, ranging in size from approximately 300,000 to 6.8 million square feet in Brazil, China, Hungary, Israel, Mexico, Romania and Poland.
866374_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also have regional manufacturing operations, generally ranging in size from under 100,000 to approximately 1.0 million square feet in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Sweden, Ukraine and the United States.
866374_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also have smaller design and engineering centers and product introduction centers at a number of locations in the world's major electronics markets.
866374_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our facilities are well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted.
866374_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	The productive capacity of our plants is adequate for current needs.
866374_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
866374_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims.
866374_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	Although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management expects that any losses that are probable or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of these matters, which are in excess of amounts already accrued in its consolidated balance sheet would not be material to the financial statements as a whole.
866374_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low per share sales prices for our ordinary shares since the beginning of fiscal year 2011 as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
866374_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of May 16, 2012 there were 3,646 holders of record of our ordinary shares and the closing sales price of our ordinary shares as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was $6.62 per share.
866374_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	Since inception, we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares.
866374_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	We presently do not have plans to pay any dividends in the near future.

866374_12_ITEM5_P8_S0	The following table provides information regarding purchases of our ordinary shares made by us for the period from January 1, 2012 through March 31, 2012.
866374_12_ITEM5_P9_S0	(1) During the period from January 1, 2012 through March 31, 2012 all purchases were made pursuant to the program discussed below in open market transactions.
866374_12_ITEM5_P9_S1	All purchases were made in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
866374_12_ITEM5_P9_S2	(2) On July 18, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our outstanding ordinary shares.
866374_12_ITEM5_P9_S3	Repurchases under our share repurchase plans are subject to an aggregate limit of 10% of our ordinary shares outstanding as of our Extraordinary General Meeting held in July 2011.
866374_12_ITEM5_P9_S4	On December 22, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of the remaining balance of ordinary shares outstanding not to exceed the 10% limitation.
866374_12_ITEM5_P9_S5	As of March 31, 2012, we had 20,379,234 shares available to be repurchased under the plans with an approximate dollar value of $141.0 million at an assumed average price of $6.92 per share.
866374_12_ITEM5_P10_S0	Singapore does not impose a withholding tax on dividends.
866374_12_ITEM5_P10_S1	All dividends are tax exempt to shareholders.
866374_12_ITEM5_P11_S0	Under current Singapore tax law there is no tax on capital gains, thus any profits from the disposal of shares are not taxable in Singapore unless the gains arising from the disposal of shares are income in nature and subject to tax, especially if they arise from activities which the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore regards as the carrying on of a trade or business in Singapore (in which case, the profits on the sale would be taxable as trade profits rather than capital gains).
866374_12_ITEM5_P12_S0	Shareholders who apply, or who are required to apply, the Singapore Financial Reporting Standard 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement ("FRS 39") for the purposes of Singapore income tax may be required to recognize gains or losses (not being gains or losses in the nature of capital) in accordance with the provisions of FRS 39 (as modified by the applicable provisions of Singapore income tax law) even though no sale or disposal of shares is made.
866374_12_ITEM5_P13_S0	There is no stamp duty payable for holding shares, and no duty is payable on the acquisition of newly-issued shares.
866374_12_ITEM5_P14_S0	When existing shares are acquired in Singapore, a stamp duty is payable on the instrument of transfer of the shares at the rate of two Singapore dollars ("S$") for every S$1,000 of the market value of the shares.
866374_12_ITEM5_P15_S0	is an agreement to the contrary.
866374_12_ITEM5_P16_S0	If the instrument of transfer is executed outside of Singapore, the stamp duty must be paid only if the instrument of transfer is received in Singapore.
866374_12_ITEM5_P17_S0	The estate duty was abolished for deaths occurring on or after February 15, 2008.
866374_12_ITEM5_P17_S1	For deaths prior to February 15, 2008 the following rules apply:
866374_12_ITEM5_P18_S0	If an individual who is not domiciled in Singapore dies on or after January 1, 2002, no estate tax is payable in Singapore on any of our shares held by the individual.
866374_12_ITEM5_P19_S0	If property passing upon the death of an individual domiciled in Singapore includes our shares, Singapore estate duty is payable to the extent that the value of the shares aggregated with any other assets subject to Singapore estate duty exceeds S$600,000.
866374_12_ITEM5_P19_S1	Unless other exemptions apply to the other assets, for example, the separate exemption limit for residential properties, any excess beyond S$600,000 will be taxed at 5% on the first S$12,000,000 of the individual's chargeable assets and thereafter at 10%.
866374_12_ITEM5_P20_S0	An individual shareholder who is a U.S. citizen or resident (for U.S. estate tax purposes) will have the value of the shares included in the individual's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes.
866374_12_ITEM5_P20_S1	An individual shareholder generally will be entitled to a tax credit against the shareholder's U.S. estate tax to the extent the individual shareholder actually pays Singapore estate tax on the value of the shares; however, such tax credit is generally limited to the percentage of the U.S. estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the value of the shares included in the shareholder's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes, adjusted further by a pro rata apportionment of available exemptions.
866374_12_ITEM5_P20_S2	Individuals who are domiciled in Singapore should consult their own tax advisors regarding the Singapore estate tax consequences of their investment.

866374_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	These historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future.
866374_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) On March 2, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain assets of its Vista Point Technologies camera module business.
866374_12_ITEM6_P1_S1	This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 subject to certain closing conditions.
866374_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	reported the results of operations and financial position of this business in discontinued operations within the statements of operations and the balance sheets for all periods presented.
866374_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	(2) On October 1, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Solectron, a provider of value-added electronics manufacturing and supply chain services to OEMs.
866374_12_ITEM6_P3_S1	The results of Solectron's operations were included in the Company's consolidated financial results beginning on the acquisition date.
866374_12_ITEM6_P3_S2	(3) Restructuring charges incurred during the 2010 and 2009 fiscal years were primarily intended to rationalize the Company's global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in response to weakened macroeconomic conditions and decline in demand from our OEM customers.
866374_12_ITEM6_P3_S3	Restructuring charges incurred during the 2008 fiscal year were primarily in connection with the acquisition and integration of Solectron.
866374_12_ITEM6_P3_S4	(4) The Company recognized a charge of $30.0 million during fiscal year 2008 for the write-off of certain intangible asset licenses due to technological obsolescence.
866374_12_ITEM6_P3_S5	(5) The Company recognized a charge to impair goodwill as a result of a significant decline in its share value driven by weakened macroeconomic conditions that contributed to a decrease in market multiples and estimated discounted cash flows.
866374_12_ITEM6_P3_S6	(6) The net other income in the fiscal year 2012, relates to the sale of certain international entities.
866374_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	During fiscal year 2011, the Company recognized a $13.2 million loss associated with the early redemption of the 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes and an $11.7 million loss in connection with the divestiture of certain international entities.
866374_12_ITEM6_P4_S1	Additionally, the Company recognized a gain of $18.6 million associated with a sale of an equity investment that was previously fully impaired.
866374_12_ITEM6_P5_S0	The Company recognized charges of $199.4 million, $111.5 million and $61.1 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for the loss on disposition, other-than-temporary impairment and other related charges on its investments in, and notes receivable from, certain non-publicly traded companies.
866374_12_ITEM6_P5_S1	In fiscal year 2009, the Company recognized a net gain of $22.3 million upon the partial extinguishment of debt.
866374_12_ITEM6_P6_S0	(7) The Company recognized non-cash tax expense of $661.3 million during fiscal year 2008, as we determined the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets was no longer more likely than not.
866374_12_ITEM6_P6_S1	(8) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company identified certain accounting errors in the statutory-to-U.S. GAAP adjustments at one of its foreign sites that originated in prior annual periods.
866374_12_ITEM6_P6_S2	Management conducted additional procedures and concluded that these errors were isolated to that location.
866374_12_ITEM6_P6_S3	These errors, which primarily understated cost of sales, totaled $10.4 million, $8.0 million and $6.5 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively, and were corrected by the Company as an out-of-period adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM6_P6_S4	Management believes the impact of this item, to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and to prior fiscal years presented was not material.
866374_12_ITEM6_P6_S5	As a result of recording these adjustments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, net income for the year ended March 31, 2012 was reduced by $24.9 million ($0.03 per share).
866374_12_ITEM6_P6_S6	(9) One of the Company's customers in the concentrated solar photovoltaic market is experiencing significant financial and liquidity difficulties and as a result, the Company incurred $32.0 million of charges related to this customer.

866374_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	In addition, new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business.
866374_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	Accordingly, our future results may differ materially from historical results or from those discussed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
866374_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	Given these risks and uncertainties, the reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
866374_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a leading global provider of vertically-integrated advanced design, manufacturing and services to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") of a broad range of electronics products in the following markets: High Reliability Solutions (HRS), which is comprised of our medical, automotive, and defense and aerospace businesses; High Velocity Solutions (HVS), which includes our mobile/smart phone business, consumer electronics, including game consoles and printers, enterprise PC business and our ODM personal computing business which we exited in the third quarter of fiscal 2012; Industrial and Emerging Industries (IEI), which is comprised of our industrial, semiconductor capital equipment and clean technology businesses; and Integrated Network Solutions (INS), which includes our telecommunications infrastructure, data networking, connected home, and server and storage businesses.
866374_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Historically, our industry experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elected to outsource some or all of their design and manufacturing requirements.
866374_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	We have seen an increase in the penetration of the global OEM manufacturing requirements since the 2001 - 2002 technology downturn as more and more OEMs pursued the benefits of outsourcing rather than internal manufacturing.
866374_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	In the second half of fiscal 2009, we experienced dramatically deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and demand for our customers' products slowed in all of the industries we serve.
866374_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	This global economic crisis, and related decline in demand for our customers' products, put pressure on certain of our OEM customers' cost structures and caused them to reduce their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing requirements.
866374_12_ITEM7_P3_S4	Beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2010, we began seeing some positive signs that demand for our OEM customers' end products was improving, and this trend continued through the end of our 2012 fiscal year.
866374_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	We use a portfolio management approach to manage our extensive service offering.
866374_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	As our OEM customers change in the way they go to market, we reorganize and rebalance our business portfolio in order to align with our customers and to optimize our operating results.
866374_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	As part of our portfolio management strategy, we expect to decrease the percentage of our revenue from our HVS businesses, which has lower margins, and increase the percentage of our revenue from our more complex and higher margin non-HVS businesses.
866374_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	Our target is to achieve a mix whereby approximately 70% of our revenue is derived from our non-HVS businesses and 30% of our revenue is derived from our HVS businesses.
866374_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	We believe this is an optimal portfolio position for the Company which will result in expanded margins, though resulting in lower overall revenue in the near term as we rebalance.
866374_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	and have accelerated the reduction in our HVS market, a trend that we expect to continue in to fiscal 2013.
866374_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	We also expect to fully reposition assets and capacity in the HVS business in our non-HVS businesses.
866374_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	The objective of our operating model is to allow us to redeploy and reposition our assets and resources across all the markets we serve.
866374_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	In May 2011, due to negative operating margins and performance metrics on certain of our larger customer contracts, we announced that we would be phasing out of our ODM personal computing (PC) business.
866374_12_ITEM7_P5_S4	By the end of fiscal year 2012 we ceased all ODM PC manufacturing operations and certain design activities of ODM related businesses.
866374_12_ITEM7_P5_S5	These businesses generated $1.6 billion in sales and sustained operating losses of approximately $113.1 million in fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P5_S6	We have redeployed the majority of the associated manufacturing and design assets into other parts of our business, which will benefit our future cash flows through reduced capital expenditure requirements.
866374_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Additionally, as a result of the challenges faced by our camera modules business, this business has been performing at below optimal levels for the past several years.
866374_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	On March 2, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Tessera Technologies, Inc., and DigitalOptics Corporation (DOC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tessera Technologies, in which DOC will acquire certain assets of Flextronics' Vista Point Technologies camera module business, including intellectual property and the China-based manufacturing operations.
866374_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 subject to certain closing conditions.
866374_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	The results of operations and financial position of the divested camera modules business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented, and include a $17.0 million charge in fiscal 2012 for the impairment of fixed assets to be disposed in the transaction based on the expected proceeds from the sale.
866374_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	With respect to our remaining components businesses, our manufacturing efficiencies and production yields continued to improve and during fiscal year 2012 our component product solution services made progress reducing their aggregate operating losses.
866374_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	We are encouraged by the increased demand for these product solutions and the successful achievement of acceptance in the market, and we remain intensely focused on further improving our manufacturing efficiencies and thus our future margins and profitability.
866374_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	We are one of the world's largest manufacturing service providers, with revenues of $29.4 billion in fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	We design, build, ship, and service electronics products for our customers through a network of facilities in over 30 countries across four continents.
866374_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	We have established an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world's major electronics markets (Asia, the Americas and Europe) in order to serve the growing outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	As of March 31, 2012, our total manufacturing capacity was approximately 26.7 million square feet.
866374_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	In fiscal 2012, our net sales in Asia, the Americas and Europe represented approximately 52%, 29% and 19%, respectively, of our total net sales, based on the location of the manufacturing site.
866374_12_ITEM7_P9_S5	The following tables set forth net sales and net property and equipment, by country, based on the location of our manufacturing sites:
866374_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	We believe that the combination of our extensive design and engineering services, significant scale and global presence, vertically-integrated end-to-end services, advanced supply chain management, industrial campuses in low-cost geographic areas and operational track record provide us with a competitive advantage in the market for designing, manufacturing and servicing electronics products for leading multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Through these services and facilities, we offer our OEM customers the ability to simplify their global product development, manufacturing process, and after sales services, and enable them to achieve meaningful time to market and cost savings.
866374_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including the following:
866374_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	changes in the macroeconomic environment and related changes in consumer demand; the mix of the manufacturing services we are providing, the number and size of new manufacturing programs, the degree to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity, seasonal demand, shortages of components and other factors; the effects on our business when our customers are not successful in marketing their products, or when their products do not gain widespread commercial acceptance; our increased components offerings which have required that we make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products; our ability to achieve commercially viable production yields and to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our OEM customers; the effects on our business due to our customers' products having short product life cycles; our customers' ability to cancel or delay orders or change production quantities; our customers' decision to choose internal manufacturing instead of outsourcing for their product requirements; our exposure to financially troubled customers; and integration of acquired businesses and facilities.
866374_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Net revenues for fiscal 2012 increased 3.2% or $0.9 billion to $29.4 billion as we grew in all the major markets we serve except for HVS, which was impacted by decreased sales of mobile handsets to one of our significant customers as we rebalanced our portfolio and our planned exit of its ODM PC business.
866374_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	However, we believe that we finished the year in a healthy financial and competitive position driven in part by the success in our diversified business model.
866374_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	The overall improvement in the macroeconomic environment during fiscal 2012 and the success in booking new product orders for our array of key customers led to increased demand for our OEM customers' end products.
866374_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	majority of our sales growth during the year was organic, as the impact from acquisitions was minimal.
866374_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our fiscal 2012 gross profit totaled $1.5 billion, representing a decrease of $68.6 million, or 4.3%, compared to fiscal 2011 driven primarily by an increase in sales of low margin products in the ODM personal computing business that we exited in the third quarter of fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	Our income from continuing operations of $510.6 million was lower than the $606.3 million realized in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting the operating losses sustained from the ODM personal computing business and the $32.0 million we recognized for a financially distressed customer as discussed further below.
866374_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company identified certain accounting errors in the statutory to US GAAP adjustments at one of its foreign sites that originated in prior interim and annual periods.
866374_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Management conducted additional procedures and concluded that these errors were isolated to that location.
866374_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	These errors, which primarily understated cost of sales, totaled $0.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2012 and $10.4 million and $8.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, and were corrected by the Company as an out-of-period adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	This fourth quarter adjustment was partially offset by the correction of an error identified in the fourth quarter fiscal 2012 amounting to $4.2 million related to the provisions for income taxes in the prior fiscal 2012 interim periods.
866374_12_ITEM7_P15_S4	Management believes the impact of these items, both individually and in the aggregate, to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and to prior fiscal and interim periods presented was not material.
866374_12_ITEM7_P15_S5	As a result of recording these adjustments in the fourth quarter, net income for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2012 were reduced by $21.5 million ($0.03 per share) and $24.9 million ($0.03 per share), respectively.
866374_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Subsequent to March 31, 2012, the Company became aware that one of its customers in the concentrated solar photovoltaic market was experiencing significant financial and liquidity difficulties.
866374_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Company has been in good faith negotiations with the customer and its primary stakeholders on various out-of-court restructuring alternatives.
866374_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	Based on an evaluation of this customer's specific circumstances through May 25, 2012, including but not limited to, its financing alternatives, business prospects, proposed restructuring alternatives and the possibility of insolvency, the Company determined that its best estimate was that all accounts receivable and inventory related to this customer were unrecoverable and recorded a charge of $32.0 million as of March 31, 2012 related to this customer.
866374_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	Of this charge, the Company classified $4.0 million in cost of sales related to the write-down of inventory and $28.0 million as selling, general and administrative expenses for provisions for doubtful accounts.
866374_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	Based on all information available through March 31, 2012, the Company believed that payment of receivables was reasonably assured at the time of shipment, and accordingly, the Company recorded revenues on sales to the customer.
866374_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Cash provided by operations decreased approximately $53.0 million to $804.3 million for fiscal year 2012 compared with $857.3 million for fiscal year 2011.
866374_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Working capital increased $250.6 million in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts payable and to a lesser extent from an increase in accounts receivable.
866374_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	Our average net working capital, defined as accounts receivable plus the deferred purchase price receivable from our asset-backed securitization programs plus inventory less accounts payable, as a percentage of annual sales was approximately 6.2%, 4.5% and 5.0% for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	The increase in the percentage for the year ended March 31, 2012 is primarily attributable to the change in our overall portfolio as our mix of business shifted to a lesser percentage of HVS, which historically carries significantly higher inventory turns and customers with contractually faster payment terms.
866374_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	Our free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment, was $416.3 million for fiscal 2012 compared to $463.5 million for fiscal 2011, primarily due to lesser cash flows from operations partially off-set by lower capital expenditures as we continue to reposition assets from the ODM personal computing business we exited in the December quarter.
866374_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $522.2 million during fiscal 2012 and included repurchases of approximately 81.7 million ordinary shares at an aggregate purchase price of $509.8 million.
866374_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Fiscal 2012 was a transformational year and one in which we took further steps to achieve a more diversified portfolio, as evidenced by our exit of the ODM PC business.
866374_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	We continue our focus on diversifying our product portfolio from the high volume low margin HVS market to other markets with a view to improving profitability and we expect these actions to take further effect over the course of fiscal 2013.
866374_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	We believe that this diversified portfolio provides our investors with a more stable and predictable portfolio with longer product lifecycles.
866374_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	We believe that the long-term, future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities, design and engineering services and after-market services are and will remain strong.
866374_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
866374_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
866374_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
866374_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	We recognize manufacturing revenue when we ship goods or the goods are received by our customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured.
866374_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Generally, there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services.
866374_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	If such requirements or obligations exist, then we recognize the related revenues at the time when such requirements are completed and the obligations are fulfilled.
866374_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	We make provisions for estimated sales returns and other adjustments at the time revenue is recognized based upon contractual terms and an analysis of historical returns.
866374_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	These provisions were not material to our consolidated financial statements for the 2012, 2011 and 2010 fiscal years.
866374_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	We provide a comprehensive suite of services for our customers that range from contract design services to manufacturing and logistics to repair services.
866374_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	We recognize service revenue when the services have been performed, and the related costs are expensed as incurred.
866374_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	Our net sales for services were less than 10% of our total sales during the 2012, 2011 and 2010 fiscal years, and accordingly, are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	We have an established customer credit policy through which we manage customer credit exposures through credit evaluations, credit limit setting, monitoring, and enforcement of credit limits for new and existing customers.
866374_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and make provisions for doubtful accounts based on the outcome of those credit evaluations.
866374_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances, current economic trends, and the age of past due receivables.
866374_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	To the extent we identify exposures as a result of credit or customer evaluations, we also review other customer related exposures, including but not limited to inventory and related contractual obligations.
866374_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Subsequent to March 31, 2012, the Company became aware that one of its customers in the concentrated solar photovoltaic market was experiencing significant financial and liquidity difficulties.
866374_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Company recognized a charge of $32 million in relation to write-off of bad debt and write-down of inventory in connection with this distressed customer.
866374_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	Refer to the overview section for further detail.
866374_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	We recognize restructuring charges related to our plans to close or consolidate duplicate manufacturing and administrative facilities.
866374_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	In connection with these activities, we recognize restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other restructuring-related costs.
866374_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	The recognition of these restructuring charges require that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	To the extent our actual results in exiting these facilities differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Refer to note 12, "Restructuring Charges," of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	We review property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
866374_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of these long-lived assets exceeds their fair value.
866374_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Recoverability of property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets are measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
866374_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets exceeds fair value.
866374_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value.
866374_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short-term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand.
866374_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	We purchase our inventory based on forecasted demand, and we estimate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand, and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers.
866374_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	If actual market conditions or our customers' product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional provisions may be required.
866374_12_ITEM7_P32_S4	In addition, unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers and/or changes in economic conditions may require additional write downs for inventories due to our customers' inability to fulfill their contractual obligations with regard to inventory procured to fulfill customer demand.
866374_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities which will result in deductible amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards.
866374_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	Based on estimates, the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize these deferred income tax assets.
866374_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	international tax laws and other factors.
866374_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets previously recognized, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.
866374_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	Refer to note 11 "Income Taxes" of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our tax position.
866374_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales.
866374_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The data below, and discussion that follows, represents our results from operations.
866374_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	On March 2, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain assets of its Vista Point Technologies camera module business.
866374_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 subject to certain closing conditions.
866374_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	The camera modules business represents a separate asset group and the divestiture qualifies as discontinued operations, and accordingly, the Company has reported the results of operations and financial position of this business in discontinued operations within the statements of operations and the balance sheets for all periods presented.
866374_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2012 totaled $29.4 billion, representing an increase of $0.9 billion, or 3.2%, from $28.5 billion during fiscal year 2011.
866374_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	(ii) $0.5 billion or 28.5% in the HRS market, and (iii) $0.1 billion or 1.7% in the IEI market.
866374_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	The increase in sales for our INS market were driven by new program wins with existing customers with products in enterprise data networking and telecommunications infrastructure markets, offset by declining demand from certain customer programs in the server market that were reducing due to the end of the product life cycles or which transitioned to another supplier.
866374_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	The increase in sales for our HRS market were driven primarily from new wins and programs with our larger customers in the automotive, medical equipment and drug delivery markets.
866374_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	The increase in sales for our IEI market was due to new customer wins and new programs with existing customers across this business group primarily with customers serving the clean tech markets offset by reduced demand from our customers serving the capital equipment markets.
866374_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	The increase in net sales for these markets were offset by a $0.5 billion or 4.2% decrease in sales in the HVS market due to a decrease in sales of mobile handsets to one of our significant customers as we rebalance our portfolio, partially offset by an increase in sales through the first nine months of fiscal 2012 to another significant customer in the ODM personal computing business which we exited in the third quarter of fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P40_S4	Net sales increased across all of the geographical regions we serve, consisting of increases of $0.8 billion in Asia, $0.1 billion in the Americas and an insignificant increase in Europe.
866374_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2011 totaled $28.5 billion, representing an increase of $4.5 billion, or 18.7%, from $24.0 billion during fiscal year 2010, primarily due to an improved macroeconomic environment that led to increased demand for our OEM customers ends products.
866374_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Sales during fiscal year 2011 increased across all of the markets we serve, consisting of increases of: (i) $2.4 billion or 24.3% in the HVS market, (ii) $0.9 billion or 30.1% in the IEI market, (iii) $0.7 billion or 7.2% in the INS market and (iv) $0.5 billion or 34.8% in the HRS market.
866374_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	These increases were driven by increased sales from almost all of our major customers combined with new customer wins and new program wins with existing customers.
866374_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	Net sales increased across all of the geographical regions we serve, consisting of increases of $3.1 billion in Asia, $0.8 billion in Europe and $0.6 billion in the Americas.
866374_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table sets forth net sales by market:
866374_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our ten largest customers during fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 accounted for approximately 55%, 52% and 47% of net sales, respectively, with Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Research In Motion (RIM) each accounting for greater than 10% of our net sales during fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	During fiscal year 2011 RIM accounted for greater than 10% of net sales and during fiscal year 2010 HP accounted for greater than 10% of net sales.
866374_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Gross profit is affected by a number of factors, including the number and size of new manufacturing programs, product mix, component costs and availability, product life cycles, unit volumes, pricing, competition, new product introductions, capacity utilization and the expansion and consolidation of manufacturing facilities.
866374_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	In the cases of new programs, profitability normally lags revenue growth due to product start-up costs, lower manufacturing program volumes in the start-up phase, operational inefficiencies, and under-absorbed overhead.
866374_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Gross margin often improves over time as manufacturing program volumes increase, as our utilization rates and overhead absorption improves, and as we increase the level of vertically-integrated manufacturing services content.
866374_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	As a result of these various factors, our gross margin varies from period to period.
866374_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Gross profit during fiscal year 2012 decreased $68.6 million to $1.5 billion from $1.6 billion during fiscal year 2011.
866374_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	Gross margin decreased to 5.2% of net sales in fiscal year 2012 as compared with 5.6% of net sales in fiscal 2011.
866374_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	The decreases in gross profit and gross margin were primarily attributable to a higher mix of low-margin products principally associated with the increase in sales of products in the ODM personal computing business during the first nine months of fiscal 2012, which are included in the HVS market which we exited in the third quarter of fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	These businesses sustained gross losses of approximately $38.2 million in fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	Fiscal 2012 cost of sales also includes the impact of adjustments made to correct certain accounting errors identified and recorded as out of period adjustments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 as discussed in the Overview section.
866374_12_ITEM7_P46_S5	These out-of period adjustments amounted to approximately $23.9 million and resulted in increased cost of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P46_S6	In addition, gross margins were negatively impacted by unfavorable manufacturing costs associated with the exit of our ODM related businesses and costs incurred for right-sizing activities at various locations.
866374_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Gross profit during fiscal year 2011 increased $374.4 million to $1.6 billion from $1.2 billion during fiscal year 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Gross margin increased to 5.6% of net sales in fiscal year 2011 as compared with 5.0% of net sales in fiscal 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	The 60 basis point year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to increased net sales resulting in better utilization of our capacity and absorption of our fixed costs, and in part, due to cost reduction and operational efficiency benefits related to prior years' restructuring activities.
866374_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	We did not incur restructuring charges during fiscal year 2011 compared to restructuring costs of $92.4 million in fiscal 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	We have essentially completed all activities associated with previously announced plans and the remaining restructuring accrual as at March 31, 2012 was not significant.
866374_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Additionally, there were no changes to any of the previously announced plans during fiscal 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	While we incur severance, asset impairment charges and other facilities charges as a result of changes in our customer mix on an ongoing basis, such individual actions were not considered material to be separately disclosed as restructuring charges, and are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.
866374_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	The amount of accrued liabilities related to these actions at March 31, 2012 was not significant.
866374_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	We recognized restructuring charges of approximately $107.5 million during fiscal year 2010 as part of our restructuring plans previously announced in March 2009 in order to rationalize our global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure in response to weakened macroeconomic conditions.
866374_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	The costs associated with these restructuring activities included employee severance, costs related to owned and leased facilities and equipment that is no longer in use and is to be disposed of, and other costs associated with the exit of certain contractual arrangements due to facility closures.
866374_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	We classified approximately $92.4 million of these charges as cost of sales and approximately $15.1 million of these charges as selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal year 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	The charges recognized by reportable geographic region amounted to $45.1 million, $37.3 million and $25.1 million for Asia, Europe and the Americas, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM7_P49_S4	Approximately $43.1 million of these restructuring charges were non-cash.
866374_12_ITEM7_P49_S5	As of March 31, 2012, accrued severance and facility closure costs related to restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2010 and prior were approximately $12.7 million, of which $9.2 million was classified as current.
866374_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Refer to note 12, "Restructuring Charges," of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG A, totaled $880.6 million or 3.0% of net sales, during fiscal year 2012, compared to $804.9 million, or 2.8% of net sales, during fiscal year 2011.
866374_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	The increases in SG A in dollars and as a percentage of net sales were primarily attributable to the $28.0 million in bad debt expense we recognized in connection with the financial distress currently experienced by one of our customers, and severance costs and other asset impairment costs associated with the exit of our ODM related businesses during the December quarter.
866374_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG A, totaled $804.9 million or 2.8% of net sales, during fiscal year 2011, compared to $755.1 million, or 3.1% of net sales, during fiscal year 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	The increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of increased compensation expense due to increased headcount in various corporate support activities, such as information technology and supply chain management, necessary to support the growth of our operations.
866374_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Further, we realized increased costs associated with research, development and engineering activities as we continued to make investments to meet the needs of our customers.
866374_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	The overall decrease in SG A as a percentage of sales during fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to our significant increase in sales as we were able to leverage our SG A percentage down.
866374_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal year 2012 decreased by $15.0 million to $55.9 million from $70.9 million in fiscal year 2011.
866374_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	The reduction in expense was primarily due to certain assets becoming fully amortized and the use of the accelerated method of amortization for certain customer related intangibles, which results in decreasing expense over time.
866374_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal year 2011 decreased by $18.7 million to $70.9 million from $89.6 million in fiscal year 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	The reduction in expense was primarily due to certain assets becoming fully amortized and the use of the accelerated method of amortization for certain customer related intangibles, which results in decreasing expense over time, and was partially offset by purchase accounting adjustments.
866374_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	During fiscal 2012, the Company recognized a net gain of $20.0 million, in connection with the sale of certain international entities.
866374_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	During fiscal 2011, we recognized charges totaling $6.3 million, consisting of a $13.2 million loss associated with the early redemption of our 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes, and an $11.7 million loss in connection with the divestiture of certain international entities, offset by a gain of $18.6 million associated with the sale of an equity investment that was previously fully impaired.
866374_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	During fiscal 2010, we sold our entire interest in one of our non-majority owned investments and related note receivable for cash of approximately $252.5 million, and recognized an impairment charge associated with this sale amounting to $107.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	We also recognized charges totaling approximately $92.0 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 associated with the other-than-temporary impairment of our notes receivable from one affiliate and an equity investment in another affiliate.
866374_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	Deterioration in the business prospects, cash flow expectations, and increased liability concerns of the affiliate and the equity investment resulted in the impairment of the carrying value to the estimated recoverable value.
866374_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Interest and other expense, net was $36.0 million during fiscal 2012, compared to $75.4 million during fiscal 2011, a decrease of $39.4 million.
866374_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The decrease in net expense was primarily due to a $39.2 million reduction in net interest expense principally from the expiration of interest rate swaps in January 2011, which had fixed rates greater than the floating rates underlying our borrowing arrangements and to a lesser extent to the refinancing of $542.1 million of certain subordinated notes during fiscal 2011 with our lower rate revolving credit facility and Asia term loans.
866374_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	Gains on foreign exchange transactions increased $6.5 million during fiscal year 2012 as we continue to benefit from certain cross-border foreign currency transactions and the revaluation of RMB denominated net asset positions for our U.S. functional currency sites based in China.
866374_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	There can be no assurance that further gains from cross-border foreign exchange settlements in China will be available.
866374_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Interest and other expense, net was $75.4 million during fiscal 2011, compared to $155.7 million during fiscal 2010, a decrease of $80.3 million.
866374_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	The decrease in expense was the result of reduced debt levels as we redeemed $542.1 million of certain subordinated notes during the fiscal year.
866374_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	Further reduction in interest expense was due to lower interest rates as a result of $847.0 million in fixed rate debt.
866374_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	This decrease in interest expense was partially offset by interest expense on $160.0 million borrowed under our revolving lines of credit and $379.0 million borrowed under our Asia term loans.
866374_12_ITEM7_P59_S4	In addition, we recognized approximately $9.2 million of income during fiscal 2011 from foreign exchange gains.
866374_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates.
866374_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	The consolidated effective tax rates were 9.6%, 3.5% and 332.7% for the fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	The effective rate varies from the Singapore statutory rate of 17.0% as a result of recognition of earnings in different jurisdictions, operating loss carry forwards, income tax credits, previously established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, liabilities for uncertain tax positions, as well as because of the effect of certain tax holidays and incentives granted to our subsidiaries primarily in China, Malaysia, Israel, and Singapore.
866374_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	We generate most of our revenues and profits from operations outside of Singapore.
866374_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 varies from the effective rates for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 primarily as a result of changes in valuation allowances and liabilities for uncertain tax positions which are recorded on a discrete, quarterly basis.
866374_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	See note 11, "Income Taxes," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion.
866374_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Consistent with our strategy to evaluate the strategic and financial contributions of each of our operations and to focus on the primary growth objectives in the Company's core vertically-integrated manufacturing business activities, on March 2, 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement with Tessera Technologies, Inc., and DigitalOptics Corporation (DOC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tessera Technologies.
866374_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 subject to certain closing conditions.
866374_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	The divestiture of the camera modules business qualifies as a discontinued operation, and accordingly, we have reported the results of operations and financial position of this business in discontinued operations within the statements of operations and the balance sheets for all periods presented.
866374_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	The results from discontinued operations were as follows:
866374_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Net sales in fiscal 2012 decreased as we decelerated operations while evaluating strategic alternatives for the business and due to the end of certain product life cycles.
866374_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	The increase in net loss during fiscal 2012 is primarily attributable to a $17.0 million charge for impairment of fixed assets that will be sold in the transaction based on expected proceeds from the sale.
866374_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	The impairment charge is included in cost of sales.
866374_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Net sales in fiscal 2011 increased primarily due to an increase in demand for camera modules sub-assemblies from one of our more significant customers.
866374_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	The sudden and significant increase in volume resulted in manufacturing inefficiencies and poor production yields resulting in a $1.0 million gross loss during fiscal year 2011, which further translated into a $3.7 million increase in net losses primarily due to the fixed nature of certain SG A expenses that remained consistent with prior year, as compared with fiscal year 2010 after the benefit from income taxes.
866374_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	As of March 31, 2012, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion and bank and other borrowings of $2.2 billion.
866374_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, under which we had $140.0 million in borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2012, which is included in the $2.2 billion of borrowings above.
866374_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world.
866374_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	As of March 31, 2012, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries outside of Singapore.
866374_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	Although substantially all of the amounts held outside of Singapore could be repatriated, under current laws, a significant amount could be subject to income tax withholdings.
866374_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	We provide for tax liabilities on these amounts for financial statement purposes, except for certain of our foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Singapore (approximately $570.0 million as of March 31, 2012).
866374_12_ITEM7_P72_S4	Repatriation could result in an additional income tax payment, however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of Singapore and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our operations.
866374_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of Singapore and we would meet our liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both.
866374_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Cash provided by operating activities was $804.3 million during fiscal year 2012, which resulted primarily from $488.8 million of net income for the period and $539.1 million of non-cash earnings adjustment items such as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation expense.
866374_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	Offsetting these cash generating activities was $250.7 million of increased working capital.
866374_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	Our working capital accounts increased primarily due to a decrease of $750.2 million in accounts payable and a $97.9 million increase in accounts receivable, which was partially offset by a decrease in inventory of $301.1 million principally due to the deceleration of sales in our HVS market, and an increase in deferred revenues of $260.0 million.
866374_12_ITEM7_P74_S3	The decrease in accounts payable is principally related to the decrease in inventory and timing of supplier payments.
866374_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2012 was $481.4 million.
866374_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	This resulted primarily from $388.0 million in capital expenditures for equipment, net of proceeds on sales, and $92.3 million paid for three acquisitions completed during the year together with contingent consideration and deferred purchase price payments related to prior period acquisitions.
866374_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $522.2 million during fiscal year 2012, which was primarily attributable to the repurchase of approximately 81.7 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $509.8 million.
866374_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	During fiscal year 2012 we also repaid $20.0 million of debt outstanding on the Company's $2.0 billion revolving credit facility.
866374_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	As discussed further below, on October 19, 2011, the Company entered into a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility, which replaced the Company's $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, and refinanced one tranche of the Company's $1.7 billion Term Loan Agreement dated October 1, 2007.
866374_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	We paid $9.4 million of debt issuance costs associated with this new facility, which are reflected as financing outflows and will be amortized as a component of interest expense through October 2016.
866374_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Cash provided by operating activities was $857.3 million during fiscal year 2011, which resulted primarily from $596.2 million of net income for the period and $475.7 million of non-cash earnings adjustment items such as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, and stock-based compensation expense.
866374_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	Offsetting these cash generating activities was $221.5 million of increased working capital.
866374_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	Our working capital accounts increased primarily due to an increase of $664.7 million in inventories as a result of our increased production and anticipated growth, and an increase of $390.4 million in other current assets primarily attributable to $324.6 million in our deferred purchase price receivable associated with our receivables sales, which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $609.9 million and other current liabilities of $155.2 million, primarily driven by the timing of purchases and cash payments.
866374_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2011 was $413.2 million.
866374_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	This resulted primarily from $393.9 million in capital expenditures for equipment, net of proceeds on sales, and $17.0 million, net of cash acquired, for contingent consideration and deferred purchase price payments related to four acquisitions, and payments related to two completed acquisitions.
866374_12_ITEM7_P79_S2	Cash used was partially offset by proceeds related to the sale of an equity investment for $18.6 million.
866374_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $641.7 million during fiscal year 2011.
866374_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	On each of May 26, 2010, August 12, 2010 and March 23, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million, for a combined total of $600.0 million, of our outstanding shares.
866374_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	During the 2011 fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 65.4 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of $400.4 million, including accrued expenses.
866374_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	principal amount of the 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes at par plus accrued interest.
866374_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	In December 2010, we paid approximately $308.5 million to redeem the aggregate principal balance and redemption premium of our 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes ("6.25% Notes") plus accrued interest.
866374_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	In addition, we made repayments of approximately $217.1 million related to our Global Asset-Backed Securitization program effective with the adoption of new accounting standards on April 1, 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	The cash used in financing activities was partially offset by $379.0 million of additional borrowings under new Asia term loan agreements and $160.0 million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit.
866374_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	During September 2010, we entered into two new three-year term loan agreements with certain financial institutions based in Asia and borrowed $180.0 million in the aggregate.
866374_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	During February 2011, we entered into a new three-year term loan agreement with a financial institution based in Asia and borrowed $200.0 million in the aggregate.
866374_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Cash provided by operating activities was $798.9 million during fiscal year 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	This resulted primarily from $18.6 million of net income for the period before adjustments to include approximately $736.4 million of non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, non-cash interest income, and stock-based compensation expense.
866374_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	Our working capital accounts increased $169.5 million on a net basis, primarily as a result of increased business volume as both accounts receivable and accounts payable increased.
866374_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	The reduction in other current and noncurrent liabilities was primarily due to lower continued payout of prior obligations and accrued obligations related to acquisitions, restructuring charges and financing charges.
866374_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	Cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2010 was $7.8 million.
866374_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	This resulted primarily from proceeds related to the sale of an equity investment and note receivable for $259.8 million, net of closing costs, and was partially offset by approximately $176.5 million in capital expenditures for equipment, net of proceeds on sales and $75.9 million of deferred purchase price payments related to certain historical acquisitions and for three acquisitions completed during the fiscal year 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $713.3 million during fiscal year 2010.
866374_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	During June 2009, we used $203.2 million to repurchase an aggregate principal amount of $99.8 million of our 6.5% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 ("6.5% Notes") and an aggregate principal amount of $99.9 million of the 6.25% Notes due 2014 in a cash tender offer.
866374_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	On July 31, 2009, we paid $195.0 million to redeem the 0% Convertible Junior Subordinated Notes upon their maturity.
866374_12_ITEM7_P85_S3	On March 19, 2010, we used $306.3 million to redeem all of the remaining principle balance of $299.8 million of the 6.5% Notes.
866374_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions, repurchase company shares and for certain other activities.
866374_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	Our free cash flow, which is calculated as cash provided by operations less net purchases of property and equipment, was $416.3 million, $463.5 million and $622.5 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Days in trade accounts receivable was calculated as the average accounts receivable for the current and prior quarter, excluding the reduction in accounts receivable resulting from non-cash accounts receivable sales, divided by annualized sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, days in trade accounts receivable increased by 3 days to 45 days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 primarily as a result of the decline in sales in the HVS market that contained lower payment terms.
866374_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	Non-cash accounts receivable sales or deferred purchase price receivables included in trade receivables were $514.9 million, $460.0 million and $135.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM7_P87_S3	Deferred purchase price receivables were recorded in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
866374_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	Days in inventory was calculated as the average inventory for the current and prior quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, days in inventory increased 2 days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 directly due to a decrease in inventory turns.
866374_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	Our inventory turns were negatively impacted by the decline in sales in the HVS market which carry significantly higher inventory turns than our corporate average inventory turns.
866374_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	Days in accounts payable was calculated as the average accounts payable for the current and prior quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, days in accounts payable decreased 3 days to 70 days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to the reduction of inventory in our fourth quarter and timing of supplier payments.
866374_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our cash conversion cycle was calculated as days in trade receivables plus days in inventory, minus days in accounts payable and is a measure of how efficient we are at managing our working capital.
866374_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, our cash conversion cycle increased 8 days to 27 days as compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 due to the factors affecting each of the components in the calculation discussed above.
866374_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets.
866374_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world.
866374_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances.
866374_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout the global organization.
866374_12_ITEM7_P92_S3	We believe that our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months.
866374_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	Future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, the timing of capital expenditures for new equipment, the extent to which we utilize operating leases for new facilities and equipment, and the levels of shipments and changes in the volumes of customer orders.
866374_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	Historically, we have funded operations from cash and cash equivalents generated from operations, proceeds from public offerings of equity and debt securities, bank debt and lease financings.
866374_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	sell designated pools of trade receivables under asset-backed securitization ("ABS") programs and sell certain trade receivables, which are in addition to the trade receivables sold in connection with these securitization agreements.
866374_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	During fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 we received approximately $4.7 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively from sales of receivables under our ABS programs, and $2.0 billion, $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively from other sales of receivables.
866374_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, we sold receivables for cash totaling $667.3 million and $654.7 million, respectively, under all our accounts receivable sales programs, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets.
866374_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	We anticipate that we will enter into debt and equity financings, sales of accounts receivable and lease transactions to fund acquisitions and anticipated growth.
866374_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	The sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current shareholders.
866374_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	Further, we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations and could increase debt service obligations.
866374_12_ITEM7_P97_S2	This increased indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, potentially affect our credit ratings, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_12_ITEM7_P97_S3	Any downgrades in credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow as a result of more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_12_ITEM7_P97_S4	We continue to asses our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase ordinary shares.
866374_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	On July 22, 2011, our shareholders approved the repurchase of up to 10% of our ordinary shares outstanding on the date of our 2011 Extraordinary General Meeting, which repurchases are subject to Board of Directors approval.
866374_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	Our Board of Directors approved share repurchase plans in July 2011 and December 2011, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase approximately 73 million shares until our next Extraordinary General Meeting to be held during 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	During the 2012 fiscal year, the Company repurchased approximately 81.7 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $509.8 million.
866374_12_ITEM7_P98_S3	Of the 81.7 million shares, approximately 29.0 million shares were repurchased under the prior shareholder purchase mandate.
866374_12_ITEM7_P98_S4	As of March 31, 2012, approximately 20.4 million shares were available to be repurchased under the plans.
866374_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	On October 19, 2011, the Company entered into a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility ("New Credit Facility") consisting of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility ("New Revolving Credit Facility") and a $500 million term loan ("New Term Loan"), which expires in October 2016.
866374_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	The New Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Company's previous $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which was due to mature in May 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	The New Term Loan refinanced one tranche of the Company's $1.7 billion Term Loan dated October 1, 2007.
866374_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	As of March 31, 2012, there was $140.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility.
866374_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	The New Credit Facility requires that we maintain a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined.
866374_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	As of March 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the covenants under the credit facility.
866374_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	We and certain of our subsidiaries also have various uncommitted revolving credit facilities, lines of credit and other loans in the amount of $290.6 million in the aggregate under which there were approximately $4.6 million of borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	We have approximately $1.7 billion of borrowings outstanding under our term loan facilities as of March 31, 2012, including the New Term Loan discussed above.
866374_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	Of these amounts, approximately $1.2 billion matures in October 2014, and the remainder matures in October 2016.
866374_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	The portion of the term loan facility that matures in October 2014 amortizes in quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1% per annum.
866374_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	installments of $6.3 million through September 2013 and $9.4 million per quarter thereafter.
866374_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	Both of these term loan facilities require that we maintain a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, and as of March 31, 2012, we were in compliance with these covenants.
866374_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	We have approximately $377.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Asia term loans as of March 31, 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	These term loans mature in September 2013 and February 2014.
866374_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	Borrowings under the Asia term loans bear interest at LIBOR plus margins ranging between 2.15% and 2.30% and we paid non-refundable fees of $2.4 million at the inception of the loans.
866374_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	Refer to the discussion in note 6, "Bank Borrowings and Long-Term Debt" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of the Company's debt obligations.
866374_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	We have purchase obligations that arise in the normal course of business, primarily consisting of binding purchase orders for inventory related items and capital expenditures.
866374_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	Additionally, we have leased certain of our property and equipment under capital lease commitments, and certain of our facilities and equipment under operating lease commitments.
866374_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	Future payments due under our purchase obligations, debt including capital leases and related interest obligations and operating lease contracts are as follows:
866374_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	Interest on the $1.2 billion outstanding under our term loan facility that matures in October 2014 is based at our option on either (i) the base rate (the greater of the agent's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus a margin of 1.25%; or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%.
866374_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	Interest on the New Credit Facility, under which, as of March 31, 2012, we had $487.5 million outstanding under our New Term Loan and $140.0 million outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility is based at our option on, either at (i) LIBOR plus the applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranging between 1.25% and 2.25%, based on the Company's credit ratings or (ii) the base rate (the greatest of the agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin ranging between 0.25% and 1.25%, based on the Company's credit rating.
866374_12_ITEM7_P108_S2	Interest on the $377.0 million outstanding under our Asia term loans accrues at LIBOR plus 2.15% to 2.30%.
866374_12_ITEM7_P108_S3	Finally, our variable rate debt also includes demand notes and certain variable lines of credit.
866374_12_ITEM7_P108_S4	These credit lines are located throughout the world and variable interest is generally based on a spread over that country's inter-bank offering rate.
866374_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	Interest expense in the table above is estimated based on LIBOR as of March 31, 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	We have excluded $166.4 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from the contractual obligations table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the periodic cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities.
866374_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	See note 11, "Income Taxes" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details.
866374_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements.
866374_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	We intend to use our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations to fund our existing and future contractual obligations.
866374_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	We sell designated pools of trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions under our ABS programs, and in addition to cash, we receive a deferred purchase price receivable for each pool of the receivables sold.
866374_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	Each of these deferred purchase price receivables serves as additional credit support to the financial institutions and is recorded at its estimated fair value.
866374_12_ITEM7_P112_S2	The fair value of our deferred purchase price receivable was approximately $514.9 million as of March 31, 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7_P112_S3	For further information see note 8 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	Refer to note 2, "Summary of Accounting Policies" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio, which consists of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from original dates of purchase.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to 20% of the issuer's or fund's total assets measured at the time of purchase or $10.0 million, whichever is greater.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We protect our invested principal by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities and by constantly positioning the portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P0_S5	The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Maturities of short-term investments are timed, whenever possible, to correspond with debt payments and capital investments.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	As of March 31, 2012, the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was $0.3 billion, comprised mainly of money market funds with an average return of 3.13%.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We had variable rate debt outstanding of approximately $2.2 billion as of March 31, 2012.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Variable rate debt obligations primarily consisted of borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facilities.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Interest on the $1.2 billion outstanding under our term loan facility that matures in October 2014 is based at our option on either (i) the base rate (the greater of the agent's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus a margin of 1.25%; or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Interest on the New Credit Facility, under which we had as of March 31, 2012 $487.5 million outstanding under our New Term Loan and $140.0 million outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility is based at our option on either (i) LIBOR plus the applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranging between 1.25% and 2.25%, based on the Company's credit ratings or (ii) the base rate (the greatest of the agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin ranging between 0.25% and 1.25%, based on the Company's credit rating.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Interest on the $377.0 million outstanding under our Asia term loans accrues at LIBOR plus 2.15% to 2.30%.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P3_S5	Finally, our variable rate debt also includes demand notes and certain variable lines of credit.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P3_S6	These credit lines are located throughout the world and variable interest is generally based on a spread over that country's inter-bank offering rate.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our variable rate debt instruments create exposures for us related to interest rate risk.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Primarily due to the current low interest rates a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	As of March 31, 2012, the approximate fair value of our debt outstanding under our term loan facility that matures in October 2014 was 99.4%, of the face value of the debt obligation, and the fair value of debt outstanding under our New Term Loan was 99.0% of the face value of the debt obligation, based on broker trading prices.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Our Asia term loans are not traded publicly; however, as the pricing, maturity and other pertinent terms of these loans closely approximate those of the term loan facilities described above, we estimate the respective fair values would be approximately the same as the respective term loan facilities.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	We have established a foreign currency risk management policy to manage this risk.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P7_S2	To the extent possible, we manage our foreign currency exposure by evaluating and using non-financial techniques, such as currency of invoice, leading and lagging payments and receivables management.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P7_S3	In addition, we borrow in various foreign currencies and enter into short-term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities, mainly accounts receivable and accounts payable, and cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We endeavor to maintain a partial or fully hedged position for certain transaction exposures.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	These exposures are primarily, but not limited to, revenues, customer and vendor payments and inter-company balances in currencies other than the functional currency unit of the operating entity.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The credit risk of our foreign currency forward and swap contracts is minimized since all contracts are with large financial institutions and accordingly, fair value adjustments related to the credit risk of the counter-party financial institution were not material.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The gains and losses on forward and swap contracts generally offset the losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and transactions hedged.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The fair value of currency forward and swap contracts is reported on the balance sheet.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts as of March 31, 2012 amounted to $2.7 billion and the recorded fair values of the associated asset and/or liability were not material.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The majority of these foreign exchange contracts expire in less than three months and all expire within one year.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P10_S1	They will settle primarily in Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, China renminbi, Danish kroner, Euro, Hungarian forint, Israeli shekel, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, and U.S. dollar.
866374_12_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Based on our overall currency rate exposures as of March 31, 2012, including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and cash flows, a near-term 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar from its cross-functional rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Flextronics International Ltd.
866374_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Flextronics International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2012.
866374_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
866374_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
866374_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
866374_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
866374_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

866374_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	See note 12 for additional information regarding restructuring charges.
866374_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements, including rights of setoff associated with the entity's recognized financial assets and liabilities, on the entity's financial position.
866374_12_ITEM8_P71_S1	The new disclosures will enable financial statement users to compare balance sheets prepared under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are subject to different offsetting models.
866374_12_ITEM8_P71_S2	The disclosures will be limited to financial instruments (and derivatives) subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements.
866374_12_ITEM8_P71_S3	Similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase agreements, and global master securities lending agreements.
866374_12_ITEM8_P71_S4	Financial instruments and transactions that will be subject to the disclosure requirements may include derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing arrangements.
866374_12_ITEM8_P71_S5	An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
866374_12_ITEM8_P71_S6	The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2014.
866374_12_ITEM8_P71_S7	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
866374_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	In September 2011, the FASB revised guidance for testing goodwill for impairment.
866374_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step one of the goodwill impairment test.
866374_12_ITEM8_P72_S2	If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required.
866374_12_ITEM8_P72_S3	Otherwise, further testing would not be needed.
866374_12_ITEM8_P72_S4	The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
866374_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements.
866374_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	The new guidance removes the presentation options in ASC 220 and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements.
866374_12_ITEM8_P73_S2	For the Company, this new guidance is effective as of April 1, 2012.
866374_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	In May 2011, the FASB amended fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to achieve convergence with IFRS.
866374_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	The amended guidance modifies the measurement of fair value, clarifies verbiage, and changes disclosure or other requirements in US GAAP and IFRS.
866374_12_ITEM8_P74_S2	The guidance was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2012 and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders' equity.
866374_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure requirements for revenue recognition.
866374_12_ITEM8_P75_S1	These amendments modify the criteria for recognizing revenue in multiple element arrangements.
866374_12_ITEM8_P75_S2	The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements beginning April 1, 2011.
866374_12_ITEM8_P75_S3	The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
866374_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	During fiscal year 2012, the Company granted equity compensation awards under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan").
866374_12_ITEM8_P76_S1	As of March 31, 2012, the Company had approximately 51.7 million shares available for grants under the 2010 Plan.
866374_12_ITEM8_P76_S2	Options issued to employees under the 2010 Plan generally vest over four years and expire seven years from the date of grant.
866374_12_ITEM8_P76_S3	Options granted to non-employee directors expire five years from the date of grant.
866374_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	The exercise price of options granted to employees is determined by the Company's Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and may not be less than the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant.
866374_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company also grants share bonus awards under its equity compensation plan.
866374_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	Share bonus awards are rights to acquire a specified number of ordinary shares for no cash consideration in exchange for continued service with the Company.
866374_12_ITEM8_P78_S2	Share bonus awards generally vest in installments over a three to five year period and unvested share bonus awards are forfeited upon termination of employment.
866374_12_ITEM8_P78_S3	Vesting for certain share bonus awards is contingent upon both service and market conditions.
866374_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense:
866374_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	As required by the authoritative guidance for stock-based compensation, management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.
866374_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary termination behavior as well as an analysis of actual forfeitures.
866374_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	Total share-based compensation capitalized as part of inventory during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 was not material.
866374_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	As of March 31, 2012, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share options granted to employees under the Company's equity compensation plans was approximately $6.7 million, net of estimated forfeitures.
866374_12_ITEM8_P83_S1	This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.7 years and will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_12_ITEM8_P83_S2	As of March 31, 2012, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share bonus awards granted to employees was approximately $63.7 million, net of estimated forfeitures.
866374_12_ITEM8_P83_S3	This cost will be amortized generally on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.6 years and will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_12_ITEM8_P83_S4	Approximately $10.7 million of the unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, is related to share bonus awards granted to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting a certain market condition.
866374_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	Cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits (tax benefits related to the excess of proceeds from employee exercises of share options over the share-based compensation cost recognized for those options) are classified as financing cash flows.
866374_12_ITEM8_P84_S1	During fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not recognize any excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow.
866374_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share options granted using the Black-Scholes valuation method and a single option award approach.
866374_12_ITEM8_P85_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
866374_12_ITEM8_P85_S2	The fair market value of share bonus awards granted, other than those awards with a market condition, is the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant and is generally recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.
866374_12_ITEM8_P85_S3	For share bonus awards whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions, the fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation.
866374_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	Expected Term The Company's expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation method represents the period that the Company's share options are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share options, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its share options.
866374_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	Expected Volatility The Company's expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes valuation method is derived from a combination of implied volatility related to publicly traded options to purchase Flextronics ordinary shares and historical variability in the Company's periodic share price.
866374_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	Expected Dividend The Company has never paid dividends on its ordinary shares and currently does not intend to do so in the near term, and accordingly, the dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.
866374_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities issued with a term equivalent to the expected term of the option.
866374_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	The fair value of the Company's share options granted to employees for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, other than those granted in connection with the option exchange in fiscal year 2010 and those with market criteria discussed below, was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	Options granted during the 2012, 2011 and 2010 fiscal years had contractual lives of seven years.
866374_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	The following is a summary of option activity for the Company's equity compensation plans, ("Price" reflects the weighted-average exercise price):
866374_12_ITEM8_P93_S0	On August 11, 2009, the Company granted approximately 16.9 million replacement options with an exercise price of $5.57 and a contractual life of 7 years in exchange for approximately 27.9 million existing share options at an exchange ratio commensurate to the surrendered option's exercise price.
866374_12_ITEM8_P93_S1	The weighted average vesting period of the replacement options was approximately 1.6 years.
866374_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	The exchange was accounted for as a modification of the existing option awards tendered in the exchange.
866374_12_ITEM8_P94_S1	The resulting expense was insignificant and recognized primarily through fiscal year 2011.
866374_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised (calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying award and the price of the Company's ordinary shares determined as of the time of option exercise for options exercised in-the-money) under the Company's equity compensation plans was $17.1 million, $22.9 million and $10.3 million during fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	Cash received from option exercises was $23.1 million, $23.3 million and $6.0 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	The following table presents the composition of options outstanding and exercisable as of March 31, 2012:
866374_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	As of March 31, 2012, the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding, options vested and expected to vest (which includes adjustments for expected forfeitures), and options exercisable were $70.7 million, $70.2 million and $48.3 million, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM8_P98_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company's ordinary shares as of March 31, 2012 for the approximately 21.6 million options that were in-the-money at March 31, 2012.
866374_12_ITEM8_P98_S2	As of March 31, 2012, the weighted average remaining contractual life for options exercisable was 3.14 years.
866374_12_ITEM8_P99_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's share bonus award activity ("Price" reflects the weighted-average grant-date fair value):
866374_12_ITEM8_P100_S0	Of the 16.0 million unvested share bonus awards outstanding as of the year ended March 31, 2012, approximately 2.3 million represents the target amount of grants made to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting a certain market condition.
866374_12_ITEM8_P101_S0	Standard and Poor's ("S P") 500 Composite Index and will vest over a period of four years.
866374_12_ITEM8_P102_S0	Of the 2.3 million awards that were outstanding as of the year ended March 31, 2012, 1.3 million were granted in fiscal 2012 at an estimated average grant-date fair value of $7.78 per share and 1.0 million were granted in fiscal 2011 at an average grant-date fair value of $7.32 per share.
866374_12_ITEM8_P102_S1	The actual number of shares to be issued for the 2012 grants can range from zero to 1.9 million and zero to 1.5 million for the 2011 grants.
866374_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	The total intrinsic value of share bonus awards vested under the Company's equity compensation plans was $17.7 million, $19.6 million and $7.0 million during fiscal years 2012, 2011and 2010, respectively, based on the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date vested.
866374_12_ITEM8_P104_S0	Basic earnings per share for both continuing and discontinued operations exclude dilution and are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the applicable periods.
866374_12_ITEM8_P105_S0	Diluted earnings per share for both continuing and discontinued operations reflect the potential dilution from stock options, share bonus awards and convertible securities.
866374_12_ITEM8_P106_S0	The potential dilution from stock options exercisable into ordinary share equivalents and share bonus awards was computed using the treasury stock method based on the average fair market value of the Company's ordinary shares for the period.
866374_12_ITEM8_P106_S1	The potential dilution from the conversion spread (excess of conversion value over face value) of the Subordinated Notes convertible into ordinary share equivalents was calculated as the quotient of the conversion spread and the average fair market value of the Company's ordinary shares for the period.
866374_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following table reflects the basic weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding and diluted weighted-average ordinary share equivalents used to calculate basic and diluted income from continuing and discontinued operations per share:
866374_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	(1) Ordinary share equivalents of approximately 24.2 million, 25.5 million and 38.1 million shares to purchase stock options during fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share primarily because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market price of the Company's ordinary shares during the respective periods.
866374_12_ITEM8_P108_S1	(2) On August 2, 2010 the Company paid approximately $240.0 million to redeem its 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes upon maturity.
866374_12_ITEM8_P108_S2	The notes carried conversion provisions to issue shares to settle any conversion spread (excess of the conversion value over the conversion price) in stock.
866374_12_ITEM8_P108_S3	The conversion price was $15.525 per share (subject to certain adjustments).
866374_12_ITEM8_P108_S4	On the maturity date, the Company's stock price was less than the conversion spread, and therefore no shares were issued.
866374_12_ITEM8_P108_S5	For the year ended March 31, 2011, the conversion obligation was less than the principal portion of these notes and accordingly, no additional shares were included as ordinary share equivalents.
866374_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	The following table represents supplemental cash flow disclosures and non-cash investing and financing activities:
866374_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	For the year ended March 31, 2011, approximately $266.1 million of proceeds from bank borrowings and repayment of bank borrowings, related to certain short-term facilities, were previously reflected on a gross basis in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
866374_12_ITEM8_P110_S1	These amounts should have been reflected on a net basis in "Repayment of bank borrowings and long-term debt" and have been corrected in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows.
866374_12_ITEM8_P110_S2	The correction had no net impact on total cash used in financing activities.
866374_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	Bank borrowings and long-term debt are as follows:
866374_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	Maturities for the Company's long-term debt are as follows:

866374_12_ITEM8_P129_S0	During June 2009, the Company paid approximately $101.8 million to purchase an aggregate principal amount of $99.8 million of these Notes in a cash tender offer.
866374_12_ITEM8_P129_S1	The cash paid included $2.3 million in consent fees paid to holders of the Notes that were tendered but not purchased as well as to holders that consented but did not tender, which were capitalized and were being recognized as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the Notes until the redemption noted below.
866374_12_ITEM8_P129_S2	The Company recognized a $2.3 million loss during fiscal year 2010 associated with the partial extinguishment of the Notes, which included approximately $2.6 million for transaction costs and the write-down of related debt issuance costs.
866374_12_ITEM8_P129_S3	In conjunction with the tender offer, the Company obtained consents to certain amendments to the restricted payments covenants and certain related definitions in the indenture under which the Notes were issued.
866374_12_ITEM8_P129_S4	The amendments permitted the Company greater flexibility to purchase or make other payments in respect of its equity securities and debt that was subordinated to the Notes and to make certain other restricted payments under the indenture.
866374_12_ITEM8_P130_S0	On March 19, 2010, the Company paid approximately $306.3 million to redeem the remaining aggregate principal balance of $299.8 million of these notes at a redemption price of 102.167% of the principal amount.
866374_12_ITEM8_P130_S1	The Company recognized a loss associated with the early redemption of the notes of approximately $10.5 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, consisting of the redemption price premium of approximately $6.5 million, and approximately $4.0 million for transaction costs and the write-off of unamortized debt costs.
866374_12_ITEM8_P130_S2	The loss is recorded in other charges (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_12_ITEM8_P131_S0	During June 2009, the Company paid approximately $101.3 million to purchase an aggregate principal amount of $99.9 million of these Notes in a cash tender offer.
866374_12_ITEM8_P132_S0	component of interest expense over the remaining life of the Notes.
866374_12_ITEM8_P132_S1	The Company recognized a $2.3 million gain during fiscal year 2010 associated with the partial extinguishment of the Notes, net of approximately $2.7 million for transaction costs and the write-down of related debt issuance costs.
866374_12_ITEM8_P133_S0	During December 2010, the Company paid approximately $308.5 million to redeem the remaining aggregate principal balance of $302.2 million of these notes at a redemption price of 102.083% of the principal amount.
866374_12_ITEM8_P133_S1	The Company recognized a loss associated with the early redemption of the notes of approximately $13.2 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, consisting of the redemption price premium of approximately $6.3 million, and approximately $6.9 million primarily for the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs.
866374_12_ITEM8_P133_S2	The loss is recorded in other charges (income), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
866374_12_ITEM8_P134_S0	The Company transacts business in various foreign countries and is therefore, exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in forecasted sales, cost of sales, and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_12_ITEM8_P134_S1	The Company has established risk management programs to protect against volatility in the value of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, and of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
866374_12_ITEM8_P134_S2	The Company tries to maintain a partial or fully hedged position for certain transaction exposures, which are primarily, but not limited to, revenues, customer and vendor payments and inter-company balances in currencies other than the functional currency unit of the operating entity.
866374_12_ITEM8_P134_S3	The Company enters into short-term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities, primarily accounts receivable and accounts payable, and cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_12_ITEM8_P134_S4	Gains and losses on the Company's forward and swap contracts are designed to offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and transactions hedged, and accordingly, generally do not subject the Company to risk of significant accounting losses.
866374_12_ITEM8_P134_S5	The Company hedges committed exposures and does not engage in speculative transactions.
866374_12_ITEM8_P134_S6	The credit risk of these forward and swap contracts is minimized since the contracts are with large financial institutions and accordingly, fair value adjustments related to the credit risk of the counter-party financial institution were not material.
866374_12_ITEM8_P135_S0	As of March 31, 2012, the aggregate notional amount of the Company's outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts was $2.7 billion as summarized below:
866374_12_ITEM8_P136_S0	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of the Company's short-term foreign currency contracts was not material and included in other current assets or other current liabilities, as applicable, in the consolidated balance sheets.
866374_12_ITEM8_P136_S1	Certain of these contracts are designed to economically hedge the Company's exposure to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and are not accounted for as hedges under the accounting standards.
866374_12_ITEM8_P136_S2	Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change as a component of interest and other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_12_ITEM8_P136_S3	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company also has included net deferred gains and losses, respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets, relating to changes in fair value of its foreign currency contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
866374_12_ITEM8_P136_S4	These deferred gains and losses were not material, and the deferred losses as of March 31, 2012 are expected to be recognized as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations primarily over the next twelve month period.
866374_12_ITEM8_P137_S0	ineffectiveness were not material for all fiscal years presented and are included as a component of interest and other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_12_ITEM8_P138_S0	The following table presents the fair value of the Company's derivative instruments located on the consolidated balance sheets utilized for foreign currency risk management purposes at March 31, 2012 and 2011:
866374_12_ITEM8_P139_S0	The Company sells trade receivables under two asset-backed securitization programs and an accounts receivable factoring program.
866374_12_ITEM8_P140_S0	The Company continuously sells designated pools of trade receivables under its Global Asset-Backed Securitization Agreement (the "Global Program") and its North American Asset-Backed Securitization Agreement (the "North American Program," collectively, the "ABS Programs") to affiliated special purpose entities, each of which in turn sells 100% of the receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions.
866374_12_ITEM8_P140_S1	These programs allow the operating subsidiaries to receive a cash payment and a deferred purchase price receivable for sold receivables.
866374_12_ITEM8_P140_S2	Following the transfer of the receivables to the special purpose entities, the transferred receivables are isolated from the Company and its affiliates, and upon the sale of the receivables from the special purpose entity to the unaffiliated financial institutions effective control of the transferred receivables is passed to the unaffiliated financial institutions, which has the right to pledge or sell the receivables.
866374_12_ITEM8_P140_S3	Although the special purpose entities are consolidated by the Company, they are separate corporate entities and their assets are available first to satisfy the claims of their creditors.
866374_12_ITEM8_P140_S4	The investment limits by the financial institutions are $500.0 million for the Global Program and $300.0 million for the North American Program and require a minimum level of deferred purchase price receivable to be retained by the Company in connection with the sales.
866374_12_ITEM8_P141_S0	The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the special purpose entities and receives a servicing fee of 0.5% to 1.00% of serviced receivables per annum.
866374_12_ITEM8_P142_S0	included in interest and other expense, net within the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_12_ITEM8_P142_S1	As the Company estimates the fee it receives in return for its obligation to service these receivables is at fair value, no servicing assets and liabilities are recognized.
866374_12_ITEM8_P143_S0	Effective April 1, 2010, the Company adopted two new accounting standards, the first of which removed the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and created more stringent conditions for reporting the transfer of a financial asset as a sale.
866374_12_ITEM8_P143_S1	The second standard amended the consolidation guidance for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.
866374_12_ITEM8_P143_S2	As a result of the adoption of the second standard, the Company was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the special purpose entity to which the pool of trade receivables was sold under the Global Program and, as such, was required to consolidate the special purpose entity; the Company had previously been consolidating the special purpose entity under the North American Program.
866374_12_ITEM8_P143_S3	The North American Program was amended effective April 1, 2010 and the Global Program was amended effective September 29, 2010 in each case to provide for the sale by the special purpose entities of 100% of the eligible receivables to the unaffiliated financial institutions; previously the special purpose entities had retained a partial interest in the sold receivables.
866374_12_ITEM8_P143_S4	Upon adoption of these standards, the balance of receivables sold for cash under the Global Program as of April 1, 2010, totaling $217.1 million, was recorded as accounts receivable and short-term bank borrowings in the opening balance sheet of fiscal 2011.
866374_12_ITEM8_P143_S5	Upon collection of these receivables the Company recorded cash from operations offset by repayments of bank borrowings from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows during the year ended March 31, 2011.
866374_12_ITEM8_P143_S6	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, the accounts receivable balances that were sold under the ABS Programs were removed from the consolidated balance sheets and the net cash proceeds received by the Company were included as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
866374_12_ITEM8_P144_S0	Although the Company still consolidates the special purpose entities, as a result of the amendments to the North American Program effective April 1, 2010 and the Global Program on September 29, 2010, all of the receivables sold to the unaffiliated financial institutions for cash are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the cash received is no longer accounted for as a secured borrowing.
866374_12_ITEM8_P144_S1	The portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid by the unaffiliated financial institutions in cash is a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid to the special purpose entity as payments on the receivables are collected from account debtors.
866374_12_ITEM8_P144_S2	The deferred purchase price receivable represents a beneficial interest in the transferred financial assets and is recognized at fair value as part of the sale transaction.
866374_12_ITEM8_P145_S0	As of March 31, 2012, approximately $1.1 billion of accounts receivable had been sold to the special purpose entities under the ABS Programs for which the Company had received net cash proceeds of $556.8 million and deferred purchase price receivables of approximately $514.9 million.
866374_12_ITEM8_P145_S1	As of March 31, 2011, approximately $1.0 billion of accounts receivable had been sold to the special purpose entities for which the Company had received net cash proceeds of $545.0 million and deferred purchase price receivables of approximately $460.0 million.
866374_12_ITEM8_P145_S2	The deferred purchase price receivables are included in other current assets as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, and were carried at the expected recovery amount of the related receivables.
866374_12_ITEM8_P146_S0	amounts were $10.9 million, $8.0 million and $7.8 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM8_P147_S0	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, cash flows from sales of receivables under the ABS Programs consisted of approximately $4.7 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively for transfers of receivables (of which approximately $0.6 billion, $0.6 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively represented new transfers and the remainder proceeds from collections reinvested in revolving-period transfers).
866374_12_ITEM8_P148_S0	The following table summarizes the activity in the deferred purchase price receivables account during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011:
866374_12_ITEM8_P149_S0	The Company also sold accounts receivables to certain third-party banking institutions.
866374_12_ITEM8_P149_S1	The outstanding balance of receivables sold and not yet collected was approximately $110.5 million and $109.7 million as of March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM8_P149_S2	For the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, total accounts receivables sold to certain third party banking institutions was approximately $2.0 billion, $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM8_P149_S3	The receivables that were sold were removed from the consolidated balance sheets and were reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
866374_12_ITEM8_P150_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
866374_12_ITEM8_P150_S1	When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact, and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
866374_12_ITEM8_P151_S0	The accounting guidance for fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.
866374_12_ITEM8_P151_S1	A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
866374_12_ITEM8_P151_S2	The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
866374_12_ITEM8_P152_S0	Level 1 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
866374_12_ITEM8_P153_S0	The Company has deferred compensation plans for its officers and certain other employees.
866374_12_ITEM8_P154_S0	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets are included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets and include investments in equity securities and mutual funds that are valued using active market prices.
866374_12_ITEM8_P155_S0	The Company values available for sale investments using level 1 inputs which are active market trading prices.
866374_12_ITEM8_P156_S0	Level 2 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
866374_12_ITEM8_P157_S0	The Company values foreign exchange forward contracts using level 2 observable inputs which primarily consist of an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
866374_12_ITEM8_P158_S0	The Company's cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits and money market funds, which are valued using level 2 inputs, such as interest rates and maturity periods.
866374_12_ITEM8_P158_S1	Due to their short-term nature, their carrying amount approximates fair value.
866374_12_ITEM8_P159_S0	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets also include money market funds, mutual funds, corporate and government bonds and certain convertible securities that are valued using prices obtained from various pricing sources.
866374_12_ITEM8_P159_S1	These sources price these investments using certain market indices and the performance of these investments in relation to these indices.
866374_12_ITEM8_P159_S2	As a result, the Company has classified these investments as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
866374_12_ITEM8_P160_S0	Level 3 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
866374_12_ITEM8_P161_S0	The Company values deferred purchase price receivables relating to its Asset-Backed Securitization Program based on a discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable inputs (i.e. level 3 inputs), which are primarily risk free interest rates adjusted for the credit quality of the underlying creditor and due to its high credit quality and short term maturity their fair value approximates carrying value.
866374_12_ITEM8_P161_S1	Significant increases in either of the significant unobservable inputs (credit spread, risk free interest rate) in isolation would result in lower fair value estimates but is insignificant.
866374_12_ITEM8_P161_S2	The interrelationship between these inputs is insignificant.
866374_12_ITEM8_P162_S0	There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the fiscal years 2012 and 2011.
866374_12_ITEM8_P163_S0	The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2012 and 2011:
866374_12_ITEM8_P164_S0	There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the twelve month periods ended March 31, 2012 and 2011.
866374_12_ITEM8_P164_S1	Refer to note 8, "Trade Receivable Securitization", for a reconciliation of the changes in the deferred purchase price receivable.
866374_12_ITEM8_P165_S0	The following table presents the Company's liabilities not carried at fair value as at March 31, 2012 and 2011:
866374_12_ITEM8_P166_S0	The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short term nature of the interest rates underlying any borrowings under this facility, though the facility itself is available to the Company on a long term basis.
866374_12_ITEM8_P167_S0	Term loans dated October 1, 2007 and October 19, 2011 The term loans are valued based on broker trading prices in active markets.
866374_12_ITEM8_P168_S0	Asia term loans The Company's Asia Term Loans are not traded publicly; however, as the pricing, maturity and other pertinent terms of these loans closely approximate those of the Term Loan Agreements dated October 1, 2007, and October 19, 2011, management estimates the respective trading prices would be approximately the same.
866374_12_ITEM8_P169_S0	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, assets that were no longer in use and held for sale totaled approximately $16.7 million and $27.1 million, respectively, excluding assets that have been identified as relating to discontinued operations discussed further in note 18.
866374_12_ITEM8_P169_S1	The assets held for sale primarily represent manufacturing facilities that have been closed as part of the Company's historical facility consolidations.
866374_12_ITEM8_P169_S2	These assets are recorded at the lesser of carrying value or fair value, which is based on comparable sales from prevailing market data (level two inputs).
866374_12_ITEM8_P169_S3	There were no material fair value adjustments during fiscal years 2012 and 2011.
866374_12_ITEM8_P169_S4	There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy for these assets during the fiscal years 2012 and 2011.
866374_12_ITEM8_P170_S0	As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, the gross carrying amount and associated accumulated depreciation of the Company's property and equipment financed under capital leases, and the related obligations was not material.
866374_12_ITEM8_P171_S0	These operating leases expire in various years through 2028 and require the following minimum lease payments:
866374_12_ITEM8_P172_S0	Total rent expense amounted to $160.5 million, $153.2 million, and $143.2 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM8_P173_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
866374_12_ITEM8_P173_S1	We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims.
866374_12_ITEM8_P173_S2	Although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management expects that any losses that are probable or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of these matters, which are in excess of amounts already accrued in its consolidated balance sheet, would not be material to the financial statements as a whole.
866374_12_ITEM8_P174_S0	The domestic (Singapore) and foreign components of income before income taxes were comprised of the following:
866374_12_ITEM8_P175_S0	The provision for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following:
866374_12_ITEM8_P176_S0	The domestic statutory income tax rate was approximately 17.0% in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010.
866374_12_ITEM8_P176_S1	The reconciliation of the income tax expense (benefit) expected based on domestic statutory income tax rates to the expense (benefit) for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows:
866374_12_ITEM8_P177_S0	A number of countries in which the Company is located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business.
866374_12_ITEM8_P177_S1	In general, these holidays were secured based on the nature, size and location of the Company's operations.
866374_12_ITEM8_P177_S2	The aggregate dollar effect on the Company's income resulting from tax holidays and tax incentives to attract and retain business for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $41.8 million, $66.5 million and $65.4 million, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM8_P177_S3	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share was $0.06 and $0.06, respectively, and the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were $0.09 and $0.08, and $0.08 and $0.08, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM8_P178_S0	Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, the Company's existing holidays will expire in the fiscal years ending March 31, 2013 through fiscal 2018.
866374_12_ITEM8_P179_S0	Under its territorial tax system, Singapore generally does not tax foreign sourced income until repatriated to Singapore.
866374_12_ITEM8_P179_S1	The Company has included the effects of Singapore's territorial tax system in the rate differential line above.
866374_12_ITEM8_P180_S0	fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $17.7 million, $32.6 million and $20.0 million, respectively.
866374_12_ITEM8_P181_S0	The components of deferred income taxes are as follows:
866374_12_ITEM8_P182_S0	The Company has tax loss carryforwards of approximately $8.4 billion, a portion of which started expiring during 2013.
866374_12_ITEM8_P182_S1	Utilization of the tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets is limited by the future earnings of the Company in the tax jurisdictions in which such deferred assets arose.
866374_12_ITEM8_P182_S2	As a result, management is uncertain as to when or whether these operations will generate sufficient profit to realize any benefit from the deferred tax assets.
866374_12_ITEM8_P183_S0	The valuation allowance provides a reserve against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized by the Company.
866374_12_ITEM8_P183_S1	However, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize certain of these benefits and, accordingly, has recognized a deferred tax asset from these benefits.
866374_12_ITEM8_P183_S2	The change in valuation allowance is net of certain increases and decreases to prior year losses and other carryforwards that have no current impact on the tax provision.
866374_12_ITEM8_P183_S3	Approximately $34.0 million of the valuation allowance relates to income tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options, which if realized will be credited directly to shareholders' equity and will not be available to benefit the income tax provision in any future period.
866374_12_ITEM8_P184_S0	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced or increased in the near-term if facts, including the amount of taxable income or the mix of taxable income between subsidiaries, differ from management's estimates.
866374_12_ITEM8_P185_S0	The Company does not provide for income taxes on approximately $570.0 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of March 31, 2012, as such earnings are not intended by management to be repatriated in the foreseeable future.
866374_12_ITEM8_P185_S1	Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
866374_12_ITEM8_P186_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
866374_12_ITEM8_P187_S0	The Company's unrecognized tax benefits are subject to change over the next twelve months primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and as audits are settled.
866374_12_ITEM8_P187_S1	The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by an estimated range of $26.0 - $32.0 million within the next twelve months primarily due to potential settlements of various audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.
866374_12_ITEM8_P188_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file federal, state, and local income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions around the world.

866374_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements or prevent or detect instances of fraud.
866374_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
866374_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
866374_12_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

866374_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
866374_12_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
866374_12_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
866374_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

866374_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
866374_12_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_12_ITEM9A_P9_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

866374_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a globally-recognized leading provider of end-to-end, global supply chain solutions through which we design, build, ship and service a complete packaged electronic product to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") in the following markets:
866374_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	High Reliability Solutions ("HRS"), which is comprised of our medical, automotive, defense and aerospace businesses; High Velocity Solutions ("HVS"), which includes our mobile devices business, including smart phones, and consumer electronics, including game consoles, high-volume computing business, including notebook personal computing ("PC"), tablets and printers; Industrial and Emerging Industries ("IEI"), which is comprised of our large household appliances, equipment, and emerging industries businesses; and Integrated Network Solutions ("INS"), which includes our telecommunications infrastructure, data networking, connected home, and server and storage businesses.
866374_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	We provide our advanced design, manufacturing and services through a network of facilities in over 30 countries across four continents.
866374_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	We have established this extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world's major electronics markets (Asia, the Americas and Europe) in order to serve the outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our services increase customer competitiveness by delivering improved product quality, leading manufacturability, improved performance, faster time-to-market and reduced costs.
866374_13_ITEM1_P2_S3	Our OEM customers leverage our services to meet their requirements throughout their products' entire life cycles.
866374_13_ITEM1_P2_S4	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, we had revenue of $23.6 billion and net income of $277.1 million.
866374_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	We believe that the combination of our extensive design and engineering services, significant scale and global presence, end-to-end services, advanced supply chain management, industrial parks in low-cost geographic areas and operational track record provide us with a competitive advantage in the market for designing, manufacturing and servicing electronics products for leading multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	Through these services and facilities, we offer our OEM customers the ability to simplify their global product development, their manufacturing process, their after sales services and enable our OEM customers to achieve meaningful reductions to time-to-market and costs.
866374_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our business has been subject to seasonality primarily due to our mobile devices market and our consumer devices market, which historically exhibit particular strength in the two quarters leading up to the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our expertise is in the design, manufacturing and services for a broad range of products, and as such, the closest definition of our industry is the outsourcing Electronics Manufacturing Services ("EMS") industry.
866374_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	EMS has experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elected to outsource some or all of their design, manufacturing, and distribution requirements.
866374_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	We have seen an increase in global OEM manufacturing demand since the 2001 - 2002 technology downturn as more and more OEMs pursued the benefits of outsourcing rather than internal manufacturing.
866374_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	Due to the global economic crisis, which began in late calendar year 2007 and continued through the end of our fiscal year 2010, many of our OEM customers reduced their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing which negatively impacted our business.
866374_13_ITEM1_P5_S4	In fiscal year 2011, we began seeing some positive signs that demand for our OEM customers' end products was improving, and this trend continued through the end of our 2012 fiscal year.
866374_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	volume and low margin Original Design and Manufacturing ("ODM") PC business last year.
866374_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	The EMS industry has not fully recovered from the last macro-economic downturn and as a result, during fiscal 2013 the Company initiated certain restructuring activities intended to improve operational efficiencies.
866374_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	The growth of the overall industry for calendar 2012 is estimated to have been greater than 4%.
866374_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe the total available market for outsourcing EMS continues to offer opportunities for growth with current penetration rates estimated to be less than 23%.
866374_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	The intensely competitive nature of the electronics industry, the continually increasing complexity and sophistication of electronics products, pressure on OEMs to reduce product costs and shorter product life cycles encourage OEMs to utilize broad manufacturing and service providers as part of their business and manufacturing strategies.
866374_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	Utilizing global manufacturing and service providers allows OEMs to take advantage of the global design, manufacturing and supply chain management expertise of such providers, and enables OEMs to concentrate on product research, development, marketing and sales.
866374_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	We believe that OEMs realize the following benefits through their strategic relationships with manufacturing and service providers:
866374_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Reduced production costs; Reduced design and development costs and lead time; Accelerated time-to-market and time-to-volume production; Reduced capital investment requirements and fixed costs; Improved inventory management and purchasing power; Access to worldwide design, engineering, manufacturing, and after-market service capabilities; and Ability to focus on core branding and R D initiatives.
866374_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe that growth in the EMS industry will be driven largely by the needs of OEMs to respond to rapidly changing markets and technologies and to reduce product costs.
866374_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Additionally, we believe that there are significant opportunities for global manufacturing and service providers to win additional business from OEMs in certain markets or industry segments that have yet to substantially utilize such providers.
866374_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	We offer a broad range of customer-tailored services to OEMs.
866374_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe that Flextronics has the broadest worldwide capabilities in the industry, from design resources to end-to-end global supply chain services.
866374_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	We believe a key competitive advantage is our ability to provide more value and innovation to our customers because we offer both global economies of scale in procurement, manufacturing and after-market services, as well as market-focused expertise and capabilities in design and engineering.
866374_13_ITEM1_P12_S3	As a result of our focus on specific markets, we believe we are able to better understand complex market dynamics and anticipate trends that impact our OEM customers' businesses, and can help improve our OEM customers' market positioning by effectively adjusting product plans and roadmaps to deliver low-cost, high quality products and meet their time-to-market requirements.

866374_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as the regulations.
866374_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	programs vary from collecting compliance or material data from our Flextronics owned suppliers to full laboratory testing, and we require our supply chain to comply.
866374_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	In the case of WEEE, although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations.
866374_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	New technical classifications of e-Waste being discussed in the Basel Convention technical working group could affect both Flextronics and Flextronics' customers abilities and obligations in electronics repair and refurbishment.
866374_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	Flextronics continues to monitor these discussions and is working with our customers and other technical organizations to minimize the impact to legal and responsibly managed repair operations.
866374_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	As of March 31, 2013, our global workforce totaled approximately 149,000 employees.
866374_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by work councils.
866374_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	We have never experienced a significant work stoppage or strike, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
866374_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees.
866374_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	The loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business, results of operations and business prospects.
866374_13_ITEM1_P75_S2	To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel.
866374_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	We own or license various United States and foreign patents relating to a variety of technologies.
866374_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	For certain of our proprietary processes, we rely on trade secret protection.
866374_13_ITEM1_P76_S2	We also have registered our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the United States and other countries throughout the world.
866374_13_ITEM1_P76_S3	As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying value of our intellectual property was not material.
866374_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it, from time to time third parties do assert patent infringement claims against us or our customers.
866374_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	In addition, we provide design and engineering services to our customers and designing and making our own products.
866374_13_ITEM1_P77_S2	As a consequence of these activities, our customers are requiring us to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses.
866374_13_ITEM1_P77_S3	If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_13_ITEM1_P77_S4	Such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor.
866374_13_ITEM1_P77_S5	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome.
866374_13_ITEM1_P77_S6	We also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services.
866374_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	Refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for financial information about our geographic areas.
866374_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	We make available through our Internet website the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
866374_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	We were incorporated in the Republic of Singapore in May 1990.
866374_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	Our principal corporate office is located at 2 Changi South Lane, Singapore 486123.
866374_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	Our U.S. corporate headquarters is located at 6201 America Center Drive, San Jose, CA, 95002.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We depend on industries that continually produce technologically advanced products with short life cycles and our business would be adversely affected if our customers' products are not successful or if our customers lose market share.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We derive our revenues from customers in the following markets:
866374_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	HRS, which is comprised of our medical, automotive, defense and aerospace businesses; HVS, which includes our mobile devices business, including smart phones, and consumer electronics, including game consoles, high-volume computing business, including notebook personal computing ("PC"), tablets and printers; IEI, which is comprised of our large household appliances, equipment, and emerging industries businesses; and INS, which includes our telecommunications infrastructure, data networking, connected home, and server and storage businesses.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Factors affecting any of these industries in general or our customers in particular, could adversely impact us.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	rapid changes in technology, evolving industry standards and requirements for continuous improvement in products and services result in short product life cycles; demand for our customers' products may be seasonal; our customers may fail to successfully market their products, and our customers' products may fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance; our customers may experience dramatic market share shifts in demand which may cause them to exit the business; and there may be recessionary periods in our customers' markets, such as the recent global economic downturn.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and the inherent difficulties involved in responding to these demands could harm our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers have harmed, and may continue to harm, our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and deliver for these customers, by causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and by lowering our asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Additionally, current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our capabilities against other providers as well as against the merits of manufacturing products themselves.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	business would be adversely affected if OEMs decide to perform these functions internally or transfer their business to another provider.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	As a provider of electronics design and manufacturing services and components, we must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround time for our customers.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and we often experience reduced lead times in customer orders which may be less than the lead time we require to procure necessary components and materials.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of our customers.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	This makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In that regard, we must make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, setting production schedules, making component procurement commitments, and allocating personnel and other resources, based on our estimates of our customers' requirements.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production or require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to reduce costs or achieve other objectives.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	These demands stress our resources and reduce our margins.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands, and transfers from one facility to another can result in inefficiencies and costs due to excess capacity in one facility and corresponding capacity constraints at another.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Due to many of our costs and operating expenses being relatively fixed, customer order fluctuations, deferrals and transfers of demand from one facility to another, as described above, have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past and we may experience such effects in the future.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our industry is extremely competitive; if we are not able to continue to provide competitive services, we may lose business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We compete with a number of different companies, depending on the type of service we provide or the location of our operations.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	For example, we compete with major global EMS providers, other smaller EMS companies that have a regional or product-specific focus and ODMs with respect to some of the services that we provide.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We also compete with our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our industry is extremely competitive, many of our competitors have achieved substantial market share, and some may have lower cost structures or greater design, manufacturing, financial or other resources than we do.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We face particular competition from Asian-based competitors, including Taiwanese ODM suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If we are unable to provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at lower cost than the other companies in our market, our net sales could decline.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a decline in sales to any of these customers could adversely affect our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Sales to our ten largest customers represent a significant percentage of our net sales.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 47%, 55% and 52% of net sales in fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	No customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2013.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Our largest customers during fiscal year 2012 were Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Research In Motion (RIM), which each accounted for more than 10% of net sales.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Our largest customer during fiscal year 2011 was Research In Motion which accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2011.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P14_S6	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2011.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our principal customers have varied from year to year.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	position, due to economic or other forces, that may cause them to reduce their purchases from us or, in some cases, result in the termination of their relationship with us.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Significant reductions in sales to any of these customers, or the loss of major customers, would materially harm our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If we are not able to timely replace expired, canceled or reduced contracts with new business, our revenues and profitability could be harmed.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our components business is dependent on our ability to quickly launch world-class components products, and our investment in the development of our component capabilities, together with the start-up and integration costs necessary to achieve quick launches of world-class components products, may adversely affect our margins and profitability.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our components business, which includes rigid and flexible printed circuit board fabrication, and power supplies manufacturing, is part of our strategy to improve our competitive position and to grow our future margins, profitability and shareholder returns by expanding our capabilities.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The success of our components business is dependent on our ability to design and introduce world-class components that have performance characteristics which are suitable for a broad market and that offer significant price and/or performance advantages over competitive products.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	To create these world class components offerings, we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our components capabilities, in resources such as research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, facility expansions and personnel requirements.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We may not be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance for any of our components offerings in any of our current or target markets.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The success of our components business will also depend upon the level of market acceptance of our customers' end products, which incorporate our components, and over which we have no control.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition, OEMs often require unique configurations or custom designs which must be developed and integrated in the OEM's product well before the product is launched by the OEM.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Thus, there is often substantial lead time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized component and the commencement of volume shipments of the component to the OEM.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	As a result, we may make substantial investments in the development and customization of products for our customers, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not accept the customized component.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Even if our customers accept the customized component, if our customers do not purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our achievement of anticipated levels of profitability in our components business is also dependent on our ability to achieve efficiencies in our manufacturing as well as to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our OEM customers.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability in our components business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our products from these customers could decline.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty we could have difficulty sourcing supply necessary to fulfil production requirements and meet scheduled shipments.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivable are outstanding.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We may be adversely affected by shortages of required electronic components.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	From time to time, we have experienced shortages of some of the electronic components that we use.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	These shortages can result from strong demand for those components or from problems experienced by suppliers, such as shortages of raw materials.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	These unanticipated component shortages could result in curtailed production or delays in production, which may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a reduction in sales, increase in inventory levels and costs, and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Component shortages may also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P26_S5	As a result, component shortages could adversely affect our operating results.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to incorporate changes in component costs into the selling prices for our products.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our supply chain may also be impacted by other events outside our control, including macro-economic events, political crises or natural or environmental occurrences.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Component shortages impacted our results during the second half of fiscal year 2010, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and during fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The supply constraints were broad based, but the impact was most evident with respect to connectors, capacitors, LCD panels and memory (both DRAM and Flash).
866374_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	These shortages began to abate during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, and supplies had normalized by the end of the third quarter.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	In addition, the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan resulted in disruptions to our supply chain, as a large number of our suppliers of semiconductors and other electronic components are located in Japan.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P27_S5	These disruptions had a negative impact on our revenue in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P27_S6	We also continue to evaluate the extent of the disruption to our supply chain and the impact on our business caused by the flooding in Thailand during the second half of 2011, which had a negative impact on our revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, as a number of our suppliers of hard disk drives and other electronic components maintain facilities in Thailand.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our margins and profitability may be adversely affected due to substantial investments, start-up and production ramping costs in our design services.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	As part of our strategy to enhance our end-to-end service offerings, we have expanded and continue to expand our design and engineering capabilities.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Providing these services can expose us to different or greater potential risks than those we face when providing our manufacturing services.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Although we enter into contracts with our design services customers, we may design and develop products for these customers prior to receiving a purchase order or other firm commitment from them.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We are required to make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Even if our customers accept our designs, if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Our design activities often require that we purchase inventory for initial production runs before we have a purchase commitment from a customer.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Even after we have a contract with a customer with respect to a product, these contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any particular volume of purchases.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P30_S5	These contracts can generally be terminated on short notice.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P30_S6	In addition, some of the products we design and develop must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some must receive government certifications.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P30_S7	If we fail to obtain these approvals or certifications on a timely basis, we would be unable to sell these products, which would harm our sales, profitability and reputation.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Due to the increased risks associated with our design services offerings, we may not be able to achieve a high enough level of sales for this business, and the significant investments in research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, patent applications, facility expansion and recruitment that it requires, to be profitable.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The initial costs of investing in the resources necessary to expand our design and engineering capabilities, and in particular to support our design services offerings, have historically adversely affected our profitability, and may continue to do so as we continue to make investments in these capabilities.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In addition, we agree to certain product price limitations and cost reduction targets in connection with these services.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Inflationary and other increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor required to produce the products have occurred and may recur from time to time.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Also, the production ramps for these programs are typically significant and negatively impact our margin in early stages as the manufacturing volumes are lower and result in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	We may not be able to reduce costs, incorporate changes in costs into the selling prices of our products, or increase operating efficiencies as we ramp production of our products, which would adversely affect our margins and our results of operations.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for medical devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	As a medical device manufacturer, we have additional compliance requirements.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We are required to register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring by the FDA.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance with QSR or other FDA regulations, and the Company does not address the observation adequately to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA may take action against us.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	FDA actions may include issuing a letter of inspectional observations, issuing a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the Company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, refusing requests for clearance or approval of new products or withdrawal of clearance or approval previously granted, issuing an import detention on products entering the U.S. from an offshore facility, or shutting down a manufacturing facility.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P34_S5	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In the European Union ("EU"), we are required to maintain certain standardized certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections to obtain and maintain these certifications.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Continued noncompliance to the EU regulations could stop the flow of products into the EU from us or from our customers.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In China, the Safe Food and Drug Administration controls and regulates the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We must comply with the regulatory laws applicable to medical device manufactures or our ability to manufacture products in China could be impacted.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In Japan, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws regulate the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	These regulations also require that subcontractors manufacturing products intended for sale in Japan register with authorities and submit to regulatory audits.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Other Asian countries where we operate have similar laws regarding the regulation of medical device manufacturing.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to risks of international operations.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The distances between the Americas, Asia and Europe create a number of logistical and communications challenges for us.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	components and raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations, and coordinating the activities and decisions of the core management team, which is based in a number of different countries.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Facilities in several different locations may be involved at different stages of the production of a single product, leading to additional logistical difficulties.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Because our manufacturing operations are located in a number of countries throughout the Americas, Asia and Europe, we are subject to the risks of changes in economic and political conditions in those countries, including:
866374_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	fluctuations in the value of local currencies; labor unrest, difficulties in staffing and geographic labor shortages; longer payment cycles; cultural differences; increases in duties and taxation levied on our products; imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds; limitations on imports or exports of components or assembled products, or other travel restrictions; expropriation of private enterprises; exposure to infectious disease and epidemics; and a potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The attractiveness of our services to U.S. customers can be affected by changes in U.S. trade policies, such as most favored nation status and trade preferences for some Asian countries.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, some countries in which we operate, such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Mexico, Malaysia and Poland, have experienced periods of slow or negative growth, high inflation, significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Furthermore, in countries such as China and Mexico, governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy, and their actions could have a significant effect on us.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure, including lack of adequate power and water supplies, transportation, raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P43_S4	In addition, we may encounter labor disruptions and rising labor costs, in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Any increase in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In some countries, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert our cash distributions to U.S. dollars or other freely convertible currencies, or to move funds from our accounts in these countries.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Furthermore, the central bank of any of these countries may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to approve distributions to foreign investors.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Another significant legal risk resulting from our international operations is compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local laws of the countries in which we do business, including the UK Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits covered companies from making payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	or to improperly influence a decision regarding Flextronics.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents will refrain from taking actions in violation of this and our related anti-corruption policies and procedures.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	If our security systems and governance policies are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We have implemented security systems and governance policies with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and inventory and protecting our customers' and our suppliers' confidential information.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Despite such efforts, we are subject to, and at times have suffered from, breach of these security systems and governance policies which have in the past and may in the future result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or unauthorized use or theft of the inventory or information we are trying to protect.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If unauthorized parties gain physical access to our inventory or if they gain electronic access to our information systems or if such information or inventory is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information or inventory could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties including our customers and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information or inventory, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from the breach of our security systems.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of "conflict minerals" may result in increased costs and risks to us.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The disclosure rules will take effect for the Company in May 2014.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	We may have to publicly disclose whether the products we sell contain conflict minerals and could incur significant costs related to implementing a process that will meet the mandates of the Act.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Additionally, customers rely on us to provide critical data regarding the products they purchase and will likely request conflict mineral information.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Our materials sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and we may not be able to easily verify the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P50_S5	We have many suppliers and each may provide conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, our reputation may suffer if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals, if any, used in its products.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P50_S7	Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P50_S8	The implementation of this requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from our suppliers.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P50_S9	This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide conflict free products and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are subject to the risk of increased income taxes.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The Company is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The Company's future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P52_S3	For example, on March 16, 2007, the Chinese government passed a new unified enterprise income tax law which became effective on January 1, 2008.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	applicable to our subsidiaries in China.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Under the new law, the tax rates applicable to the operations of most of our subsidiaries in China have been increased to 25%.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	The new law provided a transition rule which increased the tax rate to 25% over a 5-year period, which ended in 2012.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P53_S3	The new law also increased the standard withholding rate on earnings distributions to between 5% and 10% depending on the residence of the shareholder.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P53_S4	The ultimate effect of these and other changes in Chinese tax laws on our overall tax rate will be affected by, among other things, our China income, the manner in which China interprets, implements and applies the new tax provisions, and our ability to qualify for any exceptions or new incentives.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Similarly, we recently renewed a Malaysian tax holiday that expired on January 31, 2012 for another ten year period.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Our continued ability to qualify for specific tax holiday extensions will depend on, among other things, our anticipated investment and expansion in these countries and the manner in which the local governments interpret the requirements for extensions or new incentives.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions around the world.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	However, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax provision, operating results, financial position and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	If our products or components contain defects, demand for our services may decline and we may be exposed to product liability and product warranty liability.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation and expose us to product liability or product warranty claims.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Product liability claims may include liability for personal injury or property damage.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Product warranty claims may include liability to pay for the recall, repair or replacement of a product or component.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Although we generally allocate liability for these claims in our contracts with our customers, increasingly we are unsuccessful in allocating such liability, and even where we have allocated liability to our customers, our customers may not have the resources to satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product or component for which they have assumed responsibility.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If we design, engineer or manufacture a product or component that is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could spend a significant amount of money to resolve the claim.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In addition, product liability and product recall insurance coverage are expensive and may not be available with respect to all of our services offerings on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	A successful product liability or product warranty claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied, limited or is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	If we do not effectively manage changes in our operations, our business may be harmed; we have taken substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may need to take material restructuring charges in the future.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	In recent years, we have experienced growth in our business through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	However, our business also has been negatively impacted by the recent adverse global economic conditions.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P61_S2	The expansion of our business, as well as business contractions and other changes in our customers' requirements, have in the past, and may in the future, require that we adjust our business and cost structures by incurring restructuring charges.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Restructuring activities involve reductions in our workforce at some locations and closure of certain facilities.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P61_S4	All of these changes have in the past placed, and may in the future place, considerable strain on our management control systems and resources, including decision support, accounting management, information systems and facilities.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P61_S5	If we do not properly manage our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures to manage our employees, our business could be harmed.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In recent years, including during fiscal 2013, we undertook initiatives to restructure our business operations through a series of restructuring activities, which were intended to realign our global capacity and infrastructure with demand by our OEM customers and thereby improve our operational efficiency.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	These activities included reducing excess workforce and capacity, transitioning manufacturing to lower-cost locations and eliminating redundant facilities, and consolidating and eliminating certain administrative facilities.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	While we incur severance, asset impairment charges and other facilities charges as a result of changes in our customer mix on an ongoing basis, such individual actions were not considered material to be separately disclosed as restructuring charges in fiscal year 2012 and 2011, and are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Our restructuring activities undertaken during fiscal 2013 have been disclosed separately on our statement of operations due to the significant nature of such activities.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We may be required to take additional charges in the future to align our operations and cost structures with global economic conditions, market demands, cost competitiveness, and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers' production requirements.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P63_S3	We may consolidate certain manufacturing facilities or transfer certain of our operations to lower cost geographies.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P63_S4	If we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Additionally, there are other potential risks associated with our restructurings that could adversely affect us, such as delays encountered with the finalization and implementation of the restructuring activities, work stoppages, and the failure to achieve targeted cost savings.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The success of certain of our activities depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We retain certain intellectual property rights to some of the technologies that we develop as part of our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The measures we have taken to prevent unauthorized use of our technology may not be successful.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P65_S2	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties, as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our customers.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P66_S1	In addition, our customers are increasingly requiring us to indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P66_S2	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our operating costs.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our manufacturing operations and industrial parks are located in lower cost regions of the world, such as Asia, Eastern Europe and Mexico; however, most of our purchase and sale transactions are denominated in United States dollars, Japanese yen or Euros.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P69_S1	As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in the functional currencies of our fixed cost overhead or our supply base relative to the currencies in which we conduct transactions.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors, including changes in a country's political and economic policies.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Volatility in the functional and non-functional currencies of our entities and the United States dollar could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The primary impact of currency exchange fluctuations is on the cash, receivables, and payables of our operating entities.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	As part of our currency hedging strategy, we use financial instruments, primarily forward exchange and swap contracts, to hedge our United States dollar and other currency commitments in order to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on current assets and liabilities.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P71_S2	If our hedging activities are not successful or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We are also exposed to risks related to the valuation of the Chinese currency relative to other foreign currencies.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The Chinese currency is the renminbi ("RMB").
866374_13_ITEM1A_P73_S1	A significant increase in the value of the RMB could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows by increasing both our manufacturing costs and the costs of our local supply base.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We depend on our executive officers and skilled management personnel.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Generally our employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P75_S3	We will need to recruit and retain skilled management personnel, and if we are not able to do so, our business could be harmed.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P75_S4	In addition, in connection with expanding our design services offerings, we must attract and retain experienced design engineers.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P75_S5	There is substantial competition in our industry for highly skilled employees.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P75_S6	Our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our design services offerings, which could adversely affect our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our failure to comply with environmental laws could adversely affect our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including regulations governing the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used in our manufacturing processes.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P77_S1	We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the recyclability of products, the materials that may be included in products, and our obligations to dispose of these products after end users have finished with them.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Additionally, we may be exposed to liability to our customers relating to the materials that may be included in the components that we procure for our customers' products.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Any violation or alleged violation by us of environmental laws could subject us to significant costs, fines or other penalties.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of global and local product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	In addition, new technical classifications of e-Waste being discussed in the Basel Convention technical working group could affect both our customers abilities and obligations in electronics repair and refurbishment.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Also of note is China's Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by EIPs regulation, commonly referred to as "China RoHS", which restricts the importation into and production within China of electrical equipment containing certain hazardous materials.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P81_S1	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as applicable regulations.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P82_S1	These programs may include collecting compliance data from our suppliers, full laboratory testing and public reporting of other environmental metrics such as carbon emissions, electronic waste and water, and we also require our supply chain to comply.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P82_S3	In the case of WEEE, the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P82_S4	However, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their obligations under WEEE.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P83_S1	If more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed, or the results of future testing and analyses at our current or former operating facilities indicate that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the air, ground and/or water, we may be subject to additional liability.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Additional environmental matters may arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations or adequately address contaminated sites could limit our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to incur significant expenses, which would harm our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We may encounter difficulties with acquisitions, which could harm our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We have completed numerous acquisitions of businesses and we may acquire additional businesses in the future.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Any future acquisitions may require additional equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, or additional debt financing, which could increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P85_S3	As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P86_S1	The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P86_S2	The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P86_S3	In addition, the integration of acquired businesses may require that we incur significant restructuring charges.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P87_S0	In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including:
866374_13_ITEM1A_P88_S0	increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital; lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business; and exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P89_S0	These and other factors have harmed, and in the future could harm, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Our strategic relationships with major customers create risks.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P91_S0	In the past, we have completed numerous strategic transactions with OEM customers.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Under these arrangements, we generally acquire inventory, equipment and other assets from the OEM, and lease or acquire their manufacturing facilities, while simultaneously entering into multi-year manufacturing and supply agreements for the production of their products.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P91_S2	We may pursue these OEM divestiture transactions in the future.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P91_S3	These arrangements entered into with divesting OEMs typically involve many risks, including the following:
866374_13_ITEM1A_P92_S0	we may need to pay a purchase price to the divesting OEMs that exceeds the value we ultimately may realize from the future business of the OEM; the integration of the acquired assets and facilities into our business may be time-consuming and costly, including the incurrence of restructuring charges; we, rather than the divesting OEM, bear the risk of excess capacity at the facility; we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies at the facility; we may be unable to meet the expectations of the OEM as to volume, product quality, timeliness and cost reductions; our supply agreements with the OEMs generally do not require any minimum volumes of purchase by the OEMs, and the actual volume of purchases may be less than anticipated; and if demand for the OEMs' products declines, the OEM may reduce its volume of purchases, and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other OEMs.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P93_S0	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P93_S1	In addition, these strategic arrangements have not, and in the future may not, result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings per share.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our business and operations could be adversely impacted by climate change initiatives.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Concern over climate change has led to international legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to seasonal demand.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Two of our significant end markets are the mobile devices market and the consumer devices market.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P98_S0	calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P98_S1	As a result, we have historically experienced stronger revenues in our second and third fiscal quarters as compared to our other fiscal quarters.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Economic or other factors leading to diminished orders in the end of the calendar year could harm our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our debt level may create limitations.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P100_S0	As of March 31, 2013, our total debt was approximately $2.1 billion.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P100_S1	This level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Changes in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital or to borrow additional funds.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our credit is rated by credit rating agencies.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Our 4.625% Notes and our 5.000% Notes are currently rated BB+ by Standard and Poor's ("S P") and Ba1 by Moody's, and are considered to be below "investment grade" debt by Moody's and S P.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Any further decline in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all; negatively impact the price of our common stock; increase our interest payments under some of our existing debt agreements; and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P102_S3	In addition, the interest rate payable on some of our credit facilities is subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit ratings change.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P102_S4	Thus, any potential future negative change in our credit rating may increase the interest rate payable on these credit facilities.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Weak global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and access to capital markets.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which our customers compete.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Recent adverse worldwide economic conditions, including the European sovereign debt crisis, have created challenging conditions in the electronics industry.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P105_S1	These conditions have resulted in reduced consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries, a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and high volatility in credit, fixed income and equity markets.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P106_S0	A continuation or worsening of the European sovereign debt crisis will likely have a negative effect on certain of our European customers and suppliers, which could harm our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P106_S1	In addition, longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P106_S2	If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other corporate purposes.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P107_S0	The market price of our ordinary shares is volatile.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P108_S0	The stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of companies, including technology companies.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P108_S1	These fluctuations have often been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P108_S2	The market for our ordinary shares has been and may in the future be subject to similar volatility.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P108_S3	Factors such as fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of technological innovations or events affecting other companies in the electronics industry, currency fluctuations, general market fluctuations, and macro-economic conditions may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P109_S0	The Company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P110_S1	The Company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P110_S2	The Company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P110_S3	The Company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Refer to Notes 1 and 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and 'critical accounting policies' in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P112_S0	A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the Company's businesses and the Company could be required to record impairment charges on its goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact the Company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the Company's consolidated statement of operations.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P112_S1	If the Company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the Company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing credit facilities, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in the payment of significant damages, which would reduce our net income.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P114_S0	We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, wages and overtime, discrimination, whistle-blowing, classification of employees and severance payments.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P114_S1	Enforcement activity relating to these laws, particularly outside of the United States, can increase as a result of increased media attention due to violations by other companies, changes in law, political and other factors.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P114_S2	There can be no assurance that we won't be found to have violated such laws in the future, due to a more aggressive enforcement posture by governmental authorities or for any other reason.
866374_13_ITEM1A_P114_S3	Any such violations could lead to the assessment of fines against us by federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees, which fines could be substantial and which would reduce our net income.
866374_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facilities consist of a global network of industrial parks, regional manufacturing operations, and design, engineering and product introduction centers, providing over 27.6 million square feet of productive capacity as of March 31, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own facilities with approximately 8.7 million square feet in Asia, 4.4 million square feet in the Americas and 2.4 million square feet in Europe.
866374_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	We lease facilities with approximately 6.6 million square feet in Asia, 3.3 million square feet in the Americas and 2.2 million square feet in Europe.
866374_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also have regional manufacturing operations, generally ranging in size from under 100,000 to approximately 2.7 million square feet in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Ukraine and the United States.
866374_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also have smaller design and engineering centers and product introduction centers at a number of locations in the world's major electronics markets.
866374_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our facilities are well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted.
866374_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	The productive capacity of our plants is adequate for current needs.
866374_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
866374_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims.
866374_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	Although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management expects that any losses that are probable or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of these matters, which are in excess of amounts already accrued in its consolidated balance sheets would not be material to the financial statements as a whole.
866374_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low per share sales prices for our ordinary shares since the beginning of fiscal year 2012 as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

866374_13_ITEM5_P11_S1	As of March 31, 2013, we had 35.3 million shares available to be repurchased under the plan with an approximate dollar value of $237.6 million at an assumed average price of $6.72 per share.
866374_13_ITEM5_P12_S0	Singapore does not impose a withholding tax on dividends.
866374_13_ITEM5_P12_S1	All dividends are tax exempt to shareholders.
866374_13_ITEM5_P13_S0	Under current Singapore tax law there is no tax on capital gains, thus any profits from the disposal of shares are not taxable in Singapore unless the gains arising from the disposal of shares are income in nature and subject to tax, especially if they arise from activities which the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore regards as the carrying on of a trade or business in Singapore (in which case, the profits on the sale would be taxable as trade profits rather than capital gains).
866374_13_ITEM5_P14_S0	Shareholders who apply, or who are required to apply, the Singapore Financial Reporting Standard 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement ("FRS 39") for the purposes of Singapore income tax may be required to recognize gains or losses (not being gains or losses in the nature of capital) in accordance with the provisions of FRS 39 (as modified by the applicable provisions of Singapore income tax law) even though no sale or disposal of shares is made.
866374_13_ITEM5_P15_S0	There is no stamp duty payable for holding shares, and no duty is payable on the acquisition of newly-issued shares.
866374_13_ITEM5_P16_S0	When existing shares are acquired in Singapore, a stamp duty is payable on the instrument of transfer of the shares at the rate of two Singapore dollars ("S$") for every S$1,000 of the market value of the shares.
866374_13_ITEM5_P16_S1	The stamp duty is borne by the purchaser unless there is an agreement to the contrary.
866374_13_ITEM5_P16_S2	If the instrument of transfer is executed outside of Singapore, the stamp duty must be paid only if the instrument of transfer is received in Singapore.
866374_13_ITEM5_P17_S0	The estate duty was abolished for deaths occurring on or after February 15, 2008.
866374_13_ITEM5_P17_S1	For deaths prior to February 15, 2008 the following rules apply:
866374_13_ITEM5_P18_S0	If an individual who is not domiciled in Singapore dies on or after January 1, 2002, no estate tax is payable in Singapore on any of our shares held by the individual.
866374_13_ITEM5_P19_S0	If property passing upon the death of an individual domiciled in Singapore includes our shares, Singapore estate duty is payable to the extent that the value of the shares aggregated with any other assets subject to Singapore estate duty exceeds S$600,000.
866374_13_ITEM5_P19_S1	Unless other exemptions apply to the other assets, for example, the separate exemption limit for residential properties, any excess beyond S$600,000 will be taxed at 5% on the first S$12,000,000 of the individual's chargeable assets and thereafter at 10%.
866374_13_ITEM5_P20_S0	An individual shareholder who is a U.S. citizen or resident (for U.S. estate tax purposes) will have the value of the shares included in the individual's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes.
866374_13_ITEM5_P20_S1	An individual shareholder generally will be entitled to a tax credit against the shareholder's U.S. estate tax to the extent the individual shareholder actually pays Singapore estate tax on the value of the shares; however, such tax credit is generally limited to the percentage of the U.S. estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the value of the shares included in the shareholder's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes, adjusted further by a pro rata apportionment of available exemptions.
866374_13_ITEM5_P20_S2	Individuals who are domiciled in Singapore should consult their own tax advisors regarding the Singapore estate tax consequences of their investment.

866374_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a leading global supply chain solutions provider, offering advanced design, manufacturing and logistics and after-sales services to OEMs of a broad range of electronics products in the following markets: High Reliability Solutions ("HRS"), which is comprised of our medical, automotive, and defense and aerospace businesses; High Velocity Solutions ("HVS"), which includes our mobile devices business, including smart phones, and consumer electronics, including game consoles, high-volume computing business, including notebook personal computing ("PC"), tablets and printers; Industrial and Emerging Industries ("IEI"), which is comprised of large household appliances, equipment, and our emerging industries businesses; and Integrated Network Solutions ("INS"), which includes our telecommunications infrastructure, data networking, connected home, and server and storage businesses.
866374_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our strategy is to provide customers with a full range of cost competitive, vertically-integrated global supply chain services through which the we can design, build, ship and service a complete packaged product for our OEM customers.
866374_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	This enables our OEM customers to leverage our services to meet their product requirements throughout the entire product life cycle.
866374_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Historically, our industry experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elected to outsource some or all of their design and manufacturing requirements.
866374_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	We have seen an increase in the penetration of the global OEM manufacturing requirements since the 2001 - 2002 technology downturn as more and more OEMs pursued the benefits of outsourcing rather than internal manufacturing.
866374_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Due to the global economic crisis, which began in late calendar year 2007 and continued through the end of our fiscal year 2010, many of our OEM customers reduced their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing which negatively impacted our business.
866374_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	During our fiscal year 2011, we began seeing some positive signs that demand for our OEM customers' end products was improving, and this trend continued through the end of our 2013 fiscal year.
866374_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	However, our revenues in fiscal 2013 declined primarily as a result of our exit from the high volume and low margin ("ODM") PC business, which we fully exited by the end of fiscal 2012, and from a reduction of concentration of business with a well known smart phone OEM.
866374_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	We use a portfolio management approach to manage our extensive service offerings.
866374_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	As our OEM customers change in the way they go to market, we reorganize and rebalance our business portfolio in order to align with our customers' needs and requirements and to optimize our operating results.
866374_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	lower margin HVS businesses by exiting our ODM PC business in fiscal 2012 and assembly disengagement with a well known smart phone OEM in fiscal 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Over the past few years, we have experienced increased revenue in our more complex and higher margin business groups (HRS, IEI, and INS) together with new business opportunities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Although our recent acquisition of certain manufacturing operations from Google's Motorola Mobility LLC is expected to increase the percentage of our revenues from the HVS market in fiscal year 2014 and beyond, we do not expect the percentage of revenues from our HVS business to approach the concentration experienced in fiscal year 2011 and prior.
866374_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	The objective of our operating model is to allow us to redeploy and reposition our assets and resources to meet specific customer needs across all of the markets we serve, and we have been able to successfully reposition HVS assets and capacity to serve our customers in other business groups as required which illustrates the overall flexibility of our model.
866374_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	We are one of the world's largest manufacturing service providers, with revenues of $23.6 billion in fiscal year 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have established an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world's major electronics markets (Asia, the Americas and Europe) in order to serve the growing outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	We design, build, ship, and service electronics products for our customers through a network of facilities in over 30 countries across four continents.
866374_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	As of March 31, 2013, our total manufacturing capacity was approximately 27.6 million square feet.
866374_13_ITEM7_P7_S4	In fiscal year 2013, our net sales in Asia, the Americas and Europe represented approximately 50%, 31% and 19%, respectively, of our total net sales, based on the location of the manufacturing site.
866374_13_ITEM7_P7_S5	The following tables set forth net sales and net property and equipment, by country, based on the location of our manufacturing sites and the relative percentages:
866374_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	We believe that the combination of our extensive design and engineering services, significant scale and global presence, end-to-end services, advanced supply chain management, industrial campuses in low-cost geographic areas and operational track record provide us with a competitive advantage in the market for designing, manufacturing and servicing electronics products for leading multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	simplify their global product development, manufacturing process, and after sales services, and enable them to achieve meaningful time to market and cost savings.
866374_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including the following:
866374_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	changes in the macro-economic environment and related changes in consumer demand; the mix of the manufacturing services we are providing, the number and size of new manufacturing programs, the degree to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity, seasonal demand, shortages of components and other factors; the effects on our business when our customers are not successful in marketing their products, or when their products do not gain widespread commercial acceptance; our ability to achieve commercially viable production yields and to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our OEM customers; the effects on our business due to our customers' products having short product life cycles; our customers' ability to cancel or delay orders or change production quantities; our customers' decision to choose internal manufacturing instead of outsourcing for their product requirements; our exposure to financially troubled customers; and integration of acquired businesses and facilities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Net revenues for fiscal year 2013 decreased 19.7% or $5.8 billion to $23.6 billion.
866374_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	This decline was primarily attributable to the disengagement of our assembly activities with a well known smart phone OEM and the exit of our ODM PC business, which resulted in decreases of approximately $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our revenue deteriorated in all the major markets we serve except for HRS.
866374_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	By the end of fiscal year 2013, we continued to strive to maintain a competitive position driven in part by the success in our diversified business model.
866374_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	Our fiscal year 2013 gross profit totaled $1.2 billion, representing a decrease of $351.7 million, or 23.2%, compared to fiscal year 2012 primarily due to restructuring charges amounting to $215.8 million included in cost of sales in fiscal year 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P12_S5	Our income from continuing operations of $302.5 million was lower than the $520.8 million realized in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Cash provided by operations increased approximately $311.2 million to $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2013 compared with $804.3 million for fiscal year 2012 primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions which decreased $315.9 million in fiscal year 2013 primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory, offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other current and noncurrent liabilities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our average net working capital, defined as accounts receivable plus the deferred purchase price receivable from our asset-backed securitization programs plus inventory less accounts payable, as a percentage of annual sales was approximately 7.8%, 6.2% and 4.5% for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	The increase in the percentage for the year ended March 31, 2013 is primarily attributable to lower revenue from our HVS business as a result of our exit of our ODM PC business, which historically carries significantly higher inventory turns and customers with contractually faster payment terms, offset by lower accounts receivable, deferred purchase price receivables and inventories in fiscal year 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	Our free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment, was $680.1 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to $416.3 million for fiscal year 2012, primarily due to higher cash flows from operations partially off-set by higher capital expenditures.
866374_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $339.6 million during fiscal year 2013 and included repurchases of approximately 49.9 million ordinary shares at an aggregate purchase value of $322.0 million.
866374_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	As of March 31, 2013, $12.0 million was included in accrued expenses for approximately 1.8 million ordinary shares that were not settled in fiscal year 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Throughout fiscal year 2013, we continued to further transform our business as we exited certain non-core businesses and executed certain restructuring activities to consolidate and rationalize our global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure.
866374_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	During fiscal year 2013, we finalized the sale of two of our non-core businesses and received proceeds from these sales amounting to $22.6 million, net of $1.0 million of cash sold.
866374_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	The results of operations and financial position of the divested businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and include a $17.0 million charge in fiscal 2012 for the impairment of fixed assets and $10.0 million charge for impairment of customer-related intangible assets in fiscal 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Additionally, in response to a challenging macroeconomic environment, we initiated certain restructuring activities in fiscal 2013 intended to improve our operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce and capacity.
866374_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The restructuring activities are intended to rationalize our global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure and will result in a further shift of manufacturing capacity to locations with higher efficiencies.
866374_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2013, we recognized $227.4 million of pre-tax restructuring charges comprised of $123.0 million of cash charges predominantly related to employee severance costs and $104.4 million of non-cash charges primarily related to asset impairment and other exit charges.
866374_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	We expect to recognize an additional $40.0 million in pre-tax restructuring charges in our first quarter of fiscal 2014, comprised primarily of cash charges associated with employee termination costs to be classified as a component of cost of sales.
866374_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	We believe that our business transformation has strategically positioned us very well to take advantage of the long-term, future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities, design and engineering services and after-market services, which remain strong.
866374_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
866374_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
866374_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
866374_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	We recognize manufacturing revenue when we ship goods or the goods are received by our customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured.
866374_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Generally, there are no substantive customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services.
866374_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	If such requirements or obligations exist, then we recognize the related revenues at the time when such requirements are completed and the obligations are fulfilled.
866374_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	We make provisions for estimated sales returns and other adjustments at the time revenue is recognized based upon contractual terms and an analysis of historical returns.
866374_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	These provisions were not material to our consolidated financial statements for any of the periods presented.
866374_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	We provide a comprehensive suite of services for our customers that range from contract design services to manufacturing and logistics to repair services.
866374_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	We recognize service revenue when the services have been performed, and the related costs are expensed as incurred.
866374_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Our net sales for services were less than 10% of our total sales for all periods presented, and accordingly, are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	We have an established customer credit policy through which we manage customer credit exposures through credit evaluations, credit limit setting, monitoring, and enforcement of credit limits for new and existing customers.
866374_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and make provisions for doubtful accounts based on the outcome of those credit evaluations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances, current economic trends, and the age of past due receivables.
866374_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	To the extent we identify exposures as a result of credit or customer evaluations, we also review other customer related exposures, including but not limited to inventory and related contractual obligations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P23_S4	For example, subsequent to fiscal year 2012 and prior to issuance of our financial statements, the Company became aware that one of its customers in the concentrated solar photovoltaic market was experiencing significant financial and liquidity difficulties.
866374_13_ITEM7_P23_S5	Based on an evaluation of this customer's specific circumstances, the Company determined that its best estimate was that all accounts receivable and inventory related to this customer were unrecoverable and recorded a charge of $32.0 million as of March 31, 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	We recognize restructuring charges related to our plans to close or consolidate duplicate manufacturing and administrative facilities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	In connection with these activities, we recognize restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other exit-related costs.
866374_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	The recognition of these restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	To the extent our actual results in exiting these facilities differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Refer to note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	We review property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
866374_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of these long-lived assets exceeds their fair value.
866374_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Recoverability of property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets are measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
866374_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets exceeds fair value.
866374_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
866374_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors, market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis.
866374_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	We have one reporting unit: EMS.
866374_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	If the recorded value of the assets, including goodwill, and liabilities ("net book value") of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss may be required to be recognized.
866374_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	Further, to the extent the net book value of the Company as a whole is greater than its fair value in the aggregate, all, or a significant portion of its goodwill may be considered impaired.
866374_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value.
866374_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short-term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand.
866374_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	We purchase our inventory based on forecasted demand, and we estimate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand, and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers.
866374_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	If actual market conditions or our customers' product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional provisions may be required.
866374_13_ITEM7_P32_S4	In addition, unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers and/or changes in economic conditions may require additional write downs for inventories due to our customers' inability to fulfill their contractual obligations with regard to inventory procured to fulfill customer demand.
866374_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities which will result in deductible amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards.
866374_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	Based on estimates, the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize these deferred income tax assets.
866374_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors.
866374_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets previously recognized, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.
866374_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	Refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our tax position.
866374_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales.
866374_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The data below, and discussion that follows, represents our results from operations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	During fiscal year 2013, the Company finalized the sale of two of its non-core businesses.
866374_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Total proceeds received from these sales amounted to $22.6 million, net of $1.0 million of cash sold.
866374_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Company recognized a loss on sale of $12.1 million, which is included in interest and other expenses (income), net within the results from discontinued operations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2013 totaled $23.6 billion, representing a decrease of $5.8 billion, or 19.7%, from $29.3 billion during fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Sales during fiscal year 2013 decreased across all of the markets we serve except for HRS consisting of decreases of: (i) $5.3 billion or 46.2% in the HVS market, (ii) $0.7 billion or 6.5% in the INS market and (iii) $0.2 billion or 3.9% in the IEI market.
866374_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	The decline in sales was primarily due to a decrease in the HVS market as a result of reduction in revenues due to our disengagement from our assembly business with a well known smart phone OEM customers, which resulted in an approximately $2.2 billion reduction of sales and our exit from the ODM PC business during fiscal 2012, which resulted in an approximately $1.6 billion reduction of sales.
866374_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	The remainder of the decrease across the other markets was attributable to reduced demand during fiscal year 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P38_S4	The decrease in these markets was partially offset by increase in sales from our HRS market group amounting to $0.5 billion or 19.5%, primarily due to increased demand for our customer products in the automotive market and to a lesser extent from our acquisition of Saturn Electronics and Engineering, Inc. in December 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P38_S5	Net sales decreased across all of the geographical regions we serve, consisting of decreases of $3.7 billion in Asia, $1.2 billion in the Americas and $0.9 billion in Europe.
866374_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2012 totaled $29.3 billion, representing an increase of $0.9 billion, or 3.2%, from $28.4 billion during fiscal year 2011.
866374_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Sales during fiscal year 2012 increased across all of the markets we serve except for HVS, consisting of increases of: (i) $0.7 billion or 6.2% in the INS market, (ii) $0.5 billion or 24.2% in the HRS market, and (iii) $0.1 billion or 3.3% in the IEI market.
866374_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	The increase in sales for our INS market was driven by new program wins with existing customers with products in enterprise data networking and telecommunications infrastructure markets, offset by declining demand from certain customer programs in the server market due to the end of the product life cycles or which transitioned to another supplier.
866374_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	The increase in sales for our HRS market was driven primarily from new wins and programs with our larger customers in the automotive, medical equipment and drug delivery markets.
866374_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	customers serving the clean tech markets, offset by reduced demand from our customers serving the capital equipment markets.
866374_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	The increase in net sales for these markets was offset by a $0.4 billion or 3.0% decrease in sales in the HVS market due to a decrease in sales of mobile handsets to one of our significant customers, partially offset by an increase in sales through the first nine months of fiscal year 2012 to another significant customer in the ODM personal computing business which we exited in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	Net sales increased across all of the geographical regions we serve, consisting of increases of $0.8 billion in Asia, $0.1 billion in the Americas and an insignificant increase in Europe.
866374_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following table sets forth net sales by market and their relative percentages:
866374_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our ten largest customers during fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 accounted for approximately 47%, 55% and 52% of net sales, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	No customer accounted for greater than 10% of our net sales during fiscal year 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	During fiscal year 2012 Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Research In Motion (RIM) each accounted for greater than 10% of net sales and during fiscal year 2011, RIM accounted for greater than 10% of net sales.
866374_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Gross profit is affected by a number of factors, including the number and size of new manufacturing programs, product mix, component costs and availability, product life cycles, unit volumes, pricing, competition, new product introductions, capacity utilization and the expansion and consolidation of manufacturing facilities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	The flexible design of our manufacturing processes allows us to build a broad range of products in our facilities and better utilize our manufacturing capacity.
866374_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	In the cases of new programs, profitability normally lags revenue growth due to product start-up costs, lower manufacturing program volumes in the start-up phase, operational inefficiencies, and under-absorbed overhead.
866374_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Gross margin for these programs often improves over time as manufacturing volumes increase, as our utilization rates and overhead absorption improve, and as we increase the level of manufacturing services content.
866374_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	As a result of these various factors, our gross margin varies from period to period.
866374_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Gross profit during fiscal year 2013 decreased $351.7 million to $1.2 billion from $1.5 billion during fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Gross margin decreased to 4.9% of net sales in fiscal year 2013 as compared with 5.2% of net sales in fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	Gross margins deteriorated 30 basis points in fiscal year 2013 compared to that of fiscal year 2012 primarily due to restructuring charges amounting to $215.8 million, or 90 basis points, included in cost of sales.
866374_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	The impact of the restructuring charges was partially offset by lower sales from our HVS market which generally carry lower margins than the overall margins on our other complex business groups, and the $23.9 million accounting correction recognized in fiscal 2012 as discussed below.
866374_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Gross profit during fiscal year 2012 decreased $65.4 million to $1.5 billion from $1.6 billion during fiscal year 2011.
866374_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Gross margin decreased to 5.2% of net sales in fiscal year 2012 as compared with 5.6% of net sales in fiscal year 2011.
866374_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	products in the ODM personal computing business during the first nine months of fiscal year 2012, which are included in the HVS market which we exited in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	These businesses sustained gross losses of approximately $38.2 million in fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Fiscal year 2012 cost of sales also includes the impact of adjustments made to correct certain accounting errors identified and recorded as out of period adjustments during the fourth quarter of fiscal year.
866374_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	These out-of period adjustments amounted to approximately $23.9 million and resulted in increased cost of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	In addition, gross margins were negatively impacted by unfavorable manufacturing costs associated with the exit of our ODM related businesses and costs incurred for right-sizing activities at various locations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	In response to a challenging macroeconomic environment, we initiated certain restructuring activities to improve our operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce and capacity.
866374_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	The restructuring activities are intended to rationalize our global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure and further shift manufacturing capacity to locations with higher efficiencies.
866374_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	During fiscal year 2013, we recognized $227.4 million of pre-tax restructuring charges comprised of $123.0 million of cash charges predominantly related to employee severance costs and $104.4 million of non-cash charges primarily related asset impairment and other exit charges.
866374_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	The restructuring charges by geographic region amounted to $108.4 million in Asia, $91.8 million in Europe and $27.2 million in the Americas.
866374_13_ITEM7_P50_S4	We classified $215.8 million of these charges as a component of cost of sales and $11.6 million of these charges as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal year 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P50_S5	As of March 31, 2013, accrued costs related to restructuring charges incurred were $97.9 million, of which $87.8 million was classified as a current obligation.
866374_13_ITEM7_P50_S6	We do not anticipate a significant change to our previously announced restructuring plan and expect to recognize an additional $40.0 million in pre-tax restructuring charges in our first quarter of fiscal 2014, comprised primarily of cash charges associated with employee termination costs to be classified as a component of cost of sales.
866374_13_ITEM7_P50_S7	We expect these restructuring activities will allow for potential savings through reduced employee expenses and lower operating costs and to yield annualized cost reductions of approximately $150.0 million.
866374_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Refer to note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") totaled $805.2 million or 3.4% of net sales, during fiscal year 2013, compared to $877.6 million, or 3.0% of net sales, during fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	The decrease in SG A in dollars was primarily attributable to the elimination of costs relating to our ODM PC business which we fully exited during fiscal year 2012 and a $28 million provision for doubtful accounts recorded in fiscal 2012 related to a customer concentrated in the solar photovoltaic market that incurred significant financial and liquidity difficulties, The increase of SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to lower revenues.
866374_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG A, totaled $877.6 million or 3.0% of net sales, during fiscal year 2012, compared to $801.8 million, or 2.8% of net sales, during fiscal year 2011.
866374_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increases in SG A in dollars and as a percentage of net sales were primarily attributable to the $28.0 million provision for doubtful accounts we recognized in connection with the financially distressed customer discussed above and certain other costs associated with the exit of our ODM related businesses during the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal year 2013 decreased by $20.1 million to $29.5 million from $49.6 million in fiscal year 2012 and decreased by $16.6 million in fiscal 2012 from $66.2 million in fiscal 2011.
866374_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	The decrease for both periods was primarily due to the use of the accelerated method of amortization for certain customer-related intangibles, which results in decreasing expense over time.
866374_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	During fiscal year 2013, we recognized other income of $65.2 million primarily due to a gain from the fair value adjustment of $74.4 million of our warrants to purchase common shares of a supplier.
866374_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	These fully-vested warrants, which are derivative instruments, are to be fair valued at each reporting date with gains or losses from changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	The gain is offset by various losses from sale, or direct impairments of certain non-core equity investments and notes receivable, and losses from sales of international entities that are individually immaterial.
866374_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	During fiscal year 2012, we recognized a net gain of $20.0 million, in connection with the sale of certain international entities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	During fiscal year 2011, we recognized charges totaling $6.3 million, consisting of a $13.2 million loss associated with the early redemption of our 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes, and an $11.7 million loss in connection with the divestiture of certain international entities, offset by a gain of $18.6 million associated with the sale of an equity investment that was previously fully impaired.
866374_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Interest and other expense, net was $56.3 million during fiscal year 2013, compared to $36.0 million during fiscal year 2012, an increase of $20.3 million that was primarily due to a decrease in gains on foreign exchange transactions.
866374_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	The decrease in gains on foreign exchange transactions is attributable to our cross-border foreign currency transactions and the revaluation of RMB denominated net asset positions of our U.S. dollar functional currency sites based in China.
866374_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	There can be no assurance that further gains from various arbitrage opportunities related to foreign exchange settlements in China will be available in the future.
866374_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Interest and other expense, net was $36.0 million during fiscal year 2012, compared to $74.9 million during fiscal year 2011, a decrease of $38.9 million.
866374_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	The decrease in net expense was primarily due to a $39.2 million reduction in net interest expense principally from the expiration of interest rate swaps in January 2011, which had fixed rates greater than the floating rates underlying our borrowing arrangements and to a lesser extent to the refinancing of $542.1 million of certain subordinated notes during fiscal year 2011 with our lower rate revolving credit facility and Asia term loans.
866374_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	Gains on foreign exchange transactions increased $6.6 million during fiscal year 2012 as we continue to benefit from certain arbitrage opportunities related to foreign currency transactions and the revaluation of RMB denominated net asset positions for our U.S. functional currency sites based in China.
866374_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	We expect interest expense to increase during fiscal year 2014 as a result of our $1.0 billion of fixed rate debt issued in February 2013, which comprises $500 million of 4.625% notes and $500 million of 5.000% notes.
866374_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Although these interest rates are fixed, such interest rates are higher than the interest rate of the variable rate debt that was repaid in February 2013, which bore a base rate plus a margin of 1.25% or LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%.
866374_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates.
866374_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	The consolidated effective tax rates were 8.0%, 9.4% and 3.5% for the fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011.
866374_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	The effective rate varies from the Singapore statutory rate of 17.0% as a result of recognition of earnings in different jurisdictions, operating loss carry forwards, income tax credits, previously established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, liabilities for uncertain tax positions, as well as because of the effect of certain tax holidays and incentives granted to our subsidiaries primarily in China, Malaysia, Israel, and Singapore.
866374_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	We generate most of our revenues and profits from operations outside of Singapore.
866374_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 varies from the effective rates for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 primarily as a result of changes in valuation allowances and liabilities for uncertain tax positions.
866374_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	See note 11, "Income Taxes," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion.
866374_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Consistent with our strategy to evaluate the strategic and financial contributions of each of our operations and to focus on the primary growth objectives in our core manufacturing business activities, in fiscal year 2013, we finalized the sale of two of our non-core businesses.
866374_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	These non-core businesses represent separate asset groups and the divestitures qualify as discontinued operations, and accordingly, we have reported the results of operations and financial position of these businesses in discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.
866374_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	The results from discontinued operations were as follows:
866374_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	Net sales in fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2012 decreased $86.7 million and $110.0 million, respectively, as we decelerated operations while evaluating strategic alternatives for the businesses and due to the end of certain product life cycles.
866374_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	The increase in net loss during fiscal year 2012 is primarily attributable to a $17.0 million charge for impairment of fixed assets that were sold in the transaction.
866374_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	The impairment charge is included in cost of sales in the results of discontinued operations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P69_S3	We recognized a loss of $12.1 million as a result of the disposition of these non-core businesses in fiscal 2013 which is included in interest and other expense (income), net in the results from discontinued operations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	As of March 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion and bank and other borrowings of $2.1 billion.
866374_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	We have a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2013 and $140 million outstanding as of March 31, 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world.
866374_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	As of March 31, 2013, approximately half of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries outside of Singapore.
866374_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	Although substantially all of the amounts held outside of Singapore could be repatriated, under current laws, a significant amount could be subject to income tax withholdings.
866374_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	We provide for tax liabilities on these amounts for financial statement purposes, except for certain of our foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Singapore (approximately $457.7 million as of March 31, 2013).
866374_13_ITEM7_P71_S4	Repatriation could result in an additional income tax payment, however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of Singapore and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our operations in jurisdictions outside of where they are held.
866374_13_ITEM7_P71_S5	Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of Singapore and we would meet our liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both.
866374_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion during fiscal year 2013, which resulted primarily from $277.1 million of net income for the period and $522.5 million of non-cash earnings adjustment items such as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation expense.
866374_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	We generated $315.9 million in cash as a result of decreases in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions.
866374_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	Our changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions is primarily due to a decrease of $519.1 million in accounts receivable and decrease of $596.1 million in inventory, which was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $671.4 million and a decrease in other current and noncurrent liabilities of $189.5 million.
866374_13_ITEM7_P72_S3	The decreases in accounts receivable and inventory are primarily as a result of the decrease in sales in our HVS business, which generally carry higher volumes than our other complex business groups.
866374_13_ITEM7_P72_S4	The decrease in accounts payable is principally related to the decrease in inventory and timing of supplier payments.
866374_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2013 was $697.2 million.
866374_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	This resulted primarily from $435.3 million in capital expenditures for equipment, net of proceeds on sales, and $184.1 million paid for the acquisition of four businesses during the fiscal year.
866374_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	We also spent approximately $115.3 million included in other investing cash flows, offset by the receipt of cash included in other financing activities further discussed below to purchase assets financed by a third party banking institution on behalf of a customer.
866374_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $339.6 million during fiscal year 2013, which was primarily attributable to the repurchase of approximately 49.9 million shares for an aggregate purchase value of approximately $322.0 million and repayment of the outstanding balance under our revolving line of credit of $140.0 million.
866374_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	These cash outflows were offset by the receipt of $101.9 million included in other financing activities to purchase assets financed by a third party banking institution on behalf of a customer.
866374_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Cash provided by operating activities was $804.3 million during fiscal year 2012, which resulted primarily from $488.8 million of net income for the period and $566.1 million of non-cash earnings adjustment items such as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation expense.
866374_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	We used $250.6 million in cash as a result of an increase in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions.
866374_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	accounts payable and an increase of $30.2 million in accounts receivable, which was partially offset by a decrease in inventory of $301.1 million principally due to the deceleration of sales in our HVS market, and an increase in deferred revenue and customer working capital advances of $249.8 million.
866374_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	The decrease in accounts payable is principally related to the decrease in inventory and timing of supplier payments.
866374_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	Cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2012 was $481.4 million.
866374_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	This resulted primarily from $388.0 million in capital expenditures for equipment, net of proceeds on sales, and $92.3 million paid for three acquisitions completed during the year.
866374_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $522.2 million during fiscal year 2012, which was primarily attributable to the repurchase of approximately 81.7 million shares for an aggregate purchase value of approximately $509.8 million.
866374_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	During fiscal year 2012 we also repaid $20.0 million of debt outstanding on our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility.
866374_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	Cash provided by operating activities was $857.3 million during fiscal year 2011, which resulted primarily from $596.2 million of net income for the period and $482.6 million of non-cash earnings adjustment items such as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, and stock-based compensation expense.
866374_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	We used $221.5 million in cash as a result of an increase in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions.
866374_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	Our working capital accounts increased primarily due to an increase of $664.7 million in inventories as a result of our increased production and anticipated growth, and an increase of $337.1 million in other current and non-current assets primarily attributable to $324.6 million in our deferred purchase price receivable associated with our receivables sales, which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $609.9 million and other current liabilities of $144.0 million, primarily driven by the timing of purchases and cash payments.
866374_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2011 was $413.2 million.
866374_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	This resulted primarily from $393.9 million in capital expenditures for equipment, net of proceeds on sales, and $17.0 million, net of cash acquired, for contingent consideration and deferred purchase price payments related to four acquisitions, and payments related to two completed acquisitions.
866374_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	Cash used was partially offset by proceeds related to the sale of an equity investment for $18.6 million.
866374_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $641.7 million during fiscal year 2011.
866374_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	During the 2011 fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 65.4 million shares at an aggregate purchase value of $400.4 million, including accrued expenses.
866374_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	In August 2010, we paid $240.0 million to redeem the entire principal amount of the 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes at par plus accrued interest.
866374_13_ITEM7_P81_S3	In December 2010, we paid approximately $308.5 million to redeem the aggregate principal balance and redemption premium of our 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes ("6.25% Notes") plus accrued interest.
866374_13_ITEM7_P81_S4	In addition, we made repayments of approximately $217.1 million related to our Global Asset-Backed Securitization program effective with the adoption of new accounting standards on April 1, 2010.
866374_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The cash used in financing activities was partially offset by $379.0 million of additional borrowings under new Asia term loan agreements and $160.0 million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit.
866374_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	During September 2010, we entered into two new three-year term loan agreements with certain financial institutions based in Asia and borrowed $180.0 million in the aggregate.
866374_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	During February 2011, we entered into a new three-year term loan agreement with a financial institution based in Asia and borrowed $200.0 million in the aggregate.
866374_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions, repurchase company shares and for certain other activities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	Our free cash flow, which is calculated as cash provided by operations less net purchases of property and equipment, was $680.1 million, $416.3 million and $463.5 million for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.
866374_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	Free cash flows reconcile to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of cash flows from operations as follows:
866374_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	Days in trade accounts receivable was calculated as the average accounts receivable for the current and prior quarter, excluding the reduction in accounts receivable resulting from non-cash accounts receivable sales, divided by annualized sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, days in trade accounts receivable increased by 1 day to 46 days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 primarily as a result of the decline in sales in the HVS market that contained shorter payment terms.
866374_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	Non-cash accounts receivable sales or deferred purchase price receivables included for the purposes of the calculation were $412.4 million, $514.9 million and $460.0 million for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	Deferred purchase price receivables were recorded in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
866374_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	Days in inventory was calculated as the average inventory for the current and prior quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, days in inventory remained consistent at 52 days as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	Our inventory turns were over the past two years negatively impacted by the decline in sales in the HVS market which carry significantly higher inventory turns than our corporate average inventory turns.
866374_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	Days in accounts payable was calculated as the average accounts payable for the current and prior quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	March 31, 2013, days in accounts payable improved 2 days to 72 days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 primarily due to timing of supplier payments.
866374_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Our cash conversion cycle was calculated as days in trade receivables plus days in inventory, minus days in accounts payable and is a measure of how efficient we are at managing our working capital.
866374_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, our cash conversion cycle improved 1 day to 26 days as compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 due to the factors affecting each of the components in the calculation discussed above.
866374_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets.
866374_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world.
866374_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances; however, any current restrictions are not material.
866374_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout the global organization.
866374_13_ITEM7_P91_S3	We believe that our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months.
866374_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, the timing of capital expenditures for new equipment, the extent to which we utilize operating leases for new facilities and equipment, and the levels of shipments and changes in the volumes of customer orders.
866374_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Historically, we have funded operations from cash and cash equivalents generated from operations, proceeds from public offerings of equity and debt securities, bank debt and lease financings.
866374_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	We also sell designated pools of trade receivables under asset-backed securitization ("ABS") programs and sell certain trade receivables, which are in addition to the trade receivables sold in connection with these securitization agreements.
866374_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	During fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 we received approximately $3.5 billion, $4.7 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively from sales of receivables under our ABS programs, and $1.1 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively from other sales of receivables.
866374_13_ITEM7_P93_S3	As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, the outstanding balance on receivables sold for cash was $720.5 million and $667.3 million, respectively, under all our accounts receivable sales programs, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets.
866374_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	On February 20, 2013, the Company issued $500.0 million of 4.625% Notes due February 15, 2020 and $500.0 million of 5.000% Notes due February 15, 2023 (collectively the "Notes") in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act.
866374_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	The Company received net proceeds of approximately $990.6 million from the issuance and used those proceeds together with $9.4 million of cash on hand, to repay $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under its 2007 term loan facility.
866374_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	This refinancing extended the maturity and effectively converted $1.0 billion of the Company's floating rate debt to a fixed rate.
866374_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	We anticipate that we will enter into debt and equity financings, sales of accounts receivable and lease transactions to fund acquisitions and anticipated growth.
866374_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	The sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current shareholders.
866374_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	Further, we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations and could increase debt service obligations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P96_S2	This increased indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, potentially affect our credit ratings, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_13_ITEM7_P96_S3	Any downgrades in credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow as a result of more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_13_ITEM7_P96_S4	We continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase ordinary shares.
866374_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	On September 13, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10% of our outstanding ordinary shares which was approved by our shareholders at the 2012 Extraordinary General Meeting held on August 30, 2012.
866374_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	Share repurchases by us under the share repurchase plans are subject to an aggregate limit of 10% of our ordinary shares outstanding as of the date of the 2012 Extraordinary General Meeting.
866374_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	During fiscal year 2013, we repurchased approximately 31.3 million shares for an aggregate purchase value of approximately $200.0 million under this plan, including accrued expenses, and retired all of these shares.
866374_13_ITEM7_P97_S3	During the first fiscal quarter of 2013, we repurchased the entire remaining amount under the plan that was approved by our Board of Directors on December 7, 2011, or approximately 20.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase value of approximately $134.0 million, and retired all of these shares.
866374_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	As discussed above, during fiscal 2013, the Company issued an aggregate amount of $1.0 billion in Notes which are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, rank equally with all of the Company's other existing and future senior and unsecured debt obligations, and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally on an unsecured basis, by each of the Company's 100% owned subsidiaries that guarantees indebtedness under, or is a borrower under, the Company's Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Line of Credit.
866374_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	These notes carry registration rights and we have an obligation to register these securities by November 17, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P98_S2	As of March 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the covenants under these credit facilities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P98_S3	Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually, commencing on August 15, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	The Company also has a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility consisting of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $500 million term loan, which expires in October 2016.
866374_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	As of March 31, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
866374_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	The credit facility requires that we maintain a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined.
866374_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	As of March 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the covenants under the credit facility.
866374_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	We have approximately $687.8 million of borrowings outstanding under two term loan facilities as of March 31, 2013, including the Term Loan discussed above.
866374_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	Of these amounts, approximately $170.3 million matures in October 2014, and the remainder matures in October 2016.
866374_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	We do not need to make any payments on the term loan facility that matures in October 2014 and any payments thereafter through maturity are not significant.
866374_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	The term loan which matures in October 2016 is repayable in quarterly installments of $6.9 million through September 2013 and $10.3 million per quarter thereafter, with the remaining amount due at maturity.
866374_13_ITEM7_P101_S4	Both of these term loan facilities require that we maintain a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, and as of March 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the covenant.
866374_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	We also have approximately $375 million of borrowings outstanding under our Asia term loans as of March 31, 2013 which mature in September 2013 and February 2014.
866374_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	Quarterly repayments for these loans are not significant.
866374_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	These loans also require the Company maintain a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA during the terms of the agreements.
866374_13_ITEM7_P102_S3	As of March 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with the covenant.
866374_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	We and certain of our subsidiaries also have various uncommitted revolving credit facilities, lines of credit and other loans in the amount of $274.2 million in the aggregate under which there were no borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	Refer to the discussion in note 6, "Bank Borrowings and Long-Term Debt" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of the Company's debt obligations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	We have purchase obligations that arise in the normal course of business, primarily consisting of binding purchase orders for inventory related items and capital expenditures.
866374_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	Additionally, we have leased certain of our property and equipment under capital lease commitments, and certain of our facilities and equipment under operating lease commitments.
866374_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	Future payments due under our purchase obligations, debt including capital leases and related interest obligations and operating lease contracts are as follows:
866374_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Interest on the credit facility that matures in October 2016, under which, as of March 31, 2013, we had $517.5 million outstanding under our term loan and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, is based at our option on, either at (i) LIBOR plus the applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranging between 1.25% and 2.25%, based on the Company's credit ratings or (ii) the base rate (the greatest of the agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin ranging between 0.25% and 1.25%, based on the Company's credit rating.
866374_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	Interest on the $375 million outstanding under our Asia term loans accrues at LIBOR plus 2.15% to 2.30%.
866374_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	Interest on the $170.3 million outstanding under our term loan facility that matures in October 2014 is based at our option on either (i) the base rate (the greater of the agent's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus a margin of 1.25%; or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%.
866374_13_ITEM7_P107_S3	Finally, our variable rate debt also includes demand notes and certain variable lines of credit.
866374_13_ITEM7_P107_S4	These credit lines are located throughout the world and variable interest is generally based on a spread over that country's inter-bank offering rate.
866374_13_ITEM7_P107_S5	Interest expense in the table above is estimated based on LIBOR for the applicable tenor as of March 31, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	We have excluded $230.0 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from the contractual obligations table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the periodic settlements with the respective taxing authorities.
866374_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	See note 11, "Income Taxes" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details.
866374_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements.
866374_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	We intend to use our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations to fund our existing and future contractual obligations.
866374_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	We sell designated pools of trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions under our ABS programs, and in addition to cash, we receive a deferred purchase price receivable for each pool of the receivables sold.
866374_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	Each of these deferred purchase price receivables serves as additional credit support to the financial institutions and is recorded at its estimated fair value.
866374_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	the fair value of our deferred purchase price receivable was approximately $412.4 million and $514.9 million, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, the outstanding balance on receivables sold for cash was $720.5 million and $667.3 million, respectively, under all our accounts receivable sales programs, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets.
866374_13_ITEM7_P111_S2	For further information see note 8 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	Refer to note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have warrants to purchase common shares of a certain supplier, which create exposures for us related to market price volatility.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We value these warrants using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	For the three-months ended March 31, 2013, we used the following assumptions to value these warrants:
866374_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	These warrants were exercised and the underlying shares were sold subsequent to year end for total proceeds of $67.3 million resulting in a $7.1 million realized loss from the recorded value of $74.4 million as of March 31, 2013, that will be recognized during the Company's fiscal quarter ending June 28, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio, which consists of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from original dates of purchase.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to 20% of the issuer's or fund's total assets measured at the time of purchase or $10.0 million, whichever is greater.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	We protect our invested principal by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P2_S4	We mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities and by constantly positioning the portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P2_S5	The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Maturities of short-term investments are timed, whenever possible, to correspond with debt payments and capital investments.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As of March 31, 2013, the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was $0.5 billion, comprised mainly of money market funds with an average return of 3.1%.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We had variable rate debt outstanding of approximately $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Variable rate debt obligations consisted of borrowings under our term loan.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Interest on these obligations is discussed above.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Our variable rate debt instruments create exposures for us related to interest rate risk.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Primarily due to the current low interest rates a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year primarily due to the current low interest rates.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	As of March 31, 2013, the approximate fair value of our debt outstanding under our term loan facility that matures in October 2014 was 100.1% of the face value of the debt obligation, and the fair value of debt outstanding under our term loan that matures in October 2016 was 100.3% of the face value of the debt obligation, based on broker trading prices.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Our Asia term loans are not traded publicly; however, as the pricing, maturity and other pertinent terms of these loans closely approximate those of the term loan facilities described above, we estimate the respective fair values would be approximately the same as the carrying values of the respective term loan facilities.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	We have established a foreign currency risk management policy to manage this risk.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P8_S2	To the extent possible, we manage our foreign currency exposure by evaluating and using non-financial techniques, such as currency of invoice, leading and lagging payments and receivables management.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P8_S3	In addition, we borrow in various foreign currencies and enter into short-term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities, mainly accounts receivable and accounts payable, and cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We endeavor to maintain a partial or fully hedged position for certain transaction exposures.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P9_S1	These exposures are primarily, but not limited to, revenues, customer and vendor payments and inter-company balances in currencies other than the functional currency unit of the operating entity.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The credit risk of our foreign currency forward and swap contracts is minimized since all contracts are with large financial institutions and accordingly, fair value adjustments related to the credit risk of the counter-party financial institution were not material.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The gains and losses on forward and swap contracts generally offset the losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and transactions hedged.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The fair value of currency forward and swap contracts is reported on the balance sheet.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts as of March 31, 2013 amounted to $4.8 billion and the recorded fair values of the associated asset and/or liability were not material.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The majority of these foreign exchange contracts expire in less than three months and all expire within one year.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P11_S1	They will settle primarily in Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, China renminbi, Danish kroner, Euro, Hungarian forint, Israeli shekel, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, and U.S. dollar.
866374_13_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Based on our overall currency rate exposures as of March 31, 2013, including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and cash flows, a near-term 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar from its cross-functional rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.

866374_13_ITEM8_P74_S3	Options granted to non-employee directors expire five years from the date of grant.
866374_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	The exercise price of options granted to employees is determined by the Company's Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and may not be less than the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant.
866374_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	The Company also grants share bonus awards under its equity compensation plan.
866374_13_ITEM8_P76_S1	Share bonus awards are rights to acquire a specified number of ordinary shares for no cash consideration in exchange for continued service with the Company.

866374_13_ITEM8_P76_S3	Vesting for certain share bonus awards is contingent upon both service and market conditions.
866374_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense:
866374_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	As required by the authoritative guidance for stock-based compensation, management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.
866374_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary termination behavior as well as an analysis of actual forfeitures.
866374_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	As of March 31, 2013, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share options granted to employees under the Company's equity compensation plans was approximately $1.9 million, net of estimated forfeitures.
866374_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years and will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	As of March 31, 2013, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share bonus awards granted to employees was approximately $71.4 million, net of estimated forfeitures.
866374_13_ITEM8_P80_S3	This cost will be amortized generally on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years and will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_13_ITEM8_P80_S4	Approximately $8.0 million of the unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, is related to share bonus awards granted to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting a certain market condition.

866374_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	During fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company did not recognize any excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow.
866374_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share options granted using the Black-Scholes valuation method and a single option award approach.
866374_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
866374_13_ITEM8_P82_S2	The fair market value of share bonus awards granted, other than those awards with a market condition, is the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant and is generally recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.
866374_13_ITEM8_P82_S3	For share bonus awards whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions, the fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation.
866374_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	Expected Term The Company's expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation method represents the period that the Company's share options are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share options, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its share options.
866374_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	Expected Volatility The Company's expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes valuation method is derived from a combination of implied volatility related to publicly traded options to purchase Flextronics ordinary shares and historical variability in the Company's periodic share price.
866374_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	Expected Dividend The Company has never paid dividends on its ordinary shares and currently does not intend to do so in the near term, and accordingly, the dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.
866374_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities issued with a term equivalent to the expected term of the option.
866374_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	The fair value of the Company's share options granted to employees for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 other than those with market criteria discussed below, was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	Options granted during the 2013, 2012 and 2011 fiscal years had contractual lives of seven years.
866374_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following is a summary of option activity for the Company's equity compensation plans, ("Price" reflects the weighted-average exercise price):
866374_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised (calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying award and the price of the Company's ordinary shares determined as of the time of option exercise for options exercised in-the-money) under the Company's equity compensation plans was $13.0 million, $17.1 million and $22.9 million during fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	Cash received from option exercises was $22.3 million, $23.1 million and $23.3 million for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	The following table presents the composition of options outstanding and exercisable as of March 31, 2013:
866374_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	$46.2 million, $46.2 million and $46.1 million, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company's ordinary shares as of March 31, 2013 for the approximately 15.2 million options that were in-the-money at March 31, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	As of March 31, 2013, the weighted average remaining contractual life for options exercisable was 2.47 years.
866374_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's share bonus award activity ("Price" reflects the weighted-average grant-date fair value):
866374_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	Of the 21.8 million unvested share bonus awards outstanding as of the year ended March 31, 2013, approximately 3.9 million represents the target amount of grants made to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting a certain market condition.
866374_13_ITEM8_P96_S1	The number of shares that ultimately will vest are based on a measurement of Flextronics' total shareholder return against the Standard and Poor's ("S P") 500 Composite Index and will vest over a period of three years.
866374_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	Of the 3.9 million awards that were outstanding as of the year ended March 31, 2013, 2.1 million were granted in fiscal year 2013 at an estimated average grant-date fair value of $7.63 per share, 1.0 million were granted in fiscal year 2012 at an average grant-date fair value of $7.78 per share, and 0.8 million were granted in fiscal year 2011 at an average grant-date fair value of $7.32 per share.
866374_13_ITEM8_P97_S1	In accordance with accounting guidance, the Company will continue to recognize share-based compensation expense for these awards with market conditions regardless of whether such awards will ultimately vest.
866374_13_ITEM8_P97_S2	The actual number of shares to be issued can range from zero to 4.1 million for the 2013 grants, zero to 1.6 million for the 2012 grants, and zero to 1.2 million for the 2011 grants.
866374_13_ITEM8_P97_S3	The awards granted during fiscal year 2011 will expire in June 2013, and are not expected to vest.
866374_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	The total intrinsic value of share bonus awards vested under the Company's equity compensation plans was $9.7 million, $17.7 million and $19.6 million during fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, based on the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date vested.
866374_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	Basic earnings per share for both continuing and discontinued operations exclude dilution and are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the applicable periods.
866374_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	Diluted earnings per share for both continuing and discontinued operations reflect the potential dilution from stock options, share bonus awards and convertible securities.
866374_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	The potential dilution from stock options exercisable into ordinary share equivalents and share bonus awards was computed using the treasury stock method based on the average fair market value of the Company's ordinary shares for the period.
866374_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	The potential dilution from the conversion spread (excess of conversion value over face value) of the Subordinated Notes convertible into ordinary share equivalents was calculated as the quotient of the conversion spread and the average fair market value of the Company's ordinary shares for the period.
866374_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	The following table reflects the basic weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding and diluted weighted-average ordinary share equivalents used to calculate basic and diluted income from continuing and discontinued operations per share:
866374_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	(1) Options to purchase ordinary shares of 20.6 million, 24.2 million and 25.5 million during fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share primarily because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market price of the Company's ordinary shares during the respective periods.
866374_13_ITEM8_P103_S1	(2) On August 2, 2010 the Company paid approximately $240.0 million to redeem its 1% Convertible Subordinated Notes upon maturity.
866374_13_ITEM8_P103_S2	The notes carried conversion provisions to issue shares to settle any conversion spread (excess of the conversion value over the conversion price) in stock.
866374_13_ITEM8_P103_S3	The conversion price was $15.525 per share (subject to certain adjustments).
866374_13_ITEM8_P103_S4	On the maturity date, the Company's stock price was less than the conversion spread, and therefore no shares were issued.
866374_13_ITEM8_P103_S5	For the year ended March 31, 2011, the conversion obligation was less than the principal portion of these notes and accordingly, no additional shares were included as ordinary share equivalents.
866374_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	The following table represents supplemental cash flow disclosures and non-cash investing and financing activities:
866374_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	Bank borrowings and long-term debt are as follows:

866374_13_ITEM8_P131_S3	The Company enters into short-term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities, primarily accounts receivable and accounts payable, and cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_13_ITEM8_P131_S4	Gains and losses on the Company's forward and swap contracts are designed to offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and transactions hedged, and accordingly, generally do not subject the Company to risk of significant accounting losses.
866374_13_ITEM8_P131_S5	The Company hedges committed exposures and does not engage in speculative transactions.
866374_13_ITEM8_P131_S6	The credit risk of these forward and swap contracts is minimized since the contracts are with large financial institutions and accordingly, fair value adjustments related to the credit risk of the counter-party financial institution were not material.

866374_13_ITEM8_P133_S1	Certain of these contracts are designed to economically hedge the Company's exposure to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and are not accounted for as hedges under the accounting standards.
866374_13_ITEM8_P133_S2	Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change as a component of interest and other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_13_ITEM8_P133_S3	As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company also has included net deferred gains and losses, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets, relating to changes in fair value of its foreign currency contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
866374_13_ITEM8_P133_S4	These deferred gains and losses were not material, and any deferred losses as of March 31, 2013 are expected to be recognized as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations primarily over the next twelve month period.
866374_13_ITEM8_P133_S5	The gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness were not material for all fiscal years presented and are included as a component of interest and other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

866374_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	affiliated special purpose entities, each of which in turn sells 100% of the receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions.
866374_13_ITEM8_P136_S1	These programs allow the operating subsidiaries to receive a cash payment and a deferred purchase price receivable for sold receivables.
866374_13_ITEM8_P136_S2	Following the transfer of the receivables to the special purpose entities, the transferred receivables are isolated from the Company and its affiliates, and upon the sale of the receivables from the special purpose entity to the unaffiliated financial institutions effective control of the transferred receivables is passed to the unaffiliated financial institutions, which has the right to pledge or sell the receivables.
866374_13_ITEM8_P136_S3	Although the special purpose entities are consolidated by the Company, they are separate corporate entities and their assets are available first to satisfy the claims of their creditors.
866374_13_ITEM8_P136_S4	The investment limits by the financial institutions are $500.0 million for the Global Program and $300.0 million for the North American Program and require a minimum level of deferred purchase price receivable to be retained by the Company in connection with the sales.

866374_13_ITEM8_P137_S2	As the Company estimates the fee it receives in return for its obligation to service these receivables is at fair value, no servicing assets and liabilities are recognized.
866374_13_ITEM8_P138_S0	Effective April 1, 2010, the Company adopted two new accounting standards, the first of which removed the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and created more stringent conditions for reporting the transfer of a financial asset as a sale.
866374_13_ITEM8_P138_S1	The second standard amended the consolidation guidance for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.
866374_13_ITEM8_P138_S2	As a result of the adoption of the second standard, the Company was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the special purpose entity to which the pool of trade receivables was sold under the Global Program and, as such, was required to consolidate the special purpose entity; the Company had previously been consolidating the special purpose entity under the North American Program.
866374_13_ITEM8_P138_S3	The North American Program was amended effective April 1, 2010 and the Global Program was amended effective September 29, 2010 in each case to provide for the sale by the special purpose entities of 100% of the eligible receivables to the unaffiliated financial institutions; previously the special purpose entities had retained a partial interest in the sold receivables.
866374_13_ITEM8_P138_S4	Upon adoption of these standards, the balance of receivables sold for cash under the Global Program as of April 1, 2010, totaling $217.1 million, was recorded as accounts receivable and short-term bank borrowings in the opening balance sheet of fiscal year 2011.
866374_13_ITEM8_P138_S5	Upon collection of these receivables the Company recorded cash from operations offset by repayments of bank borrowings from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows during the year ended March 31, 2011.
866374_13_ITEM8_P138_S6	As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, the accounts receivable balances that were sold under the ABS Programs were removed from the consolidated balance sheets and the net cash proceeds received by the Company were included as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
866374_13_ITEM8_P139_S0	Although the Company still consolidates the special purpose entities, as a result of the amendments to the North American Program effective April 1, 2010 and the Global Program on September 29, 2010, all of the receivables sold to the unaffiliated financial institutions for cash are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the cash received is no longer accounted for as a secured borrowing.

866374_13_ITEM8_P141_S0	The deferred purchase price receivable represents a beneficial interest in the transferred financial assets and is recognized at fair value as part of the sale transaction.
866374_13_ITEM8_P142_S0	As of March 31, 2013, approximately $1.0 billion of accounts receivable had been sold to the special purpose entities under the ABS Programs for which the Company had received net cash proceeds of $556.9 million and deferred purchase price receivables of $412.4 million.
866374_13_ITEM8_P142_S1	As of March 31, 2012, approximately $1.1 billion of accounts receivable had been sold to the special purpose entities for which the Company had received net cash proceeds of $556.8 million and deferred purchase price receivables of $514.9 million.

866374_13_ITEM8_P142_S3	The difference between the carrying amount of the receivables sold under these programs and the sum of the cash and fair value of the deferred purchase price receivables received at time of transfer is recognized as a loss on sale of the related receivables and recorded in interest and other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations; such amounts were $7.2 million, $10.9 million and $8.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM8_P143_S0	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, cash flows from sales of receivables under the ABS Programs consisted of approximately $3.5 billion, $4.7 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively for transfers of receivables (of which approximately $0.7 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively represented new transfers and the remainder proceeds from collections reinvested in revolving-period transfers).

866374_13_ITEM8_P145_S3	The receivables that were sold were removed from the consolidated balance sheets and were reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
866374_13_ITEM8_P146_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
866374_13_ITEM8_P146_S1	When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact, and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
866374_13_ITEM8_P147_S0	The accounting guidance for fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.
866374_13_ITEM8_P147_S1	A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
866374_13_ITEM8_P147_S2	The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
866374_13_ITEM8_P148_S0	Level 1 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
866374_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	The Company has deferred compensation plans for its officers and certain other employees.
866374_13_ITEM8_P149_S1	Deferred amounts under the plans are invested in hypothetical investments selected by the participant or the participant's investment manager.
866374_13_ITEM8_P149_S2	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets are included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets and include investments in equity securities and mutual funds that are valued using active market prices.
866374_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	The Company values available for sale investments using level 1 inputs which are active market trading prices.
866374_13_ITEM8_P151_S0	Level 2 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets) such as cash and cash equivalent and money market funds; or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
866374_13_ITEM8_P152_S0	The Company values foreign exchange forward contracts using level 2 observable inputs which primarily consist of an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
866374_13_ITEM8_P153_S0	The Company's cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits and money market funds, which are valued using level 2 inputs, such as interest rates and maturity periods.
866374_13_ITEM8_P153_S1	Due to their short-term nature, their carrying amount approximates fair value.
866374_13_ITEM8_P154_S0	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets also include money market funds, mutual funds, corporate and government bonds and certain convertible securities that are valued using prices obtained from various pricing sources.
866374_13_ITEM8_P154_S1	These sources price these investments using certain market indices and the performance of these investments in relation to these indices.
866374_13_ITEM8_P154_S2	As a result, the Company has classified these investments as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
866374_13_ITEM8_P155_S0	Level 3 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
866374_13_ITEM8_P156_S0	The Company has accrued for contingent consideration in connection with its business acquisitions, which is measured at fair value based on certain internal models and inputs.
866374_13_ITEM8_P156_S1	The following table summarizes the activities related to contingent consideration:
866374_13_ITEM8_P157_S0	The Company values deferred purchase price receivables relating to its Asset-Backed Securitization Program based on a discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable inputs (i.e. level 3 inputs), which are primarily risk free interest rates adjusted for the credit quality of the underlying creditor Due to its high credit quality and short term maturity, their fair value approximates carrying value.
866374_13_ITEM8_P157_S1	Significant increases in either of the significant unobservable inputs (credit spread or risk free interest rate) in isolation would result in lower fair value estimates, however is insignificant.
866374_13_ITEM8_P157_S2	The interrelationship between these inputs is also insignificant.
866374_13_ITEM8_P157_S3	Refer to note 8 to the notes of consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the change in the deferred purchase price receivable.
866374_13_ITEM8_P158_S0	The Company has warrants to purchase up to 1.35 million shares of the common stock of a certain supplier at a weighted-average price of $7.33 per share.
866374_13_ITEM8_P158_S1	The warrants expire on May 18, 2018.
866374_13_ITEM8_P158_S2	These fully vested warrants, which are derivative instruments, are fair valued at each reporting date with gains or losses from changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_13_ITEM8_P158_S3	The Company values these warrants based on the Black-Scholes option-valuation model using unobservable inputs classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
866374_13_ITEM8_P158_S4	Significant changes in any of the significant unobservable inputs in isolation would result in a change in the fair value estimate, but in each case, the amount would be insignificant.
866374_13_ITEM8_P158_S5	The interrelationship between these inputs is also insignificant.
866374_13_ITEM8_P158_S6	As of March 31, 2013, the Company used the following assumptions to fair value these warrants:
866374_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	The following table summarizes the changes in the fair value adjustment of these warrants:
866374_13_ITEM8_P160_S0	There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy during fiscal years 2013 and 2012.
866374_13_ITEM8_P161_S0	The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2013 and 2012:
866374_13_ITEM8_P162_S0	The Company has certain long-lived assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, and are as follows:
866374_13_ITEM8_P163_S0	Assets held for sale are recorded at the lesser of the carrying value or fair value, which is based on comparable sales from prevailing market data (level 2 inputs).
866374_13_ITEM8_P163_S1	As of March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2012, no impairment charges were recorded for assets that were no longer in use and held for sale which exclude those assets that have been identified as relating to discontinued operations as discussed further in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_13_ITEM8_P163_S2	The assets held for sale primarily represent manufacturing facilities that have been closed as part of the Company's historical facility consolidations.
866374_13_ITEM8_P164_S0	During the fiscal year 2013, the Company recognized impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets classified as 'held-for-use' since the carrying value of such assets exceeded the fair value, based on the sales of comparable assets, as a result of its restructuring activities as further discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_13_ITEM8_P165_S0	There were no material fair value adjustments or other transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy for these long-lived assets during the fiscal years 2013 and 2012.
866374_13_ITEM8_P166_S0	The following table presents the Company's liabilities not carried at fair value as at March 31, 2013 and 2012:
866374_13_ITEM8_P167_S0	The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short term nature of the interest rates underlying any borrowings under this facility, though the facility itself is available to the Company on a long term basis.
866374_13_ITEM8_P168_S0	Term loans dated October 1, 2007 and October 19, 2011 The term loans are valued based on broker trading prices in active markets.
866374_13_ITEM8_P169_S0	Notes dated February 20, 2013 The notes are valued based on broker trading prices in active markets.
866374_13_ITEM8_P170_S0	Asia term loans The Company's Asia Term Loans are not traded publicly; however, as the pricing, maturity and other pertinent terms of these loans closely approximate those of the Term Loan Agreements dated October 1, 2007, and October 19, 2011, management estimates the respective trading prices would be approximately the same.
866374_13_ITEM8_P171_S0	As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, the gross carrying amount and associated accumulated depreciation of the Company's property and equipment financed under capital leases, and the related obligations was not material.
866374_13_ITEM8_P171_S1	The Company also leases certain of its facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.
866374_13_ITEM8_P171_S2	These operating leases expire in various years through 2028 and require the following minimum lease payments:
866374_13_ITEM8_P172_S0	Total rent expense amounted to $138.8 million, $160.5 million and $153.2 million in fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM8_P173_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
866374_13_ITEM8_P173_S1	We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims.
866374_13_ITEM8_P173_S2	Although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management expects that any losses that are probable or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of these matters, which are in excess of amounts already accrued in its consolidated balance sheet, would not be material to the financial statements as a whole.
866374_13_ITEM8_P174_S0	The domestic (Singapore) and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes were comprised of the following:
866374_13_ITEM8_P175_S0	The provision for income taxes consisted of the following:
866374_13_ITEM8_P176_S0	The domestic statutory income tax rate was approximately 17.0% in fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011.
866374_13_ITEM8_P176_S1	The reconciliation of the income tax expense expected based on domestic statutory income tax rates to the expense for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows:
866374_13_ITEM8_P177_S0	A number of countries in which the Company is located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business.
866374_13_ITEM8_P177_S1	In general, these holidays were secured based on the nature, size and location of the Company's operations.
866374_13_ITEM8_P177_S2	The aggregate dollar effect on the Company's income resulting from tax holidays and tax incentives to attract and retain business for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $22.6 million, $41.8 million and $66.5 million, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM8_P177_S3	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share was $0.03 and $0.03, respectively, and the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were $0.06 and $0.06, and $0.09 and $0.08, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM8_P178_S0	Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, the Company's existing holidays will expire in the fiscal years ending March 31, 2014 through fiscal year 2022.
866374_13_ITEM8_P179_S0	Under its territorial tax system, Singapore generally does not tax foreign sourced income until repatriated to Singapore.
866374_13_ITEM8_P179_S1	The Company has included the effects of Singapore's territorial tax system in the rate differential line above.
866374_13_ITEM8_P180_S0	fiscal years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $26.7 million, $17.7 million and $32.6 million, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM8_P181_S0	The components of deferred income taxes are as follows:
866374_13_ITEM8_P182_S0	Utilization of the Company's deferred tax assets is limited by the future earnings of the Company in the tax jurisdictions in which such deferred assets arose.
866374_13_ITEM8_P182_S1	As a result, management is uncertain as to when or whether these operations will generate sufficient profit to realize any benefit from the deferred tax assets.
866374_13_ITEM8_P183_S0	The valuation allowance provides a reserve against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized by the Company.
866374_13_ITEM8_P183_S1	However, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize certain of these benefits and, accordingly, has recognized a deferred tax asset from these benefits.
866374_13_ITEM8_P183_S2	The change in valuation allowance is net of certain increases and decreases to prior year losses and other carryforwards that have no current impact on the tax provision.
866374_13_ITEM8_P183_S3	Approximately $34.0 million of the valuation allowance relates to income tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options, which if realized will be credited directly to shareholders' equity and will not be available to benefit the income tax provision in any future period.
866374_13_ITEM8_P184_S0	The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $43.7 million associated with its tax loss and tax credit carryforwards.
866374_13_ITEM8_P185_S0	The amount of the remaining deferred tax asset expires over the period from 2014 to 2032, of which the amount expiring in 2014 is insignificant.
866374_13_ITEM8_P186_S0	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced or increased in the near-term if facts, including the amount of taxable income or the mix of taxable income between subsidiaries, differ from management's estimates.
866374_13_ITEM8_P187_S0	The Company does not provide for income taxes on approximately $457.7 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, as such earnings are not intended by management to be repatriated in the foreseeable future.
866374_13_ITEM8_P187_S1	Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
866374_13_ITEM8_P188_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
866374_13_ITEM8_P189_S0	The Company's unrecognized tax benefits are subject to change over the next twelve months primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and as audits are settled.
866374_13_ITEM8_P189_S1	During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $13.2 million due to the settlement of a tax audit subsequent to the balance sheet date.
866374_13_ITEM8_P189_S2	The Company also believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by an estimated range of $18.0 to $30.8 million within the next twelve months primarily due to potential settlements of various audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.
866374_13_ITEM8_P190_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file federal, state, and local income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions around the world.
866374_13_ITEM8_P190_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2001.
866374_13_ITEM8_P191_S0	Of the $230 million of unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2013, $172.8 million will affect the annual effective tax rate if the benefits are eventually recognized.
866374_13_ITEM8_P191_S1	The amount that does not impact the effective tax rate relates to positions that would be settled with a tax loss carryforward previously subject to a valuation allowance.
866374_13_ITEM8_P192_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within the Company's tax expense.
866374_13_ITEM8_P192_S1	During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized interest of approximately $5.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively, and no penalties.
866374_13_ITEM8_P193_S0	Company had approximately $11.9 million and $10.6 million accrued for the payment of interest as of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM8_P193_S1	The Company has not accrued for the payment of penalties for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM8_P194_S0	During fiscal year 2013 the Company initiated certain restructuring activities intended to improve its operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce and capacity.
866374_13_ITEM8_P194_S1	Restructuring charges are recorded based upon employee termination dates, site closure and consolidation plans.
866374_13_ITEM8_P195_S0	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, the Company recognized restructuring charges of approximately $227.4 million, of which $110.1 million was associated with the terminations of 9,138 identified employees in connection with the charges described above.
866374_13_ITEM8_P195_S1	The identified employee terminations by reportable geographic region amounted to approximately 4,467, 2,282, and 2,389 for Asia, the Americas and Europe, respectively.
866374_13_ITEM8_P195_S2	The costs associated with these restructuring activities include employee severance, other personnel costs, non-cash impairment charges on facilities and equipment that are not recoverable through future cash flows or are no longer in use and are to be disposed of, and other exit related costs due to facility closures or rationalizations.
866374_13_ITEM8_P195_S3	Pre-tax restructuring charges comprised of $123.0 million of cash charges predominantly related to employee severance costs and $104.4 million of non-cash charges primarily related asset impairment and other exit charges.
866374_13_ITEM8_P195_S4	The Company classified approximately $215.8 million of these charges as a component of cost of sales and approximately $11.6 million of these charges as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013.

866374_13_ITEM8_P198_S0	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 the Company recognized approximately $69.5 million for the write-down of property and equipment and other manufacturing assets, which are continuing to be held and used by the Company.
866374_13_ITEM8_P198_S1	The majority of this amount was classified as a component of cost of sales.
866374_13_ITEM8_P199_S0	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, the Company recognized approximately $47.9 million of other exit costs, which primarily comprised of $22.8 million for the write-down of certain customer specific assets that were determined to be unrecoverable based on a specific product exit and resulting declining customer volumes.
866374_13_ITEM8_P199_S1	Additionally, other exit costs include $24.7 million of customer disengagement costs primarily related to inventory that resulted from a product exit as well as contractual obligations from facility closures and $0.4 million of other miscellaneous items.
866374_13_ITEM8_P200_S0	The following table summarizes the provisions, respective payments, and remaining accrued balance as of March 31, 2013 for charges incurred in fiscal year 2013 and prior periods:

866374_13_ITEM8_P201_S1	The fair value adjustment gain was partially off-set by a loss on the sales of two investments of $1.3 million.
866374_13_ITEM8_P202_S0	During fiscal year 2012, the Company recognized a net gain of $20.0 million in connection with the sale of certain international entities.

866374_13_ITEM8_P203_S2	These charges were partially offset by a gain of $18.6 million associated with the sale of an equity investment that was previously fully impaired.

866374_13_ITEM8_P207_S0	The business and asset acquisitions described below were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the fair value of the net assets acquired and the results of the acquired businesses were included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the acquisition dates forward.
866374_13_ITEM8_P207_S1	The Company has not finalized the allocation of the consideration for certain of its recently completed acquisitions and expects to complete these allocations within one year of the respective acquisition dates.
866374_13_ITEM8_P208_S0	Acquisition of Saturn Electronics and Engineering Inc.
866374_13_ITEM8_P209_S0	During fiscal year 2013, the Company completed its acquisition of all outstanding common stock of Saturn Electronics and Engineering, Inc. ("Saturn"), a supplier of electronics manufacturing services, solenoids and wiring for the automotive, appliance, consumer, energy and industrial markets.
866374_13_ITEM8_P209_S1	The acquisition of Saturn broadened the Company's service offering and strengthened its capabilities in the automotive and consumer electronics businesses.

866374_13_ITEM8_P210_S0	Net income during fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 was not significant to the consolidated operating results of the Company.

866374_13_ITEM8_P212_S0	The allocation of the purchase price to Saturn's tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition.
866374_13_ITEM8_P212_S1	Management determined the value of acquired intangible assets with the assistance of a third-party appraisal firm.
866374_13_ITEM8_P213_S0	Management is in the process of determining the fair value amounts for certain other assets and liabilities that were acquired.
866374_13_ITEM8_P213_S1	The excess of the purchase price over the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to goodwill.
866374_13_ITEM8_P214_S0	The following represents the Company's allocation of the total purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed of Saturn (in thousands):

866374_13_ITEM8_P216_S0	The above purchase price allocation includes certain purchase accounting adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, which resulted in a net decrease of $7.5 million to goodwill with corresponding increases to intangible assets amounting to $32.5 million and other liabilities amounting to $23.0 million.
866374_13_ITEM8_P216_S1	The increase in intangible assets was as a result of the finalization of the valuation for acquired intangible assets and the increase to other liabilities is primarily as a result of deferred tax liabilities recorded relating to intangible assets.
866374_13_ITEM8_P216_S2	As a result of this deferred tax liability, the Company released an amount of $22.3 million relating to valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, and this amount is included in the provision for income taxes for the year ended March 31, 2013.

866374_13_ITEM8_P223_S0	The goodwill generated from the Company's business combinations completed during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 is primarily related to value placed on the employee workforce, service offerings and capabilities, and expected synergies.

866374_13_ITEM8_P245_S1	These notes are senior unsecured obligations and were issued by Flextronics International Limited ("Parent"), and are guaranteed, fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by certain of the Company's 100% owned subsidiaries (the "guarantor subsidiaries").
866374_13_ITEM8_P245_S2	These subsidiary guarantees will terminate upon 1) a sale or other disposition of the guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the guarantor (other than to Flextronics or a subsidiary); 2) such guarantor ceasing to be a guarantor or a borrower under the Company's Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Line of Credit; 3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in the Notes indenture; or 4) if at any time the notes are rated investment grade.

866374_13_ITEM8_P246_S1	The principal elimination entries relate to investment in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions, including transactions with the Company's non-guarantor subsidiaries.
866374_13_ITEM8_P247_S0	The following table contains unaudited quarterly financial data for fiscal years 2013 and 2012.
866374_13_ITEM8_P247_S1	Earnings per share are computed independently for each quarter presented; therefore, the sum of the quarterly earnings per share may not equal the total earnings per share amounts for the fiscal year.
866374_13_ITEM8_P248_S0	(1) As discussed in note 18 to the financial statements, "Discontinued Operations", during fiscal 2013 the Company finalized the sale of two of its non-core businesses, and is reporting the operating results of these non-core businesses as discontinued operations.
866374_13_ITEM8_P248_S1	Accordingly net sales and gross profit data above have been adjusted to exclude net revenue and gross profit (loss) pertaining to these non-core businesses.
866374_13_ITEM8_P249_S0	The Company recorded restructuring charges during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2013.
866374_13_ITEM8_P249_S1	The Company classified approximately $98.3 million and $117.5 million of these charges as a component of cost of sales during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2013, respectively, and approximately $4.4 million and $7.2 million of these charges as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2013, respectively.

866374_13_ITEM8_P251_S0	Management believes the impact of the error is not material to current or prior fiscal periods.
866374_13_ITEM8_P252_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company recorded certain purchase accounting adjustments as further discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements which resulted in the release of $22.3 million related to the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
866374_13_ITEM8_P252_S1	In accordance with the accounting guidance applicable to business combinations, the Company has re-casted the operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 in the table above to reflect the release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

866374_13_ITEM8_P253_S1	Management believes the impact of this error is not material to current or prior fiscal periods.
866374_13_ITEM8_P254_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company identified certain accounting errors in the statutory to US GAAP adjustments at one of its foreign sites that originated in prior interim and annual periods.
866374_13_ITEM8_P254_S1	Management conducted additional procedures and concluded that these errors were isolated to that location.
866374_13_ITEM8_P254_S2	These errors, which primarily understated cost of sales, totaled $0.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2012 and $10.4 million and $8.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, and were corrected by the Company as an out-of-period adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
866374_13_ITEM8_P254_S3	This fourth quarter adjustment was partially offset by the correction of an error identified in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 amounting to $4.2 million related to the provisions for income taxes in the prior fiscal 2012 interim periods.
866374_13_ITEM8_P254_S4	Management believes the impact of these items, both individually and in the aggregate, to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and to prior fiscal and interim periods presented was not material.
866374_13_ITEM8_P254_S5	As a result of recording these adjustments in the fourth quarter, net income for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2012 were reduced by $21.5 million ($0.03 per share) and $24.9 million ($0.03 per share), respectively.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2013, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	As of March 31, 2013, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation was conducted of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").
866374_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was adequately designed and operating effectively as of March 31, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements or prevent or detect instances of fraud.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management's annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013 excluded the internal control over financial reporting of Saturn , which constitutes, in aggregate, 9.4% and 2.6% of net and total assets, respectively, and 0.4% of net sales and 0.4% of direct cost of sales of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	On December 3, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Saturn, at which time Saturn became a subsidiary of the Company.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	See note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Other than these business acquisitions, there were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended March 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Flextronics International Ltd.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Flextronics International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P6_S1	As described in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Saturn Electronics and Engineering Inc., which was acquired on December 3, 2012 and whose financial statements constitute 9.4% and 2.6% of net and total assets, respectively, 0.4% of net sales and 0.4% of direct cost of sales of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended March 31, 2013.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Saturn Electronics and Engineering Inc.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P6_S3	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P6_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
866374_13_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P7_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_13_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

866374_13_ITEM15_P125_S0	Your realtor and AIReS will periodically review marketing activity on your home and may recommend a price reduction as part of a targeted plan to competitively market your property.
866374_13_ITEM15_P125_S1	You will not be required to reduce your price based on that advice but it is recommended that you critically evaluate all recommendations and determine if the price reduction will bring in an offer on the home.
866374_13_ITEM15_P125_S2	If you do not reduce your listing price and your home does not sell, you may be responsible for all duplicate living costs.
866374_13_ITEM15_P126_S0	There is a general time limit of one year to sell your home through the BVO program.

866374_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	Although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it, from time to time third parties do assert patent infringement claims against us or our customers.
866374_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	In addition, we provide design and engineering services to our customers and also design and make our own products.
866374_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	As a consequence of these activities, our customers are requiring us to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses.
866374_14_ITEM1_P83_S3	If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_14_ITEM1_P83_S4	Such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor.
866374_14_ITEM1_P83_S5	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome.
866374_14_ITEM1_P83_S6	We also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services.
866374_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	Refer to note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for financial information about our geographic areas.
866374_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	We make available through our Internet website the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
866374_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	We were incorporated in the Republic of Singapore in May 1990.
866374_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	Our principal corporate office is located at 2 Changi South Lane, Singapore 486123.
866374_14_ITEM1_P86_S2	Our U.S. corporate headquarters is located at 6201 America Center Drive, San Jose, CA, 95002.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We depend on industries that continually produce technologically advanced products with short life cycles and our business would be adversely affected if our customers' products are not successful or if our customers lose market share.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We derive our revenues from customers in the following business groups:
866374_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	HRS, which is comprised of our medical, automotive, defense and aerospace businesses; HVS, which includes our mobile devices business, including smart phones; our consumer electronics business, including game consoles and wearable electronics; and high-volume computing business, including various supply chain solutions for notebook personal computing ("PC"), tablets and printers; IEI, which is comprised of our household appliances, semi-cap equipment, kiosks, energy and emerging industries businesses; and INS, which includes our telecommunications infrastructure, data networking, connected home, and server and storage businesses.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Factors affecting any of these industries in general or our customers in particular, could adversely impact us.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	rapid changes in technology, evolving industry standards and requirements for continuous improvement in products and services result in short product life cycles; demand for our customers' products may be seasonal; our customers may fail to successfully market their products, and our customers' products may fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance; our customers may experience dramatic market share shifts in demand which may cause them to lose market share or exit the business; and there may be recessionary periods in our customers' markets, such as the recent global economic downturn.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and the inherent difficulties involved in responding to these demands could harm our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers have harmed, and may in the future harm, our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and deliver for these customers, by causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and by lowering our asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	against other providers as well as against the merits of manufacturing products themselves.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our business would be adversely affected if OEMs decide to perform these functions internally or transfer their business to another provider.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	As a provider of design and manufacturing services and components for electronics, we must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround time for our customers.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and we often experience reduced lead times in customer orders which may be less than the lead time we require to procure necessary components and materials.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of our customers.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	This makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In that regard, we must make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, setting production schedules, making component procurement commitments, and allocating personnel and other resources, based on our estimates of our customers' requirements.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production or require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to reduce costs or achieve other objectives.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	These demands stress our resources and reduce our margins.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands, and transfers from one facility to another can result in inefficiencies and costs due to excess capacity in one facility and corresponding capacity constraints at another.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Due to many of our costs and operating expenses being relatively fixed, customer order fluctuations, deferrals and transfers of demand from one facility to another, as described above, have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past and we may experience such effects in the future.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our industry is extremely competitive; if we are not able to continue to provide competitive services, we may lose business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We compete with a number of different companies, depending on the type of service we provide or the location of our operations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	For example, we compete with major global EMS providers, other smaller EMS companies that have a regional or product-specific focus and ODMs with respect to some of the services that we provide.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We also compete with our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our industry is extremely competitive, many of our competitors have achieved substantial market share, and some may have lower cost structures or greater design, manufacturing, financial or other resources than we do.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We face particular competition from Asian-based competitors, including Taiwanese ODM suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If we are unable to provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at lower cost than the other companies in our market, our net sales could decline.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a decline in sales to any of these customers could adversely affect our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Sales to our ten largest customers represent a significant percentage of our net sales.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 52%, 47% and 55% of net sales in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Only Google (including Motorola) accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal 2014.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	No customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2013.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our largest customers during fiscal year 2012 were Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Blackberry, which each accounted for more than 10% of net sales.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Our principal customers have varied from year to year.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P14_S6	These customers may experience dramatic declines in their market shares or competitive position, due to economic or other forces, that may cause them to reduce their purchases from us or, in some cases, result in the termination of their relationship with us.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Significant reductions in sales to any of these customers, or the loss of major customers, would materially harm our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P14_S8	If we are not able to timely replace expired, canceled or reduced contracts with new business, our revenues and profitability could be harmed.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our components business is dependent on our ability to quickly launch world-class components products, and our investment in the development of our component capabilities, together with the start-up and integration costs necessary to achieve quick launches of world-class components products, may adversely affect our margins and profitability.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our components business, which includes rigid and flexible printed circuit board fabrication, and power supplies manufacturing, is part of our strategy to improve our competitive position and to grow our future margins, profitability and shareholder returns by expanding our capabilities.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The success of our components business is dependent on our ability to design and introduce world-class components that have performance characteristics which are suitable for a broad market and that offer significant price and/or performance advantages over competitive products.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	To create these world class components offerings, we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our components capabilities, in resources such as research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, facility expansions and personnel requirements.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We may not be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance for any of our components offerings in any of our current or target markets.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The success of our components business will also depend upon the level of market acceptance of our customers' end products, which incorporate our components, and over which we have no control.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition, OEMs often require unique configurations or custom designs which must be developed and integrated in the OEM's product well before the product is launched by the OEM.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Thus, there is often substantial lead time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized component and the commencement of volume shipments of the component to the OEM.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	As a result, we may make substantial investments in the development and customization of products for our customers, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not accept the customized component.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Even if our customers accept the customized component, if our customers do not purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our achievement of anticipated levels of profitability in our components business is also dependent on our ability to achieve efficiencies in our manufacturing as well as to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our OEM customers.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability in our components business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our products from these customers could decline.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty we could have difficulty sourcing supply necessary to fulfil production requirements and meet scheduled shipments.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivable are outstanding.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may be adversely affected by shortages of required electronic components.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	From time to time, we have experienced shortages of some of the electronic components that we use.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These shortages can result from strong demand for those components or from problems experienced by suppliers, such as shortages of raw materials.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	These unanticipated component shortages could result in curtailed production or delays in production, which may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a reduction in sales, increase in inventory levels and costs, and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Component shortages may also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	As a result, component shortages could adversely affect our operating results.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to incorporate changes in component costs into the selling prices for our products.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our supply chain may also be impacted by other events outside our control, including macro-economic events, political crises or natural or environmental occurrences.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Component shortages impacted our results during fiscal year 2012.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The supply constraints were broad based, but the impact was most evident with respect to connectors, capacitors, LCD panels and memory (both DRAM and Flash).
866374_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan resulted in disruptions to our supply chain, as a large number of our suppliers of semiconductors and other electronic components are located in Japan.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	These disruptions had a negative impact on our revenue in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2012.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our margins and profitability may be adversely affected due to substantial investments, start-up and production ramping costs in our design services.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	As part of our strategy to enhance our end-to-end service offerings, we have expanded and continue to expand our design and engineering capabilities.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Providing these services can expose us to different or greater potential risks than those we face when providing our manufacturing services.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Although we enter into contracts with our design services customers, we may design and develop products for these customers prior to receiving a purchase order or other firm commitment from them.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We are required to make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Even if our customers accept our designs, if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Our design activities often require that we purchase inventory for initial production runs before we have a purchase commitment from a customer.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	These contracts can generally be terminated on short notice.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, some of the products we design and develop must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some must receive government certifications.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If we fail to obtain these approvals or certifications on a timely basis, we would be unable to sell these products, which would harm our sales, profitability and reputation.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Due to the increased risks associated with our design services offerings, we may not be able to achieve a high enough level of sales for this business, and the significant investments in research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, patent applications, facility expansion and recruitment that it requires, to be profitable.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The initial costs of investing in the resources necessary to expand our design and engineering capabilities, and in particular to support our design services offerings, have historically adversely affected our profitability, and may continue to do so as we continue to make investments in these capabilities.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In addition, we agree to certain product price limitations and cost reduction targets in connection with these services.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Inflationary and other increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor required to produce the products have occurred and may recur from time to time.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Also, the production ramps for these programs are typically significant and negatively impact our margin in early stages as the manufacturing volumes are lower and result in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We may not be able to reduce costs, incorporate changes in costs into the selling prices of our products, or increase operating efficiencies as we ramp production of our products, which would adversely affect our margins and our results of operations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to risks of international operations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The distances between the Americas, Asia and Europe create a number of logistical and communications challenges for us.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	These challenges include managing operations across multiple time zones, directing the manufacture and delivery of products across distances, coordinating procurement of components and raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations, and coordinating the activities and decisions of the core management team, which is based in a number of different countries.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Facilities in several different locations may be involved at different stages of the production process of a single product, leading to additional logistical difficulties.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Because our manufacturing operations are located in a number of countries throughout the Americas, Asia and Europe, we are subject to risks of changes in economic and political conditions in those countries, including:
866374_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	a potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The attractiveness of our services to U.S. customers can be affected by changes in U.S. trade policies, such as most favored nation status and trade preferences for some Asian countries.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, some countries in which we operate, such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Mexico, Malaysia and Poland, have experienced periods of slow or negative growth, high inflation, significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Furthermore, in countries such as China, Brazil and Mexico, governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy, and their actions could have a significant effect on us.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure, including lack of adequate power and water supplies, transportation, raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P35_S4	In addition, we may encounter labor disruptions and rising labor costs, in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Any increase in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In some countries, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert our cash distributions to U.S. dollars or other freely convertible currencies, or to move funds from our accounts in these countries.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Furthermore, the central bank of any of these countries may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to approve distributions to foreign investors.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The success of certain of our activities depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We retain certain intellectual property rights to some of the technologies that we develop as part of our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The measures we have taken to prevent unauthorized use of our technology may not be successful.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties, as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our customers.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In addition, our customers are increasingly requiring us to indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In the event of such an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If our security systems are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and inventory and protecting our customers' and our suppliers' confidential information.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information systems.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Despite our efforts, we are subject to, and at times have suffered from, breach of these security systems which have in the past and may in the future result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or unauthorized use or theft of the inventory or information we are trying to protect.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	electronic access to our information systems or if such information or inventory is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information or inventory could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties including our customers and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information or inventory, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from the breach of our security systems.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If our compliance policies are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We have implemented local and global compliance policies to ensure compliance with our legal obligations across our operations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	A significant legal risk resulting from our international operations is compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local laws of the countries in which we do business, including the UK Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits covered companies from making payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our Code of Business Conduct prohibits corrupt payments on a global basis and precludes us from offering or giving anything of value to a government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, to win a business advantage or to improperly influence a decision regarding Flextronics.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents will refrain from taking actions in violation of this and our related anti-corruption policies and procedures.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We are subject to risks relating to litigation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	From time to time, we are involved in various claims, suits, investigations and legal proceedings.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Additional legal claims or regulatory matters may arise in the future and could involve matters relating to commercial disputes, government regulatory and compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax, employment or shareholder issues, product liability claims and other issues on a global basis.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	The defense and ultimate outcome of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operating expenses and a decrease in operating margin, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of "conflict minerals" may result in increased costs and risks to us.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (the "Minerals"), which may be mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	The disclosure requirements will take effect for the Company in May 2014 with regards to products manufactured during calendar year 2013.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We will have to publicly disclose whether the products we sell contain these Minerals and have and may continue to incur significant costs related to implementing a process that will meet the mandates of the Act.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Additionally, customers rely on us to provide critical data regarding the products they purchase and will likely request information on such Minerals.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Our materials sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and we may not be able to easily verify the origins of the Minerals used in the products we sell.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P48_S5	We have many suppliers and each may provide the required information in a different manner, if at all.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, our reputation may suffer if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the Minerals, if any, used in our products.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P48_S7	Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of any Minerals originating in the specified countries.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide products and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for medical devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	As a medical device manufacturer, we have additional compliance requirements.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We are required to register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring by the FDA.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P51_S3	If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance with QSR or other FDA regulations, and the Company does not address the observation adequately to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA may take action against us.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P51_S4	FDA actions may include issuing a letter of inspectional observations, issuing a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the Company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, refusing requests for clearance or approval of new products or withdrawal of clearance or approval previously granted, issuing an import detention on products entering the U.S. from an offshore facility, or shutting down a manufacturing facility.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P51_S5	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In the European Union ("EU"), we are required to maintain certain standardized certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections to obtain and maintain these certifications.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Continued noncompliance to the EU regulations could stop the flow of products into the EU from us or from our customers.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	In China, the Safe Food and Drug Administration controls and regulates the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We must comply with the regulatory laws applicable to medical device manufactures or our ability to manufacture products in China could be impacted.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In Japan, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws regulate the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	These regulations also require that subcontractors manufacturing products intended for sale in Japan register with authorities and submit to regulatory audits.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Other Asian countries where we operate have similar laws regarding the regulation of medical device manufacturing.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We are subject to the risk of increased income taxes.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Our continued ability to qualify for specific tax holiday extensions will depend on, among other things, our anticipated investment and expansion in these countries and the manner in which the local governments interpret the requirements for modifications, extensions or new incentives.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions around the world.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax provision, operating results, financial position and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	If our products or components contain defects, demand for our services may decline and we may be exposed to product liability and product warranty liability.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation and expose us to product liability or product warranty claims.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Product liability claims may include liability for personal injury or property damage.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Product warranty claims may include liability to pay for the recall, repair or replacement of a product or component.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Although we generally allocate liability for these claims in our contracts with our customers, increasingly we are unsuccessful in allocating such liability, and even where we have allocated liability to our customers, our customers may not have the resources to satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product or component for which they have assumed responsibility.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	If we design, engineer or manufacture a product or component that is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could spend a significant amount of money to resolve the claim.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	In addition, product liability and product recall insurance coverage are expensive and may not be available with respect to all of our services offerings on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P63_S2	A successful product liability or product warranty claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied, limited or is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our failure to comply with environmental laws could adversely affect our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including regulations governing the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used in our manufacturing processes.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the recyclability of products, the materials that may be included in products, and our obligations to dispose of these products after end users have finished with them.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Additionally, we may be exposed to liability to our customers relating to the materials that may be included in the components that we procure for our customers' products.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Any violation or alleged violation by us of environmental laws could subject us to significant costs, fines or other penalties.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of global and local product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	We are subject to the EU directives, including the Restrictions on RoHS, the WEEE as well as the EU's REACH regulation.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P66_S2	In addition, new technical classifications of e-Waste being discussed in the Basel Convention technical working group could affect both our customers' abilities and obligations in electronics repair and refurbishment.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Also of note is China's Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by EIPs regulation, commonly referred to as "China RoHS", which restricts the importation into and production within China of electrical equipment containing certain hazardous materials.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P68_S1	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as applicable regulations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	compliance data from our suppliers, full laboratory testing and public reporting of other environmental metrics such as carbon emissions, electronic waste and water, and we also require our supply chain to comply.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P70_S2	In the case of WEEE, the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P70_S3	However, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their obligations under WEEE.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P71_S1	If more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed, or the results of future testing and analyses at our current or former operating facilities indicate that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the air, ground and/or water, we may be subject to additional liability.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Additional environmental matters may arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations or adequately address contaminated sites could limit our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to incur significant expenses, which would harm our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If we do not effectively manage changes in our operations, our business may be harmed; we have taken substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may need to take material restructuring charges in the future.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In recent years, we have experienced growth in our business through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	However, our business also has been negatively impacted by the recent adverse global economic conditions.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P73_S2	The expansion of our business, as well as business contractions and other changes in our customers' requirements, have in the past, and may in the future, require that we adjust our business and cost structures by incurring restructuring charges.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Restructuring activities involve reductions in our workforce at some locations and closure of certain facilities.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P73_S4	All of these changes have in the past placed, and may in the future place, considerable strain on our financial and management control systems and resources, including decision support, accounting management, information systems and facilities.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P73_S5	If we do not properly manage our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures to manage our employees, our business could be harmed.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	In recent years, including during fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we undertook initiatives to restructure our business operations through a series of restructuring activities, which were intended to realign our global capacity and infrastructure with demand by our OEM customers and thereby improve our operational efficiency.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	These activities included reducing excess workforce and capacity, transitioning manufacturing to lower-cost locations and eliminating redundant facilities, and consolidating and eliminating certain administrative facilities.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	While we incur severance, asset impairment charges and other charges as a result of changes in our customer mix on an ongoing basis, such individual actions were not considered material and did not qualify as restructuring charges per accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to be separately disclosed as restructuring charges in fiscal year 2012, and are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Our restructuring activities undertaken during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 have been disclosed separately on our statement of operations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We may be required to take additional charges in the future to align our operations and cost structures with global economic conditions, market demands, cost competitiveness, and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers' production requirements.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P75_S3	We may consolidate certain manufacturing facilities or transfer certain of our operations to lower cost geographies.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P75_S4	If we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	finalization and implementation of the restructuring activities, work stoppages, and the failure to achieve targeted cost savings.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our operating costs.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We have manufacturing operations and industrial parks that are located in lower cost regions of the world, such as Asia, Eastern Europe and Mexico.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Most of our purchase and some of our sale transactions are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P78_S2	As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in these currencies impacting our fixed cost overhead or our supply base relative to the currencies in which we conduct transactions.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors, including changes in a country's political and economic policies.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Volatility in the functional and non-functional currencies of our entities and the United States dollar could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The primary impact of currency exchange fluctuations is on the cash, receivables, payables and expenses of our operating entities.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	As part of our currency hedging strategy, we use financial instruments, primarily forward exchange and swap contracts, to hedge our foreign currency exposure in order to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on our operating results.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P80_S2	If our hedging activities are not successful or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected fluctuations in our operating results as a result of changes in exchange rates.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We are also exposed to risks related to the valuation of the Chinese currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	The Chinese currency is the renminbi ("RMB").
866374_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	A significant increase in the value of the RMB could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows by increasing both our manufacturing costs and the costs of our local supply base.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We depend on our executive officers and skilled management personnel.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Generally our employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P84_S2	We could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P84_S3	We will need to recruit and retain skilled management personnel, and if we are not able to do so, our business could be harmed.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P84_S4	In addition, in connection with expanding our design services offerings, we must attract and retain experienced design engineers.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P84_S5	There is substantial competition in our industry for highly skilled employees.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P84_S6	Our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our design services offerings, which could adversely affect our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in the payment of significant damages, which would reduce our net income.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, wages and overtime, discrimination, whistle-blowing, classification of employees and severance payments.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Enforcement activity relating to these laws, particularly outside of the United States, can increase as a result of increased media attention due to violations by other companies, changes in law, political and other factors.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P86_S2	There can be no assurance that we won't be found to have violated such laws in the future, due to a more aggressive enforcement posture by governmental authorities or for any other reason.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P86_S3	Any such violations could lead to the assessment of fines against us by federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees, which fines could be substantial and which would reduce our net income.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We may encounter difficulties with acquisitions, which could harm our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We have completed numerous acquisitions of businesses and we may acquire additional businesses in the future.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Any future acquisitions may require additional equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, or additional debt financing, which could increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P88_S3	As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P89_S1	The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P89_S2	The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P89_S3	In addition, the integration of acquired businesses may require that we incur significant restructuring charges.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including:
866374_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	diversion of management's attention from the normal operation of our business; potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at acquired companies; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital; lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business; and exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	These and other factors have harmed, and in the future could harm, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Our strategic relationships with major customers create risks.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	In the past, we have completed numerous strategic transactions with OEM customers.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Under these arrangements, we generally acquire inventory, equipment and other assets from the OEM, and lease or acquire their manufacturing facilities, while simultaneously entering into multi-year manufacturing and supply agreements for the production of their products.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P94_S2	We may pursue these OEM divestiture transactions in the future.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P94_S3	These arrangements entered into with divesting OEMs typically involve many risks, including the following:
866374_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	we may be unable to meet the expectations of the OEM as to volume, product quality, timeliness and cost reductions; our supply agreements with the OEMs generally do not require any minimum volumes of purchase by the OEMs, and the actual volume of purchases may be less than anticipated; and if demand for the OEMs' products declines, the OEM may reduce its volume of purchases, and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other OEMs.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	In addition, these strategic arrangements have not, and in the future may not, result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings per share.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our business and operations could be adversely impacted by climate change initiatives.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Concern over climate change has led to international legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to seasonal demand.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Two of our significant end markets are the mobile devices market and the consumer devices market.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P100_S1	These markets exhibit particular strength generally in the two quarters leading up to the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P100_S2	As a result, we have historically experienced stronger revenues in our second and third fiscal quarters as compared to our other fiscal quarters.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P100_S3	Economic or other factors leading to diminished orders in the end of the calendar year could harm our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our debt level may create limitations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	As of March 31, 2014, our total debt was approximately $2.1 billion.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P102_S1	This level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Changes in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital or to borrow additional funds.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our credit is rated by credit rating agencies.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Our 4.625% Notes and our 5.000% Notes are currently rated BB+ by Standard and Poor's ("S P") and Ba1 by Moody's, and are considered to be below "investment grade" debt by Moody's and S P.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Any further decline in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all; negatively impact the price of our common stock; increase our interest payments under some of our existing debt agreements; and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P104_S3	In addition, the interest rate payable on some of our credit facilities is subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit ratings change.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P104_S4	Thus, any potential future negative change in our credit rating may increase the interest rate payable on these credit facilities.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Weak global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and access to capital markets.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which our customers compete.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may create challenging conditions in the electronics industry.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P107_S1	These conditions may result in reduced consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries, a tightening in the credit markets, a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets and high volatility in credit, fixed income and equity markets.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P107_S2	In addition, longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P107_S3	If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other corporate purposes.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	The market price of our ordinary shares is volatile.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P109_S0	The stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of companies, including technology companies.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P109_S1	These fluctuations have often been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P109_S2	The market for our ordinary shares has been and may in the future be subject to similar volatility.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P109_S3	Factors such as fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of technological innovations or events affecting other companies in the electronics industry, currency fluctuations, general market fluctuations, and macro-economic conditions may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P110_S0	The Company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P111_S1	The Company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships, developed technology and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P111_S2	The Company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P111_S3	The Company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Refer to Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements and 'critical accounting policies' in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P113_S0	A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the Company's businesses and the Company could be required to record impairment charges on its goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact the Company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the Company's consolidated statement of operations.
866374_14_ITEM1A_P113_S1	If the Company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the Company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing credit facilities, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.

866374_14_ITEM5_P12_S0	Singapore does not impose a withholding tax on dividends.
866374_14_ITEM5_P12_S1	All dividends are tax exempt to shareholders.
866374_14_ITEM5_P13_S0	Under current Singapore tax law there is no tax on capital gains, thus any profits from the disposal of shares are not taxable in Singapore unless the gains arising from the disposal of shares are income in nature and subject to tax, especially if they arise from activities which the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore regards as the carrying on of a trade or business in Singapore (in which case, the profits on the sale would be taxable as trade profits rather than capital gains).
866374_14_ITEM5_P14_S0	Shareholders who apply, or who are required to apply, the Singapore Financial Reporting Standard 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement ("FRS 39") for the purposes of Singapore income tax may be required to recognize gains or losses (not being gains or losses in the nature of capital) in accordance with the provisions of FRS 39 (as modified by the applicable provisions of Singapore income tax law) even though no sale or disposal of shares is made.
866374_14_ITEM5_P15_S0	There is no stamp duty payable for holding shares, and no duty is payable on the acquisition of newly-issued shares.
866374_14_ITEM5_P16_S0	When existing shares are acquired in Singapore, a stamp duty is payable on the instrument of transfer of the shares at the rate of two Singapore dollars ("S$") for every S$1,000 of the market value of the shares.
866374_14_ITEM5_P16_S1	The stamp duty is borne by the purchaser unless there is an agreement to the contrary.
866374_14_ITEM5_P16_S2	If the instrument of transfer is executed outside of Singapore, the stamp duty must be paid only if the instrument of transfer is received in Singapore.
866374_14_ITEM5_P17_S0	The estate duty was abolished for deaths occurring on or after February 15, 2008.
866374_14_ITEM5_P17_S1	For deaths prior to February 15, 2008 the following rules apply:
866374_14_ITEM5_P18_S0	If an individual who is not domiciled in Singapore dies on or after January 1, 2002, no estate tax is payable in Singapore on any of our shares held by the individual.
866374_14_ITEM5_P19_S0	If property passing upon the death of an individual domiciled in Singapore includes our shares, Singapore estate duty is payable to the extent that the value of the shares aggregated with any other assets subject to Singapore estate duty exceeds S$600,000.
866374_14_ITEM5_P19_S1	Unless other exemptions apply to the other assets, for example, the separate exemption limit for residential properties, any excess beyond S$600,000 will be taxed at 5% on the first S$12,000,000 of the individual's chargeable assets and thereafter at 10%.
866374_14_ITEM5_P20_S0	An individual shareholder who is a U.S. citizen or resident (for U.S. estate tax purposes) will have the value of the shares included in the individual's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes.
866374_14_ITEM5_P20_S1	An individual shareholder generally will be entitled to a tax credit against the shareholder's U.S. estate tax to the extent the individual shareholder actually pays Singapore estate tax on the value of the shares; however, such tax credit is generally limited to the percentage of the U.S. estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the value of the shares included in the shareholder's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes, adjusted further by a pro rata apportionment of available exemptions.
866374_14_ITEM5_P20_S2	Individuals who are domiciled in Singapore should consult their own tax advisors regarding the Singapore estate tax consequences of their investment.
866374_14_ITEM5_P21_S0	There is no reciprocal income tax treaty between the U.S. and Singapore regarding withholding taxes on dividends and capital gains.

866374_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a globally-recognized leading provider of supply chain solutions that span from concept through consumption.
866374_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	We design, build, ship and service a complete packaged electronic product for original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") in the following business groups: High Reliability Solutions ("HRS"), which is comprised of our medical, automotive, and defense and aerospace businesses; High Velocity Solutions ("HVS"), which includes our mobile devices business, including smart phones; our consumer electronics business, including game consoles and wearable electronics; and our high-volume computing business, including various supply chain solutions for notebook personal computing ("PC"), tablets and printers; Industrial and Emerging Industries ("IEI"), which is comprised of our household appliances, semi-cap equipment, kiosks, energy and emerging industries businesses; and Integrated Network Solutions ("INS"), which includes our telecommunications infrastructure, data networking, connected home, and server and storage businesses.
866374_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our strategy is to provide customers with a full range of cost competitive, vertically-integrated global supply chain solutions through which we can design, build, ship and service a complete packaged product for our OEM customers.
866374_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	This enables our OEM customers to leverage our supply chain solutions to meet their product requirements throughout the entire product life cycle.
866374_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	During the recent years, we have seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, primarily in the technology sector.
866374_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Some companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, internet service providers or e-commerce retailers have started to enter the highly competitive and rapidly evolving hardware markets, such as mobile devices, home entertainment and wearable devices.
866374_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	This trend has resulted in a significant change in the manufacturing and supply chain solutions requirements of such companies.
866374_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	While the products have become more complex, the supply chain solutions required by such companies have become more customized and demanding, and it has changed the manufacturing and supply chain landscape significantly.
866374_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	We use a portfolio management approach to manage our extensive service offerings.
866374_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	As our OEM customers change in the way they go to market, we reorganize and rebalance our business portfolio in order to align with our customers' needs and requirements and to optimize our operating results.
866374_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	With the acquisition of certain manufacturing operations from Google's Motorola Mobility LLC during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we have experienced an increase in the percentage of our revenues from the HVS business group, and expect the amount of revenue from our HVS business group, relative to total revenue, to stabilize going forward.
866374_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	reposition our assets and resources to meet specific customer needs across all of the markets we serve, and we have been able to successfully reposition our assets and capacity between various business groups to serve our customers as required, which illustrates the overall flexibility of our model.
866374_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	During fiscal years 2013 and 2014, we launched multiple programs broadly across our portfolio of services, and, in some instances, we deployed certain new technologies.
866374_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	We expect that these new programs will continue to increase in complexity in order to provide competitive advantages to our customers.
866374_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	We anticipate these programs will continue ramping with an increase in volume production during fiscal year 2015 and beyond.
866374_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	Until we achieve such higher levels of revenue, we expect that our gross margin and operating margin may be negatively impacted as profitability normally lags revenue growth due to incremental start-up costs, operational inefficiencies, under-absorbed overhead costs and lower manufacturing program volumes while in the ramp phase.
866374_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	We expect that our margins for these programs will improve over time as the revenue increases due to increased volumes.
866374_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	We are one of the world's largest providers of global supply chain solutions, with revenues of $26.1 billion in fiscal year 2014.
866374_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	We have established an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world's major electronics markets (Asia, the Americas and Europe) in order to serve the growing outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	We design, build, ship, and service electronics products for our customers through a network of facilities in approximately 30 countries across four continents.
866374_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	As of March 31, 2014, our total manufacturing capacity was approximately 26.0 million square feet.
866374_14_ITEM7_P8_S4	In fiscal year 2014, our net sales in Asia, the Americas and Europe represented approximately 53%, 31% and 16%, respectively, of our total net sales, based on the location of the manufacturing site.
866374_14_ITEM7_P8_S5	The following tables set forth net sales and net property and equipment, by country, based on the location of our manufacturing sites and the relative percentages:
866374_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	electronics products for leading multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Specifically, we have launched multiple product innovation centers ("PIC") focused exclusively on offering our OEM customers the ability to simplify their global product development, manufacturing process, and after sales services, and enable them to achieve meaningful time to market and cost savings.
866374_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including the following:
866374_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	changes in the macro-economic environment and related changes in consumer demand; the mix of the manufacturing services we are providing, the number and size of new manufacturing programs, the degree to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity, seasonal demand, shortages of components and other factors; the effects on our business when our customers are not successful in marketing their products, or when their products do not gain widespread commercial acceptance; our ability to achieve commercially viable production yields and to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our OEM customers; the effects on our business due to our customers' products having short product life cycles; our customers' ability to cancel or delay orders or change production quantities; our customers' decision to choose internal manufacturing instead of outsourcing for their product requirements; our exposure to financially troubled customers; integration of acquired businesses and facilities; increased labor costs due to adverse labor conditions in the markets we operate; and changes in tax legislation.
866374_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Net revenues for fiscal year 2014 increased 10.8% or $2.5 billion to $26.1 billion.
866374_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	This increase was primarily attributable to our acquisition of certain manufacturing operations from Google's Motorola Mobility LLC (Motorola), which was partially offset by the disengagement of our assembly activities with Blackberry during fiscal 2013, which contributed revenue in that year of approximately $0.9 billion.
866374_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our revenue increased across all of the business groups we serve except for INS.
866374_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	Our fiscal year 2014 gross profit totaled $1.4 billion, representing an increase of $274.0 million, or 23.5%, and our income from continuing operations totaled $365.6 million, representing an increase of $63.1 million, compared to fiscal year 2013.
866374_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	Both gross profit and income from continuing operations increased primarily due to lower restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2014 as a result of less cost reduction activities as compared to prior year.
866374_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	Additionally, the increase in income from continuing operations was partially offset by $55.0 million of other charges for a contractual obligation for certain performance provisions as defined in an existing manufacturing agreement with a customer.
866374_14_ITEM7_P12_S6	Additionally, our income from continuing operations in fiscal year 2013 included a gain from the fair value adjustment of $74.4 million relating to warrants to purchase common shares of a supplier.
866374_14_ITEM7_P12_S7	These warrants were exercised and the underlying shares were sold for total proceeds of $67.3 million resulting in a loss of $7.1 million that was recognized during fiscal 2014.
866374_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Cash provided by operations increased approximately $101.0 million to $1.2 billion for fiscal year 2014 compared with $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2013 primarily due to increased net income and to a lesser extent due to changes in operating assets and liabilities.
866374_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	approximately 6.8%, 7.8% and 6.2% for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	The decrease in the percentage for the year ended March 31, 2014 is primarily attributable to higher revenue from our HVS business which carries significantly higher inventory turns and customers with contractually shorter payment terms resulting in a decrease in our average net working capital in fiscal year 2014.
866374_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Our free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment, was $701.5 million for fiscal year 2014 compared to $680.1 million for fiscal year 2013, primarily due to higher cash flows from operations partially offset by higher net capital expenditure.
866374_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for the free cash flows reconciliation to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of cash flows from operations.
866374_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $410.8 million during fiscal year 2014 and included repurchases of approximately 60.7 million ordinary shares at an aggregate purchase value of $475.3 million.
866374_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	As of March 31, 2014 and 2013, $5.5 million and $12.0 million was included in accrued expenses for approximately 0.6 million and 1.8 million ordinary shares, respectively, that were not settled by the end of the year.
866374_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Additionally, in response to a challenging macroeconomic environment, we initiated certain restructuring activities in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 intended to improve our operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce and capacity.
866374_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The restructuring activities are intended to realign our corporate cost structure, and rationalize our global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure which will result in a further shift of manufacturing capacity to locations with higher efficiencies.
866374_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, we recognized $75.3 million of pre-tax restructuring charges primarily comprised of $73.4 million of cash charges predominantly related to employee severance costs.
866374_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, we recognized $227.4 million of pre-tax restructuring charges comprised of $123.0 million of cash charges primarily related to employee severance costs and $104.4 million of non-cash charges primarily related to asset impairment and other exit charges.
866374_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	We believe that our business transformation has strategically positioned us very well to take advantage of the long-term, future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities, design and engineering services and after-market services, which remain strong.
866374_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
866374_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
866374_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
866374_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	We recognize manufacturing revenue when we ship goods or the goods are received by our customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured.
866374_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Generally, there are no formal substantive customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services.
866374_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	If such requirements or obligations exist, then we recognize the related revenues at the time when such requirements are completed and the obligations are fulfilled.
866374_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Some of our customer contracts allow us to recover certain costs related to manufacturing services that are over and above the prices we charge for the related products.
866374_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Also, certain customer contracts may contain certain commitments and obligations that may result in additional expenses or decrease in revenue.
866374_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	We accrue for these commitments and obligations based on facts and circumstances and contractual terms.
866374_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	We also make provisions for estimated sales returns and other adjustments at the time revenue is recognized based upon contractual terms and an analysis of historical returns.
866374_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	Provisions for sales returns and other adjustments were not material to our consolidated financial statements for any of the periods presented.
866374_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	We provide a comprehensive suite of services for our customers that range from advanced product design to manufacturing and logistics to after-sales services.
866374_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	We recognize service revenue when the services have been performed, and the related costs are expensed as incurred.
866374_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	Our net sales for services were less than 10% of our total sales for all periods presented, and accordingly, are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	We have an established customer credit policy through which we manage customer credit exposures through credit evaluations, credit limit setting, monitoring, and enforcement of credit limits for new and existing customers.
866374_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and make provisions for doubtful accounts based on the outcome of those credit evaluations.
866374_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances, current economic trends, historical experience with collections and the age of past due receivables.
866374_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	To the extent we identify exposures as a result of credit or customer evaluations, we also review other customer related exposures, including but not limited to inventory and related contractual obligations.
866374_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	We recognize restructuring charges related to our plans to close or consolidate excess manufacturing and administrative facilities and to realign our corporate cost structure.
866374_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	In connection with these activities, we recognize restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other exit-related costs.
866374_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The recognition of these restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	To the extent our actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	Such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	We review property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
866374_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of these long-lived assets exceeds their fair value.
866374_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Recoverability of property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets are measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
866374_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets exceeds fair value.
866374_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our judgments regarding projected cash flows for an extended period of time and the fair value of assets may be impacted by changes in market conditions, general business environment and other factors.
866374_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	To the extent our estimates relating to cash flows and fair value of assets change adversely we may have to recognize additional impairment charges in the future.
866374_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value.
866374_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short-term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand.
866374_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	We purchase our inventory based on forecasted demand, and we estimate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand, and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers.
866374_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	If actual market conditions or our customers' product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional write downs may be required.
866374_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	In addition, unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers and/or changes in economic conditions may require additional write downs for inventories due to our customers' inability to fulfill their contractual obligations with regard to inventory procured to fulfill customer demand.
866374_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	We may be exposed to certain liabilities relating to our business operations, acquisitions of businesses and assets and other activities.
866374_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	We make provisions for such liabilities when it is probable that the settlement of the liability will result in an outflow of economic resources or the impairment of an asset.
866374_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	We make these assessments based on facts and circumstances that may change in the future resulting in additional expenses.
866374_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities which will result in deductible amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards.
866374_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Based on estimates, the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize these deferred income tax assets.
866374_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors.
866374_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets previously recognized, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.
866374_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio, which consists of highly liquid investments or bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from original dates of purchase and are classified as cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.

866374_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions and highly rated money market accounts.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Our investment policy has strict guidelines focusing on preservation of capital.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The portfolio is comprised of various instruments including term deposits with banks, marketable securities and money market accounts. .
866374_14_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Our cash is principally invested in the U.S. dollar and China renminbi serving as a natural hedge of our RMB denominated costs.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P0_S6	As of March 31, 2014, the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was $0.6 billion, the largest components of which were RMB denominated money market accounts with an average return of 4.5%.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P0_S7	A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We had variable rate debt outstanding of approximately $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2014.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Variable rate debt obligations consisted of borrowings under our term loans.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Interest on these obligations is discussed above.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Our variable rate debt instruments create exposures for us related to interest rate risk.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Primarily due to the current low interest rates a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	As of March 31, 2014, the approximate fair value of our debt outstanding under our term loan facilities that matures in March 2019 and August 2018, and Notes due February 2020 and 2023 was 101.0% of the face value of the debt obligations based on broker trading prices.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	We have established a foreign currency risk management policy to manage this risk.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	To the extent possible, we manage our foreign currency exposure by evaluating and using non-financial techniques, such as currency of invoice, leading and lagging payments and receivables management.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P6_S3	In addition, we may borrow in various foreign currencies and enter into short-term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities, mainly accounts receivable and accounts payable, and cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We endeavor to maintain a partial or fully hedged position for certain transaction exposures.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	These exposures are primarily, but not limited to, revenues, customer and vendor payments and inter-company balances in currencies other than the functional currency unit of the operating entity.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The credit risk of our foreign currency forward and swap contracts is minimized since all contracts are with large financial institutions and accordingly, fair value adjustments related to the credit risk of the counter-party financial institution were not material.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The gains and losses on forward and swap contracts generally offset the losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and transactions hedged.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The fair value of currency forward and swap contracts is reported on the balance sheet.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts as of March 31, 2014 amounted to $4.5 billion and the recorded fair values of the associated assets and liabilities were not material.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The majority of these foreign exchange contracts expire in less than three months and all expire within one year.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P9_S1	They will settle primarily in Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, China renminbi, Danish kroner, the Euro, Hungarian forint, Israeli shekel, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.
866374_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Based on our overall currency rate exposures as of March 31, 2014, including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and cash flows, a near-term 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar from its cross-functional rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.

866374_14_ITEM8_P45_S3	The valuation of these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities is subject to further management review and may change materially between the preliminary allocation and end of the purchase price allocation period.
866374_14_ITEM8_P45_S4	Any changes in these estimates may have a material effect on the Company's consolidated operating results or financial position.
866374_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
866374_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors, market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis.
866374_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company has one reporting unit: Electronics Manufacturing Services ("EMS").
866374_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	If the recorded value of the assets, including goodwill, and liabilities ("net book value") of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss may be required to be recognized.
866374_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	Further, to the extent the net book value of the Company as a whole is greater than its fair value in the aggregate, all, or a significant portion of its goodwill may be considered impaired.
866374_14_ITEM8_P47_S3	The Company performed its goodwill impairment assessment on January 31, 2014 and did not elect to perform the qualitative "Step Zero" assessment.
866374_14_ITEM8_P47_S4	Instead the Company performed a quantitative assessment of its goodwill at the afore-mentioned date.
866374_14_ITEM8_P47_S5	Based on this assessment the Company determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test.
866374_14_ITEM8_P47_S6	The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value.
866374_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	The following table summarizes the activity in the Company's goodwill account during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
866374_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	(1) The goodwill generated from the Company's business combinations completed during the years 2014 and 2013 are primarily related to value placed on the employee workforce, service offerings and capabilities and expected synergies.
866374_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.
866374_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	Refer to the discussion of the Company's business acquisitions in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_14_ITEM8_P49_S3	(2) Includes adjustments based on management's estimates resulting from their review and finalization of the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired through certain business combinations completed in a period subsequent to the respective acquisition.
866374_14_ITEM8_P49_S4	These adjustments were not individually, nor in the aggregate, significant to the Company.
866374_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company's acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset may not be recoverable.
866374_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
866374_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	The Company reviewed the carrying value of its intangible assets as of March 31, 2014 and concluded that such amounts continued to be recoverable.
866374_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	Intangible assets are comprised of customer-related intangible assets, which primarily include contractual agreements and customer relationships; and licenses and other intangible assets, which is primarily comprised of licenses and also includes patents and trademarks, and developed technologies.
866374_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	Generally customer-related intangible assets are amortized on an accelerated method based on expected cash flows, primarily over a period of up to eight years.
866374_14_ITEM8_P51_S2	Licenses and other intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over a period of up to seven years.
866374_14_ITEM8_P51_S3	No residual value is estimated for any intangible assets.
866374_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	through business combinations is principally determined based on management's estimates of cash flow and recoverability.
866374_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	The components of acquired intangible assets are as follows:
866374_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	The gross carrying amounts of intangible assets are removed when the recorded amounts have been fully amortized.
866374_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	During fiscal year 2014, the gross carrying amounts of such intangible assets fully amortized and removed totaled $117.9 million.
866374_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	During the year ended March 31, 2014, the Company's customer-related intangible assets, and licenses and other intangible assets increased by $15.8 million and $6.9 million respectively, primarily due to the acquisition of Riwisa AG as further discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_14_ITEM8_P53_S3	Total intangible asset amortization expense recognized in continuing operations during fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $28.9 million, $29.5 million and $49.6 million, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P53_S4	As of March 31, 2014, the weighted-average remaining useful lives of the Company's intangible assets were approximately 2.7 years and 4.1 years for customer-related intangibles, and licenses and other intangible assets, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P53_S5	The estimated future annual amortization expense for acquired intangible assets is as follows:
866374_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	All derivative instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
866374_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	If the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, effectiveness is tested monthly using a regression analysis of the change in the spot currency rates and the change in the present value of the spot currency rates.
866374_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	The spot currency rates are discounted to present value using functional currency LIBOR rates over the maximum length of the hedge period.
866374_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument (excluding time value) is recognized in shareholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the hedged item affects earnings.
866374_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	Ineffective and excluded portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings immediately.
866374_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	derivative instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period.

866374_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company's investments are included as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
866374_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company has certain equity investments in, and notes receivable from, non-publicly traded companies which are included within other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
866374_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	Non-majority-owned investments are accounted for using the equity method when the Company has an ownership percentage equal to or greater than 20% but less than 50%, or has the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer; otherwise the cost method is used.
866374_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	The Company monitors these investments for impairment indicators and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values as required.
866374_14_ITEM8_P60_S3	Fair values of these investments, when required, are estimated using unobservable inputs, primarily discounted cash flow projections.
866374_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	As of March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company's equity investments in non-majority owned companies totaled $77.4 million and $26.8 million, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	The equity in the earnings or losses of the Company's equity method investments was not material to the consolidated results of operations for any period presented and is included in interest and other, net.

866374_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company recognizes restructuring charges related to its plans to close or consolidate excess manufacturing and administrative facilities.
866374_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	In connection with these activities, the Company records restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other exit-related costs.
866374_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	The recognition of restructuring charges requires the Company to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	To the extent the Company's actual results differ from its estimates and assumptions, the Company may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_14_ITEM8_P66_S2	Such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_14_ITEM8_P66_S3	At the end of each reporting period, the Company evaluates the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_14_ITEM8_P66_S4	See note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding restructuring charges.
866374_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance which requires an entity to report a disposal of a component of an entity in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when the component of an entity meets certain criteria to be classified as held for sale when the component of an entity is disposed of by a sale or disposed of other than by a sale.
866374_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	Further, additional disclosures about discontinued operations should include the following for the periods in which the results of operations of the discontinued operations are presented in the statement of operations: the major classes of line items constituting pretax profit or loss of discontinued operations; total operating and investing cash flows of discontinued operations; depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, and significant operating and investing noncash items of discontinued operations; pretax profit or loss attributable to the parent if a discontinued operation includes a non-controlling interest; a reconciliation of major classes of assets, liabilities of the discontinued operation classified as held for sale; and a reconciliation of major classes of line items constituting the pretax profit or loss of the discontinued operation.
866374_14_ITEM8_P67_S2	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2016, and will impact the Company's assessment of any future discontinued operations.
866374_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to present unrecognized tax benefits in the financial statements as a reduction to deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, or tax credit carryforwards.
866374_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	To the extent these are not available at the reporting date, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.
866374_14_ITEM8_P68_S2	This disclosure is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2015, and is not expected to have a significant impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
866374_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements, including the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors, as well as discussion of the nature of such obligations.
866374_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	This disclosure is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2015, and is not expected to have a significant impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
866374_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	During fiscal year 2014, the Company granted equity compensation awards under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan") and the 2013 Elementum Plan (the "Elementum Plan").
866374_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	The 2010 Plan is administered by Flextronics International Ltd., while the Elementum Plan is administered by Elementum SCM (Cayman) Limited, a majority owned subsidiary of the Company.
866374_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	The 2010 Equity Incentive Plan of Flextronics International Ltd.
866374_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	As of March 31, 2014, the Company had approximately 38.1 million shares available for grants under the 2010 Plan.
866374_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	Options issued to employees under the 2010 Plan generally vest over four years and expire seven years from the date of grant.
866374_14_ITEM8_P73_S2	Options granted to non-employee directors expire five years from the date of grant.
866374_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	The exercise price of options granted to employees is determined by the Company's Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and may not be less than the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant.
866374_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company also grants share bonus awards under its equity compensation plan.
866374_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	Share bonus awards are rights to acquire a specified number of ordinary shares for no cash consideration in exchange for continued service with the Company.
866374_14_ITEM8_P75_S2	Share bonus awards generally vest in installments over a three to five year period and unvested share bonus awards are forfeited upon termination of employment.
866374_14_ITEM8_P75_S3	Vesting for certain share bonus awards is contingent upon both service and market conditions.
866374_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense:
866374_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	As required by the authoritative guidance for stock-based compensation, management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.
866374_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary termination behavior as well as an analysis of actual forfeitures.
866374_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.0 year and will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	As of March 31, 2014, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share bonus awards granted to employees was approximately $77.5 million, net of estimated forfeitures.
866374_14_ITEM8_P79_S2	This cost will be amortized generally on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.4 years and will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_14_ITEM8_P79_S3	Approximately $15.0 million of the unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, is related to share bonus awards granted to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting a certain market condition.
866374_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	Cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits (tax benefits related to the excess of proceeds from employee exercises of share options over the share-based compensation cost recognized for those options) are classified as financing cash flows.
866374_14_ITEM8_P80_S1	During fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company did not recognize any excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow.
866374_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share options granted under the 2010 Plan using the Black-Scholes valuation method and a single option award approach.
866374_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
866374_14_ITEM8_P81_S2	The fair market value of share bonus awards granted, other than those awards with a market condition, is the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant and is generally recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.
866374_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	Expected Term The Company's expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation method represents the period that the Company's share options are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share options, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its share options.
866374_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	Expected Volatility The Company's expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes valuation method is derived from a combination of implied volatility related to publicly traded options to purchase Flextronics ordinary shares and historical variability in the Company's periodic share price.
866374_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	Expected Dividend The Company has never paid dividends on its ordinary shares and currently does not intend to do so in the near term, and accordingly, the dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.
866374_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities issued with a term equivalent to the expected term of the option.
866374_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	There were no options granted under the 2010 Plan during fiscal year 2014.
866374_14_ITEM8_P86_S1	The fair value of the Company's share options granted to employees for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	Options granted during the 2013 and 2012 fiscal years had contractual lives of seven years.
866374_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share bonus awards granted under the 2010 Plan whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions using Monte Carlo simulation.
866374_14_ITEM8_P88_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is the service period.
866374_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	Expected volatility of Flextronics Volatility used in Monte Carlo simulation is derived from the historical volatility of Flextronics' stock price over a period equal to the service period of the share bonus awards granted.
866374_14_ITEM8_P89_S1	The service period is three years for those share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, and four years for those share bonus awards granted in fiscal year 2012.
866374_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	Average peer volatility Volatility used in Monte Carlo simulation is derived from the historical volatilities of both the S P 500 index and components of an extended Electronics Manufacturing Services ("EMS") group, comprised of global competitors of the Company within the same industry, for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal year 2014, and historical volatilities of the S P 500 index for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 based on the various service periods.
866374_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	Average Peer Correlation Correlation coefficients were used to model the movement of Flextronics' stock price relative to both the S P 500 index and peers in the extended EMS group for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal 2014, and relative to the S P 500 index for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal 2013 and 2012.
866374_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	Expected Dividend The Company has never paid dividends on its ordinary shares and currently does not intend to do so in the near term, and accordingly, the dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.
866374_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Monte Carlo simulation on the yield of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bills, as of the measurement date.
866374_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	The fair value of the Company's share-bonus awards, whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions, for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	The following is a summary of option activity for the Company's 2010 Plan ("Price" reflects the weighted-average exercise price):
866374_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised (calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying award and the price of the Company's ordinary shares determined as of the time of option exercise for options exercised in-the-money) under the Company's 2010 Plan was $24.7 million, $13.0 million and $17.1 million during fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	Cash received from option exercises was $28.1 million, $22.3 million and $23.1 million for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	The following table presents the composition of options outstanding and exercisable as of March 31, 2014:
866374_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	As of March 31, 2014, the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding, options vested and expected to vest (which includes adjustments for expected forfeitures), and options exercisable were $53.5 million, $53.4 million and $53.0 million, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P99_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company's ordinary shares as of March 31, 2014 for the approximately 10.1 million options that were in-the-money at March 31, 2014.
866374_14_ITEM8_P99_S2	As of March 31, 2014, the weighted average remaining contractual life for options exercisable was 1.49 years.
866374_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's share bonus award activity ("Price" reflects the weighted-average grant-date fair value):
866374_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	Of the 21.8 million unvested share bonus awards outstanding as of the year ended March 31, 2014, approximately 5.1 million represents the target amount of grants made to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions, and are summarized as follows:
866374_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance, the Company will continue to recognize share-based compensation expense for these awards with market conditions regardless of whether such awards will ultimately vest.
866374_14_ITEM8_P102_S1	The first half of the share-bonus awards with market conditions granted in fiscal year 2011 did not vest in June 2013 as the market condition was not met as of that date.
866374_14_ITEM8_P102_S2	Half of the share-bonus awards with market conditions granted during fiscal 2012 and the remainder of the awards granted during fiscal year 2011 will vest in June 2014, and the expected payout percentages are approximately 50% and 75% of the number of shares granted, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	The total intrinsic value of share bonus awards vested under the Company's 2010 Plan was $42.4 million, $9.7 million, and $17.7 million during fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, based on the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date vested.
866374_14_ITEM8_P104_S0	The 2013 Equity Incentive Plan of Elementum SCM (Cayman) Ltd.
866374_14_ITEM8_P105_S0	In November 2013, Elementum SCM (Cayman) Ltd.("Elementum"), a majority owned subsidiary of the Company established its own equity incentive plan (Elementum Plan).
866374_14_ITEM8_P105_S1	During the year ended March 31, 2014, Elementum issued 8.3 million options with an average fair value of $0.19 per option and average exercise price of $0.17 per option to its employees which vest over a period of four years and expire ten years from the grant date.
866374_14_ITEM8_P105_S2	Of these options 1.9 million were cancelled during the fiscal year, and 6.4 million were outstanding at an average exercise price of $0.19 per option.
866374_14_ITEM8_P105_S3	None of the options had been exercised as of March 31, 2014, and Elementum had approximately 6.6 million shares available for future grants under this Plan.
866374_14_ITEM8_P106_S0	The exercise price of the options granted under this Plan are determined by the Board of Directors of Elementum and is based on valuations obtained from a third party service provider for the Elementum common shares as of the date of option grants.
866374_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	Fair value of options granted under this Plan are determined as follows:
866374_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	Valuation and Amortization Method Elementum estimates the fair value of share options granted using the Black-Scholes valuation method and a single option award approach.

866374_14_ITEM8_P165_S0	The accounting guidance for fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.
866374_14_ITEM8_P165_S1	A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
866374_14_ITEM8_P165_S2	The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
866374_14_ITEM8_P166_S0	Level 1 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
866374_14_ITEM8_P167_S0	The Company has deferred compensation plans for its officers and certain other employees.
866374_14_ITEM8_P167_S1	Amounts deferred under the plans are invested in hypothetical investments selected by the participant or the participant's investment manager.
866374_14_ITEM8_P167_S2	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets are included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets and include investments in equity securities that are valued using active market prices.
866374_14_ITEM8_P168_S0	Level 2 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets) such as cash and cash equivalents and money market funds; or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
866374_14_ITEM8_P169_S0	The Company values foreign exchange forward contracts using level 2 observable inputs which primarily consist of an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
866374_14_ITEM8_P170_S0	The Company's cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits and money market funds, which are valued using level 2 inputs, such as interest rates and maturity periods.
866374_14_ITEM8_P170_S1	Due to their short-term nature, their carrying amount approximates fair value.
866374_14_ITEM8_P171_S0	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets also include money market funds, mutual funds, corporate and government bonds and certain convertible securities that are valued using prices obtained from various pricing sources.
866374_14_ITEM8_P171_S1	These sources price these investments using certain market indices and the performance of these investments in relation to these indices.
866374_14_ITEM8_P171_S2	As a result, the Company has classified these investments as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
866374_14_ITEM8_P172_S0	Level 3 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
866374_14_ITEM8_P173_S0	The Company has accrued for contingent consideration in connection with its business acquisitions, which is measured at fair value based on certain internal models and inputs.
866374_14_ITEM8_P173_S1	The following table summarizes the activities related to contingent consideration:
866374_14_ITEM8_P174_S0	The Company values deferred purchase price receivables relating to its Asset-Backed Securitization Program based on a discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable inputs (i.e. level 3 inputs), which are primarily risk free interest rates adjusted for the credit quality of the underlying creditor.
866374_14_ITEM8_P174_S1	Due to its high credit quality and short term maturity, their fair value approximates carrying value.
866374_14_ITEM8_P175_S0	increases in either of the significant unobservable inputs (credit spread or risk free interest rate) in isolation would result in lower fair value estimates, however the impact is insignificant.
866374_14_ITEM8_P175_S1	The interrelationship between these inputs is also insignificant.
866374_14_ITEM8_P175_S2	Refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the change in the deferred purchase price receivable.
866374_14_ITEM8_P176_S0	As of March 31, 2013, the Company had warrants to purchase up to 1.35 million shares of common stock of a certain supplier at a weighted-average price of $7.33 per share.
866374_14_ITEM8_P176_S1	The warrants were to expire on May 18, 2018.
866374_14_ITEM8_P176_S2	These fully vested warrants, which were derivative instruments, were fair valued at each reporting date with gains or losses from changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_14_ITEM8_P176_S3	The Company valued these warrants based on the Black-Scholes option-valuation model using unobservable inputs classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
866374_14_ITEM8_P176_S4	Significant changes in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation would have resulted in a change in the fair value estimate, but in each case, the amount would have been insignificant.
866374_14_ITEM8_P176_S5	The interrelationship between these inputs was also insignificant.
866374_14_ITEM8_P176_S6	As of March 31, 2013, the Company used the following assumptions to value these warrants:
866374_14_ITEM8_P177_S0	During fiscal year 2014 these warrants were exercised and the underlying shares were sold.
866374_14_ITEM8_P178_S0	The following table summarizes the changes in the fair value of these warrants:
866374_14_ITEM8_P179_S0	There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy during fiscal years 2014 and 2013.
866374_14_ITEM8_P180_S0	The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2014 and 2013:
866374_14_ITEM8_P181_S0	The Company has certain long-lived assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, and are as follows:
866374_14_ITEM8_P182_S0	Assets held for sale are recorded at the lesser of the carrying value or fair value, which is based on comparable sales from prevailing market data (level 2 inputs).
866374_14_ITEM8_P182_S1	These assets primarily represent manufacturing facilities that have been closed as part of the Company's historical facility consolidations and that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
866374_14_ITEM8_P182_S2	During fiscal year 2014, the Company transferred $59.4 million of assets to held for sale, and expects to sell these within a period of twelve months.
866374_14_ITEM8_P182_S3	Disposals of assets held for sale totaled $24.5 million during fiscal year 2014, which resulted in a gain of $9.2 million, and was included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations.
866374_14_ITEM8_P182_S4	Impairment charges during fiscal year 2014 were not significant for assets that were no longer in use and held for sale.
866374_14_ITEM8_P182_S5	No impairment charges were recorded for assets held for sale during fiscal year 2013.
866374_14_ITEM8_P183_S0	During the fiscal year 2013, the Company recognized impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets held and used since the carrying value of such assets exceeded the fair value, based on the sales of comparable assets, as a result of its restructuring activities as further discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_14_ITEM8_P184_S0	There were no material fair value adjustments or other transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy for these long-lived assets during the fiscal years 2014 and 2013.
866374_14_ITEM8_P185_S0	The following table presents the Company's liabilities not carried at fair value as at March 31, 2014 and 2013:
866374_14_ITEM8_P186_S0	The term loans and Notes due February 2020 and February 2023 are valued based on broker trading prices in active markets.
866374_14_ITEM8_P187_S0	Asia term loans The Company's Asia Term Loans were not traded publicly; however, as the pricing, maturity and other pertinent terms of these loans closely approximate those of the Term Loans due October 2014 and March 2019, management estimates the respective trading prices would be approximately the same.
866374_14_ITEM8_P188_S0	As of March 31, 2014 and 2013, the gross carrying amount and associated accumulated depreciation of the Company's property and equipment financed under capital leases, and the related obligations was not material.
866374_14_ITEM8_P189_S0	These operating leases expire in various years through 2028 and require the following minimum lease payments:
866374_14_ITEM8_P190_S0	Total rent expense amounted to $150.1 million, $138.8 million and $160.5 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P191_S0	As part of an existing manufacturing agreement with a customer, the Company is obligated to reimburse the customer for certain performance provisions as defined in the contract.
866374_14_ITEM8_P191_S1	Also defined in the contract are certain provisions that would allow the Company to recover these losses in future periods.
866374_14_ITEM8_P191_S2	The maximum commitment under this arrangement was initially $88.0 million and declines as the Company manufactures and delivers products under the arrangement, which expires in August 2016.
866374_14_ITEM8_P191_S3	As of March 31, 2014, per the terms of the agreement, and in conjunction with negotiations with the customer during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the contractual obligation for reimbursement was determined to be probable and accordingly the Company recorded $55.0 million to other charges (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_14_ITEM8_P191_S4	Reimbursement is not payable until August 2016 or upon contract termination and as a result is included in other liabilities.
866374_14_ITEM8_P191_S5	The Company and the customer are finalizing an amendment to this agreement that includes a waiver of the $55.0 million contractual obligation.
866374_14_ITEM8_P191_S6	Upon the execution of the amendment, if the contractual obligation is waived, the Company will reverse this charge with a corresponding credit to other income in the period the amendment is executed.
866374_14_ITEM8_P192_S0	The Company valued the contractual obligation as of March 31, 2014 based on the performance provisions defined in the contract (i.e. level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy).
866374_14_ITEM8_P193_S0	On December 11, 2013, Xilinx, Inc. (plaintiff) filed a lawsuit in Santa Clara County, California, Superior Court against Flextronics International Ltd.; Flextronics International USA, Inc.; and Flextronics Corporation (Case No. 113CV257431).
866374_14_ITEM8_P193_S1	The complaint asserts various claims, including fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and unfair competition, based on specific alleged incidents concerning our purchases and sales of Xilinx products.
866374_14_ITEM8_P193_S2	The plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory, statutory, punitive, and other forms of damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees and costs.
866374_14_ITEM8_P193_S3	The plaintiff also seeks a jury trial.
866374_14_ITEM8_P194_S0	Although the outcome of this matter is currently not determinable, management expects that any losses that are probable or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of this matter, which are in excess of amounts already accrued in its consolidated balance sheets, would not be material to the financial statements as a whole.
866374_14_ITEM8_P195_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received an assessment for certain sales and import taxes.
866374_14_ITEM8_P195_S1	The tax assessment notice is for nine months of calendar year 2010.
866374_14_ITEM8_P195_S2	This assessment is currently being reviewed at an administrative level, and we plan to vigorously oppose it as well as any future assessments.
866374_14_ITEM8_P195_S3	We are, however, unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of these assessments against our Brazilian subsidiary.
866374_14_ITEM8_P195_S4	While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liabilities, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the administrative-review and judicial processes in Brazil and the nature of the claims, we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any.
866374_14_ITEM8_P195_S5	We do not expect final judicial determination on these claims for several years.
866374_14_ITEM8_P196_S0	In addition, from time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
866374_14_ITEM8_P196_S1	We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims.
866374_14_ITEM8_P196_S2	Although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management expects that any losses that are probable or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of these matters, which are in excess of amounts already accrued in its consolidated balance sheet, would not be material to the financial statements as a whole.
866374_14_ITEM8_P197_S0	The domestic (Singapore) and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes were comprised of the following:
866374_14_ITEM8_P198_S0	The provision for income taxes from continuing operations consisted of the following:
866374_14_ITEM8_P199_S0	The domestic statutory income tax rate was approximately 17.0% in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012.
866374_14_ITEM8_P199_S1	The reconciliation of the income tax expense from continuing operations expected based on domestic statutory income tax rates to the expense for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows:
866374_14_ITEM8_P200_S0	A number of countries in which the Company is located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business.
866374_14_ITEM8_P200_S1	In general, these holidays were secured based on the nature, size and location of the Company's operations.
866374_14_ITEM8_P200_S2	The aggregate dollar effect on the Company's income resulting from tax holidays and tax incentives to attract and retain business for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $15.2 million, $22.6 million and $41.8 million, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P200_S3	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share was $0.02 and $0.02, and the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 were $0.03 and $0.03, and $0.06 and $0.06, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P201_S0	Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, the Company's existing holidays will expire in the fiscal years ending March 31, 2015 through fiscal year 2022.
866374_14_ITEM8_P202_S0	Under its territorial tax system, Singapore generally does not tax foreign sourced income until repatriated to Singapore.
866374_14_ITEM8_P202_S1	The Company has included the effects of Singapore's territorial tax system in the rate differential line above.
866374_14_ITEM8_P202_S2	The tax effect of foreign income not repatriated to Singapore for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $51.5 million, $26.7 million and $17.7 million, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P203_S0	The components of deferred income taxes are as follows:
866374_14_ITEM8_P204_S0	Utilization of the Company's deferred tax assets is limited by the future earnings of the Company in the tax jurisdictions in which such deferred assets arose.
866374_14_ITEM8_P204_S1	As a result, management is uncertain as to when or whether these operations will generate sufficient profit to realize any benefit from the deferred tax assets.
866374_14_ITEM8_P205_S0	The valuation allowance provides a reserve against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized by the Company.
866374_14_ITEM8_P205_S1	However, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize certain of these benefits and, accordingly, has recognized a deferred tax asset from these benefits.
866374_14_ITEM8_P205_S2	The change in valuation allowance is net of certain increases and decreases to prior year losses and other carryforwards that have no current impact on the tax provision.
866374_14_ITEM8_P205_S3	Approximately $34.0 million of the valuation allowance relates to income tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options, which if realized will be credited directly to shareholders' equity and will not be available to benefit the income tax provision in any future period.
866374_14_ITEM8_P206_S0	$46.0 million of the deferred tax assets.
866374_14_ITEM8_P206_S1	These tax losses and other carryforwards, on a tax return basis, will expire at various dates as follows:
866374_14_ITEM8_P207_S0	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced or increased in the near-term if facts, including the amount of taxable income or the mix of taxable income between subsidiaries, differ from management's estimates.
866374_14_ITEM8_P208_S0	The Company does not provide for income taxes on approximately $779.0 million of undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of Singapore as management has plans for the use of such earnings to fund certain activities outside of Singapore.
866374_14_ITEM8_P208_S1	Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
866374_14_ITEM8_P209_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
866374_14_ITEM8_P210_S0	The Company's unrecognized tax benefits are subject to change over the next twelve months primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and as audits are settled.
866374_14_ITEM8_P210_S1	The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by an estimated range of $18 million to $37 million within the next twelve months primarily due to potential settlements of various audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.
866374_14_ITEM8_P211_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file federal, state, and local income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions around the world.
866374_14_ITEM8_P211_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003.
866374_14_ITEM8_P212_S0	Of the $243.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2014, $166.3 million will affect the annual effective tax rate if the benefits are eventually recognized.
866374_14_ITEM8_P212_S1	The amount that does not impact the effective tax rate relates to positions that would be settled with a tax loss carryforward previously subject to a valuation allowance.
866374_14_ITEM8_P213_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within the Company's tax expense.
866374_14_ITEM8_P213_S1	During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately $8.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P213_S2	The Company had approximately $15.6 million and $11.9 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
866374_14_ITEM8_P214_S0	The Company initiated certain restructuring activities during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 intended to improve its operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce and capacity and realign the corporate cost structure.

866374_14_ITEM8_P215_S0	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, the Company recognized restructuring charges of approximately $75.3 million.
866374_14_ITEM8_P215_S1	The costs associated with these restructuring activities include employee severance, other personnel costs, non-cash impairment charges on equipment no longer in use and to be disposed of, and other exit related costs due to facility closures or rationalizations.
866374_14_ITEM8_P215_S2	Pre-tax restructuring charges comprised $73.4 million of cash charges predominantly related to employee severance and $1.9 million of non-cash charges related to impairment of long-lived assets.
866374_14_ITEM8_P215_S3	Employee severance costs were associated with the terminations of 6,758 identified employees.

866374_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Flextronics International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	As described in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Google's Motorola Mobility LLC, which was acquired on April 16, 2013 and Riwisa AG, which was acquired on November 4, 2013, whose financial statements in aggregate constitute 10.9% of total assets and 11.6% of net sales of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended March 31, 2014.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Google's Motorola Mobility LLC and Riwisa AG.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P6_S3	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P6_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
866374_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P7_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P10_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
866374_14_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2014 of the Company and our report dated May 20, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

866374_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	As of March 31, 2015 the above described business groups comprised our reportable segments.
866374_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	We provide our advanced design, manufacturing and supply chain services through a network of over 100 facilities in approximately 30 countries across four continents.
866374_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	We have established this extensive network of design and manufacturing facilities in the world's major consumer electronics and industrial products markets (Asia, the Americas, and Europe) in order to serve the outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	Our services increase our customers' competitiveness by delivering improved product quality, increased flexibility, leading manufacturability, improved performance, faster time-to-market and competitive costs.
866374_15_ITEM1_P3_S3	Our OEM customers leverage our services to meet their requirements throughout their products' entire life cycles.
866374_15_ITEM1_P3_S4	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, we had revenue of $26.1 billion and net income of $600.8 million.

866374_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our business has been subject to seasonality, primarily due to our mobile devices and consumer electronics market exposures, which are part of our CTG business group, which historically exhibit particular strength generally in the two quarters leading up to the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our expertise is in the design, manufacturing, and supply services for a broad range of products; as such, the closest definition of our industry is the outsourcing Electronics Manufacturing Services ("EMS") industry.
866374_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	EMS has experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elect to outsource some or all of their design, manufacturing, and after-market services requirements.
866374_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	In recent years, we have seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, primarily in the technology sector.

866374_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	We combine our design and manufacturing services to provide sketch to scale customized solutions that include services from design concept, through product industrialization and product development, including the manufacture of components and complete products (such as smart phones), which are then sold by our OEM customers under the OEMs' brand names.
866374_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	Geographic, Customer and End Market Diversification .
866374_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	We believe we have created a well-diversified and balanced company.
866374_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	We have diversified our business across multiple end markets, significantly expanding our total available market.
866374_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	The world is experiencing rapid changes and macro-economic disruptions have led to demand shifts and realignments.
866374_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	We believe that we are well-positioned through our market diversification to grow faster than the industry average and successfully navigate through difficult economic climates.
866374_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	Our broad geographic footprint and experiences with multiple product types and complexity levels creates a significant competitive advantage.
866374_15_ITEM1_P62_S3	We continually look for new ways to diversify our offering within each market segment.
866374_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	We have established state-of-the art innovation centers in the Americas, Asia and Europe, with differentiated offerings and specialized services and focus.
866374_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	Some of these offerings include the most advanced 3D plastic printing, 3D metal printing, surface mount technology (SMT), and X-ray and test equipment to support major industries in bringing innovative products to market rapidly.
866374_15_ITEM1_P63_S2	We also have a reliability and failure analysis lab and an automation applications team.
866374_15_ITEM1_P63_S3	Another key feature is our focus on confidentiality and security as we offer dedicated customer-confidential work spaces that include increased security and restricted access to protect our OEM customers' intellectual property ("IP") and the confidentiality of new products being launched into the marketplace.
866374_15_ITEM1_P63_S4	These innovation centers offer our customers a geographically-focused version of our sketch to scale services, taking their product from concept to volume production and go-to-market in a rapid, cost effective and low risk manner.
866374_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Industrial Parks; Low-Cost Manufacturing Services .
866374_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	We have developed self-contained campuses that co-locate our manufacturing and logistics operations with our suppliers at a single, low-cost location.
866374_15_ITEM1_P64_S2	These industrial parks enhance our supply chain management efficiency, while providing a low-cost, multi-technology solution for our customers.
866374_15_ITEM1_P64_S3	This approach increases the competitiveness of our customers by reducing logistical barriers and costs, improving communications, increasing flexibility, lowering transportation costs and reducing turnaround times.
866374_15_ITEM1_P64_S4	We have strategically established our industrial parks in Brazil, China, Hungary, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and the Ukraine.
866374_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	We have certain of our manufacturing operations situated in low-cost regions of the world to provide our customers with a wide array of manufacturing solutions and low manufacturing costs.
866374_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	locations, such as Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and the Ukraine.
866374_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	We believe we are a global industry leader in low-cost production capabilities.
866374_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our customers include many of the world's leading technology companies.
866374_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	We have focused on establishing long-term relationships with our customers and have been successful in expanding our relationships to incorporate additional product lines and services.
866374_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	In fiscal year 2015, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 50% of net sales.
866374_15_ITEM1_P68_S3	Only Motorola Mobility (including net sales from its parent Google up to the point in time when Motorola Mobility was acquired by Lenovo and including net sales from Lenovo thereafter), a customer in our CTG business group, accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's net sales in fiscal year 2015.
866374_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	The following table lists in alphabetical order a sample of our largest customers in fiscal year 2015 and the end products of those customers for which we provide design, manufacturing and/or after-market services:
866374_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	Although we obtain firm purchase orders from our customers, OEM customers typically do not make firm orders for delivery of products more than 30 to 90 days in advance.
866374_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	In addition, OEM customers may reschedule or cancel firm orders depending on contractual arrangements.
866374_15_ITEM1_P70_S2	Therefore, we do not believe that the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales.
866374_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our market is extremely competitive and includes many companies, several of which have achieved substantial market share.
866374_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	We compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturing service providers, as well as our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	We compete with different companies depending on the type of service we are providing or the geographic area in which an activity takes place.
866374_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the manufacturing services market are quality and range of services, design and technological capabilities; cost; location of facilities; responsiveness and flexibility.
866374_15_ITEM1_P73_S2	We believe we are extremely competitive with regard to all of these factors.
866374_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR") practices framework has several elements, including environmental compliance, labor and human rights, ethics, governance, and community engagement.
866374_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	Flextronics' CSR framework is based upon the principles, policies, and standards prescribed by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition ("EICC"), a worldwide association of electronics companies committed to promoting an industry code of conduct for global electronics supply chains to improve working and environmental conditions as well as other relevant international standards (e.g. ISO 14001).
866374_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	Flextronics is a founding member of the EICC.
866374_15_ITEM1_P74_S3	Social responsibility is also an area of increasing regulation, with specific regulations such as the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation on Human Trafficking and the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015 creating new compliance and disclosure obligations for the Company and for our customers.
866374_15_ITEM1_P74_S4	We accordingly operate a number of programs, including compliance audits and compliance capability building programs that focus on driving continuous improvements in social, ethical, and environmental compliance throughout all of our global operating units, all in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
866374_15_ITEM1_P74_S5	As a guide to achieving this end, Flextronics looks at principles, policies, and standards as prescribed by the EICC.
866374_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	Being a good corporate citizen does not mean we should merely conform to standards.
866374_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	We go beyond required responsibilities by offering a wide range of programs and initiatives to engage both our internal and external communities.
866374_15_ITEM1_P75_S2	At the heart of this endeavor lies our pragmatic goal of positively influencing the lives of people in the communities in which we operate.
866374_15_ITEM1_P75_S3	We intend to continue investing in these global communities through grant-making, financial contributions, volunteer work, direct engagement and donation of resources.
866374_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), Section 1502, introduced reporting requirements related to the verification of whether Flextronics is directly (or indirectly through suppliers of materials) purchasing the following minerals: columbite-tantalite, also known as coltan (the metal ore from which tantalum is extracted); cassiterite (the metal ore from which tin is extracted); gold; wolframite (the metal ore from which tungsten is extracted); or their derivatives; or any other mineral or its derivatives as determined by the Secretary of State with financing conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country.
866374_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	Flextronics is working directly with suppliers, industry groups, and customers to comply with the due diligence reporting requirements necessary to comply with the new law.
866374_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
866374_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	We have fully implemented processes and procedures to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.
866374_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third-party sites.
866374_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	We engage environmental consulting firms to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities of our ongoing operations, historical disposal activities and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements.
866374_15_ITEM1_P78_S2	We determine the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the probability of occurrence and the reasonable possibility of incurring costs in light of information currently available.
866374_15_ITEM1_P78_S3	The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations, the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by us at our operating facilities, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters.
866374_15_ITEM1_P78_S4	There can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known.
866374_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_15_ITEM1_P79_S1	EU Directive REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals"), and China RoHS entitled, Management Methods for Controlling Pollution for Electronic Information Products ("EIPs").
866374_15_ITEM1_P79_S2	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States.
866374_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	Our business requires close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to mitigate risk of non-compliance.
866374_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as the regulations.
866374_15_ITEM1_P80_S2	These programs vary from collecting compliance or material data from our Flextronics owned suppliers to full laboratory testing, and we require our supply chain to comply.
866374_15_ITEM1_P80_S3	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	In the case of WEEE, although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations.
866374_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	New technical classifications of e-Waste being discussed in the Basel Convention technical working group could affect both Flextronics and Flextronics' customers' abilities and obligations in electronics repair and refurbishment.
866374_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	Flextronics continues to monitor these discussions and is working with our customers and other technical organizations to minimize the impact to legal and responsibly managed repair operations.
866374_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	As of March 31, 2015, our global workforce totaled approximately 150,000 permanent employees.
866374_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by work councils.
866374_15_ITEM1_P83_S2	We have never experienced a significant work stoppage or strike, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
866374_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees.
866374_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	The loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business, results of operations and business prospects.
866374_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel.
866374_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	We own or license various United States and foreign patents relating to a variety of technologies.
866374_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	For certain of our proprietary processes, we rely on trade secret protection.
866374_15_ITEM1_P85_S2	We also have registered our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the United States and other countries throughout the world.
866374_15_ITEM1_P85_S3	As of March 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying value of our intellectual property was not material.
866374_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	Although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it, from time to time third parties do assert patent infringement claims against us or our customers.
866374_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	In addition, we provide design and engineering services to our customers and also design and make our own products.
866374_15_ITEM1_P86_S2	As a consequence of these activities, our customers are requiring us to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses.
866374_15_ITEM1_P86_S3	If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_15_ITEM1_P86_S4	Such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor.
866374_15_ITEM1_P86_S5	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome.
866374_15_ITEM1_P86_S6	We also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services.
866374_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	Refer to note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for financial information about our geographic areas.
866374_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	We make available through our Internet website the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
866374_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	We were incorporated in the Republic of Singapore in May 1990.
866374_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	Our principal corporate office is located at 2 Changi South Lane, Singapore 486123.
866374_15_ITEM1_P89_S2	Our U.S. corporate headquarters is located at 6201 America Center Drive, San Jose, CA, 95002.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We depend on industries that continually produce technologically advanced products with short product life cycles and our business would be adversely affected if our customers' products are not successful or if our customers lose market share.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We derive our revenues from customers in the following business groups:
866374_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	IEI, which is comprised of our semiconductor and capital equipment, office solutions, test and measurement, household industrial and lifestyle, industrial automation and kiosks, energy and metering, and lighting; and INS, which includes radio access base stations, remote radio heads (RRH) and small cells for wireless infrastructure, optical, routing, broadcasting and switching products for the data and video network, server and storage platforms for both enterprise and cloud based deployments, next generation storage and security appliance products and rack level solutions, converged infrastructure and software defined product solutions.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Factors affecting any of these industries in general or our customers in particular, could adversely impact us.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	rapid changes in technology, evolving industry standards and requirements for continuous improvement in products and services result in short product life cycles; demand for our customers' products may be seasonal; our customers may fail to successfully market their products, and our customers' products may fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance; our customers may experience dramatic market share shifts in demand which may cause them to lose market share or exit the business; and there may be recessionary periods in our customers' markets, such as the recent global economic downturn.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and our current and potential customers may decide to manufacture some or all of their products internally, which could harm our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers have harmed, and may in the future harm, our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and deliver for these customers, by causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and by lowering our asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Additionally, current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our capabilities against other providers as well as against the merits of manufacturing products themselves.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our business would be adversely affected if OEMs decide to perform these functions internally or transfer their business to another provider.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, we face competition from the manufacturing operations of some of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In the past, some of our customers moved a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Any of these developments could cause a decline in our sales, loss of market acceptance of our products or services, compression of our profits or loss of our market share.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	As a provider of design and manufacturing services and components for electronics, we must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround time for our customers.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and we often experience reduced lead times in customer orders which may be less than the lead time we require to procure necessary components and materials.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of our customers.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	will seek and accept, setting production schedules, making component procurement commitments, and allocating personnel and other resources, based on our estimates of our customers' requirements.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production or require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to reduce costs or achieve other objectives.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	These demands stress our resources and reduce our margins.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands, and transfers from one facility to another can result in inefficiencies and costs due to excess capacity in one facility and corresponding capacity constraints at another.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Due to many of our costs and operating expenses being relatively fixed, customer order fluctuations, deferrals and transfers of demand from one facility to another, as described above, have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past and we may experience such effects in the future.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our industry is extremely competitive; if we are not able to continue to provide competitive services, we may lose business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We compete with a number of different companies, depending on the type of service we provide or the location of our operations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	For example, we compete with major global EMS providers, other smaller EMS companies that have a regional or product-specific focus and ODMs with respect to some of the services that we provide.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We also compete with our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our industry is extremely competitive, many of our competitors have achieved substantial market share, and some may have lower cost structures or greater design, manufacturing, financial or other resources than we do.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We face particular competition from Asian-based competitors, including Taiwanese ODM suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If we are unable to provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at lower cost than the other companies in our market, our net sales could decline.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a decline in sales to any of these customers could adversely affect our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Sales to our ten largest customers represent a significant percentage of our net sales.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 50%, 52% and 47% of net sales in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Only Motorola Mobility (including net sales from its parent Google up to the point in time when Motorola Mobility was acquired by Lenovo and including net sales from Lenovo thereafter), which is reflected in our CTG business group, accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	No customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's net sales in fiscal year 2013.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our principal customers have varied from year to year.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	These customers may experience dramatic declines in their market shares or competitive position, due to economic or other forces, that may cause them to reduce their purchases from us or, in some cases, result in the termination of their relationship with us.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Significant reductions in sales to any of these customers, or the loss of major customers, would materially harm our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If we are not able to timely replace expired, canceled or reduced contracts with new business, our revenues and profitability could be harmed.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our components business is dependent on our ability to quickly launch world-class components products, and our investment in the development of our component capabilities, together with the start-up and integration costs necessary to achieve quick launches of world-class components products, may adversely affect our margins and profitability.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our components business, which includes rigid and flexible printed circuit board fabrication, and power supply manufacturing, is part of our strategy to improve our competitive position and to grow our future margins, profitability and shareholder returns by expanding our capabilities.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	our components business is dependent on our ability to design and introduce world- class components that have performance characteristics which are suitable for a broad market and that offer significant price and/or performance advantages over competitive products.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	To create these world class components offerings, we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our components capabilities, in resources such as research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, facility expansions and personnel requirements.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We may not be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance for any of our components offerings in any of our current or target markets.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The success of our components business will also depend upon the level of market acceptance of our customers' end products, which incorporate our components, and over which we have no control.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition, OEMs often require unique configurations or custom designs, which must be developed and integrated in the OEM's product well before the OEM launches the product.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Thus, there is often substantial lead-time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized component and the commencement of volume shipments of the component to the OEM.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	As a result, we may make substantial investments in the development and customization of products for our customers, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not accept the customized component.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Even if our customers accept the customized component, if our customers do not purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our achievement of anticipated levels of profitability in our components business is also dependent on our ability to achieve efficiencies in our manufacturing as well as to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our OEM customers.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability in our components business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If some of our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our products from these customers could decline.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty we could have difficulty sourcing supply necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivable are outstanding.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may be adversely affected by shortages of required electronic components.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	From time to time, we have experienced shortages of some of the electronic components that we use.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	These shortages can result from strong demand for those components or from problems experienced by suppliers, such as shortages of raw materials.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	These unanticipated component shortages could result in curtailed production or delays in production, which may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a reduction in sales, increase in inventory levels and costs, and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Component shortages may also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	shortages could adversely affect our operating results.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to incorporate changes in component costs into the selling prices for our products.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our supply chain may also be impacted by other events outside our control, including macro-economic events, political crises or natural or environmental occurrences.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our margins and profitability may be adversely affected due to substantial investments, start-up and production ramping costs in our design services.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	As part of our strategy to enhance our end-to-end service offerings, we continue to expand our design and engineering capabilities.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Providing these services can expose us to different or greater potential risks than those we face when providing our manufacturing services.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Although we enter into contracts with our design services customers, we may design and develop products for these customers prior to receiving a purchase order or other firm commitment from them.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We are required to make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Even if our customers accept our designs, if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Our design activities often require that we purchase inventory for initial production runs before we have a purchase commitment from a customer.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Even after we have a contract with a customer with respect to a product, these contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any particular volume of purchases.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P30_S5	These contracts can generally be terminated on short notice.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P30_S6	In addition, some of the products we design and develop must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some must receive government certifications.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P30_S7	If we fail to obtain these approvals or certifications on a timely basis, we would be unable to sell these products, which would harm our sales, profitability and reputation.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Due to the increased risks associated with our design services offerings, we may not be able to achieve a high enough level of sales for this business, and the significant investments in research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, patent applications, facility expansion and recruitment that it requires, to be profitable.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The initial costs of investing in the resources necessary to expand our design and engineering capabilities, and in particular to support our design services offerings, have historically adversely affected our profitability, and may continue to do so as we continue to make investments in these capabilities.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In addition, we agree to certain product price limitations and cost reduction targets in connection with these services.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Inflationary and other increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor required to produce the products have occurred and may recur from time to time.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Also, the production ramps for these programs are typically significant and negatively impact our margin in early stages as the manufacturing volumes are lower and result in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	We may not be able to reduce costs, incorporate changes in costs into the selling prices of our products, or increase operating efficiencies as we ramp production of our products, which would adversely affect our margins and our results of operations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to the risks inherent in international operations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The distances between the Americas, Asia and Europe create a number of logistical and communications challenges for us.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	These challenges include managing operations across multiple time zones, directing the manufacture and delivery of products across distances, coordinating procurement of components and raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations, and coordinating the activities and decisions of the core management team, which is based in a number of different countries.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Facilities in several different locations may be involved at different stages of the production process of a single product, leading to additional logistical difficulties.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Because our manufacturing operations are located in a number of countries throughout the Americas, Asia and Europe, we are subject to risks of changes in economic and political conditions in those countries, including:
866374_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	fluctuations in the value of local currencies; labor unrest, difficulties in staffing and geographic labor shortages; longer payment cycles; cultural differences; increases in duties and taxation levied on our products; increased scrutiny by the media and other third parties of labor practices within our industry (including but not limited to working conditions) which may result in allegations of violations, more stringent and burdensome labor laws and regulations and inconsistency in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations, higher labor costs, and/or loss of revenues if our customers become dissatisfied with our labor practices and diminish or terminate their relationship with us; imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds; limitations on imports or exports of components or assembled products, or other travel restrictions; expropriation of private enterprises; exposure to infectious disease and epidemics; political unrest; and a potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The attractiveness of our services to U.S. customers can be affected by changes in U.S. trade policies, such as most favored nation status and trade preferences for some Asian countries.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In addition, some countries in which we operate, such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Mexico, Malaysia and Poland, have experienced periods of slow or negative growth, high inflation, significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Furthermore, in countries such as China, Brazil and Mexico, governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy, and their actions could have a significant effect on us.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure, including lack of adequate power and water supplies, transportation, raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	In addition, we may encounter labor disruptions and rising labor costs, in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Any increase in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In some countries, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert our cash distributions to U.S. dollars or other freely convertible currencies, or to move funds from our accounts in these countries.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Furthermore, the central bank of any of these countries may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to approve distributions to foreign investors.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The success of certain of our activities depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We retain certain intellectual property rights to some of the technologies that we develop as part of our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The measures we have taken to prevent unauthorized use of our technology may not be successful.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties, as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our customers.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In addition, our customers are increasingly requiring us to indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	In the event of such an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If our IT or physical security systems are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information systems.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and inventory and protecting our customers' and our suppliers' confidential information.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools; We are subject to, and at times have suffered from, breach of these security systems which have in the past and may in the future result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or unauthorized use or theft of the inventory or information we are trying to protect.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If unauthorized parties gain physical access to our inventory or if they gain electronic access to our information systems or if such information or inventory is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information or inventory could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties including our customers and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information or inventory, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P45_S4	We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from the breach of our security systems.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	If our compliance policies are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We have implemented local and global compliance policies to ensure compliance with our legal obligations across our operations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our Code of Business Conduct prohibits corrupt payments on a global basis and precludes us from offering or giving anything of value to a government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, to win a business advantage or to improperly influence a decision regarding Flextronics.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents will refrain from taking actions in violation of this and our related anti-corruption policies and procedures.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We are subject to risks relating to litigation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	From time to time, we are involved in various claims, suits, investigations and legal proceedings.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Additional legal claims or regulatory matters may arise in the future and could involve matters relating to commercial disputes, government regulatory and compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax, employment or shareholder issues, product liability claims and other issues on a global basis.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be both time- consuming and disruptive to our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	The defense and ultimate outcome of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operating expenses and a decrease in operating margin, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of "conflict minerals" may result in increased costs and risks to us.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals ("Minerals"), which may be mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	In May 2014, we filed our initial report on Form SD to report that our products were "DRC Conflict Undeterminable" based on our diligence review.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We expect to undertake further diligence of our supply chain in 2015 and beyond as we will have to publicly disclose whether the products we sell contain these Minerals and have and may continue to incur significant costs related to implement a process that will meet the mandates of the Act.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Additionally, customers rely on us to provide critical data regarding the products they purchase and will likely request information on such Minerals.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Our materials sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and we may not be able to easily verify the origins of the Minerals used in the products we sell.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P53_S4	We have many suppliers and each may provide the required information in a different manner, if at all.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, our reputation may suffer if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the Minerals, if any, used in our products.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of any Minerals originating in the specified countries.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P53_S7	The implementation of this requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from our suppliers.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P53_S8	This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide products and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for medical devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	As a medical device manufacturer, we have additional compliance requirements.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We are required to register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring by the FDA.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	FDA, the FDA may take action against us.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	FDA actions may include issuing a letter of inspectional observations, issuing a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the Company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, refusing requests for clearance or approval of new products or withdrawal of clearance or approval previously granted, issuing an import detention on products entering the U.S. from an offshore facility, or shutting down a manufacturing facility.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In the European Union ("EU"), we are required to maintain certain standardized certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections to obtain and maintain these certifications.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Continued noncompliance to the EU regulations could stop the flow of products into the EU from us or from our customers.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In China, the Safe Food and Drug Administration controls and regulates the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We must comply with the regulatory laws applicable to medical device manufactures or our ability to manufacture products in China could be impacted.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	In Japan, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws regulate the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	These regulations also require that subcontractors manufacturing products intended for sale in Japan register with authorities and submit to regulatory audits.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Other Asian countries where we operate have similar laws regarding the regulation of medical device manufacturing.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are subject to the risk of increased income taxes.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Our continued ability to qualify for specific tax holiday extensions will depend on, among other things, our anticipated investment and expansion in these countries and the manner in which the local governments interpret the requirements for modifications, extensions or new incentives.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions around the world.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P63_S2	However, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax provision, operating results, financial position and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	If our products or components contain defects, demand for our services may decline and we may be exposed to product liability and product warranty liability.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation and expose us to product liability or product warranty claims.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Product liability claims may include liability for personal injury or property damage.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Product warranty claims may include liability to pay for the recall, repair or replacement of a product or component.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	allocated liability to our customers, our customers may not have the resources to satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product or component for which they have assumed responsibility.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If we design, engineer or manufacture a product or component that is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could spend a significant amount of money to resolve the claim.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In addition, product liability and product recall insurance coverage are expensive and may not be available for some or all of our services offerings on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P68_S2	A successful product liability or product warranty claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied, limited or is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our failure to comply with environmental laws could adversely affect our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including regulations governing the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used in our manufacturing processes.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the recyclability of products, the materials that may be included in products, and our obligations to dispose of these products after end users have finished with them.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Additionally, we may be exposed to liability to our customers relating to the materials that may be included in the components that we procure for our customers' products.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Any violation or alleged violation by us of environmental laws could subject us to significant costs, fines or other penalties.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of global and local product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P71_S1	We are subject to the EU directives, including the Restrictions on RoHS, the WEEE as well as the EU's REACH regulation.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P71_S2	In addition, new technical classifications of e-Waste being discussed in the Basel Convention technical working group could affect both our customers' abilities and obligations in electronics repair and refurbishment.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Also of note is China's Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by EIPs regulation, commonly referred to as "China RoHS", which restricts the importation into and production within China of electrical equipment containing certain hazardous materials.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as applicable regulations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P74_S1	These programs may include collecting compliance data from our suppliers, full laboratory testing and public reporting of other environmental metrics such as carbon emissions, electronic waste and water, and we also require our supply chain to comply.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P74_S3	In the case of WEEE, the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P74_S4	However, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their obligations under WEEE.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	In addition, we are responsible for the cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	If more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed, or the results of future testing and analyses at our current or former operating facilities indicate that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the air, ground and/or water, we may be subject to additional liability.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Additional environmental matters may arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations or adequately address contaminated sites could limit our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to incur significant expenses, which would harm our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	If we do not effectively manage changes in our operations, our business may be harmed; we have taken substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may need to take material restructuring charges in the future.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	In recent years, we have experienced growth in our business through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P77_S1	However, our business also has been negatively impacted by the recent adverse global economic conditions.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P77_S2	The expansion of our business, as well as business contractions and other changes in our customers' requirements, have in the past, and may in the future, require that we adjust our business and cost structures by incurring restructuring charges.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Restructuring activities involve reductions in our workforce at some locations and closure of certain facilities.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P77_S4	All of these changes have in the past placed, and may in the future place, considerable strain on our financial and management control systems and resources, including decision support, accounting management, information systems and facilities.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P77_S5	If we do not properly manage our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures to manage our employees, our business could be harmed.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In recent years, including during fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we undertook initiatives to restructure our business operations through a series of restructuring activities, which were intended to realign our global capacity and infrastructure with demand by our OEM customers and thereby improve our operational efficiency.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	These activities included reducing excess workforce and capacity, transitioning manufacturing to lower-cost locations and eliminating redundant facilities, and consolidating and eliminating certain administrative facilities.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	While we incur severance, asset impairment charges and other charges as a result of changes in our customer mix on an ongoing basis, such individual actions were not considered material and did not qualify as restructuring charges per accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to be separately disclosed as restructuring charges in fiscal year 2015, and are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Our restructuring activities undertaken during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 have been disclosed separately on our statement of operations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P79_S2	We may be required to take additional charges in the future to align our operations and cost structures with global economic conditions, market demands, cost competitiveness, and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers' production requirements.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P79_S3	We may consolidate certain manufacturing facilities or transfer certain of our operations to lower cost geographies.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P79_S4	If we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P79_S5	Additionally, there are other potential risks associated with our restructurings that could adversely affect us, such as delays encountered with the finalization and implementation of the restructuring activities, work stoppages, and the failure to achieve targeted cost savings.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our operating costs.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We have manufacturing operations and industrial parks that are located in lower cost regions of the world, such as Asia, Eastern Europe and Mexico.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P81_S1	A portion of our purchases and our sale transactions are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P81_S2	As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in these currencies impacting our fixed cost overhead or our supply base relative to the currencies in which we conduct transactions.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors, including changes in a country's political and economic policies.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Volatility in the functional and non-functional currencies of our entities and the United States dollar could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The primary impact of currency exchange fluctuations is on the cash, receivables, payables and expenses of our operating entities.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	If our hedging activities are not successful or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected fluctuations in our operating results as a result of changes in exchange rates.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We are also exposed to risks related to the valuation of the Chinese currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The Chinese currency is the renminbi ("RMB").
866374_15_ITEM1A_P86_S1	A significant increase in the value of the RMB could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows by increasing both our manufacturing costs and the costs of our local supply base.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We depend on our executive officers and skilled management personnel.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Generally our employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P88_S2	We could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P88_S3	We will need to recruit and retain skilled management personnel, and if we are not able to do so, our business could be harmed.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P88_S4	In addition, in connection with expanding our design services offerings, we must attract and retain experienced design engineers.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P88_S5	There is substantial competition in our industry for highly skilled employees.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P88_S6	Our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our design services offerings, which could adversely affect our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in the payment of significant damages, which would reduce our net income.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, wages and overtime, discrimination, whistle-blowing, classification of employees and severance payments.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P90_S1	Enforcement activity relating to these laws, particularly outside of the United States, can increase as a result of increased media attention due to violations by other companies, changes in law, political and other factors.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P90_S2	There can be no assurance that we won't be found to have violated such laws in the future, due to a more aggressive enforcement posture by governmental authorities or for any other reason.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P90_S3	Any such violations could lead to the assessment of fines against us by federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees, which fines could be substantial and which would reduce our net income.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We may encounter difficulties with acquisitions, which could harm our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We have completed numerous acquisitions of businesses and we may acquire additional businesses in the future.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Any future acquisitions may require additional equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, or additional debt financing, which could increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P92_S3	As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P93_S1	The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P93_S2	The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P93_S3	In addition, the integration of acquired businesses may require that we incur significant restructuring charges.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including:
866374_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at acquired companies; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital; lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business; and exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	These and other factors have harmed, and in the future could harm, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our strategic relationships with major customers create risks.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P98_S0	In the past, we have completed numerous strategic transactions with OEM customers.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Under these arrangements, we generally acquire inventory, equipment and other assets from the OEM, and lease or acquire their manufacturing facilities, while simultaneously entering into multi-year manufacturing and supply agreements for the production of their products.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P98_S2	We may pursue these OEM divestiture transactions in the future.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P98_S3	These arrangements entered into with divesting OEMs typically involve many risks, including the following:
866374_15_ITEM1A_P99_S0	we may need to pay a purchase price to the divesting OEMs that exceeds the value we ultimately may realize from the future business of the OEM; the integration of the acquired assets and facilities into our business may be time-consuming and costly, including the incurrence of restructuring charges; we, rather than the divesting OEM, bear the risk of excess capacity at the facility; we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies at the facility; we may be unable to meet the expectations of the OEM as to volume, product quality, timeliness and cost reductions; our supply agreements with the OEMs generally do not require any minimum volumes of purchase by the OEMs, and the actual volume of purchases may be less than anticipated; and if demand for the OEMs' products declines, the OEM may reduce its volume of purchases, and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other OEMs.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P100_S0	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P100_S1	In addition, these strategic arrangements have not, and in the future may not, result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings per share.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P102_S0	We may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, may not align with our business strategies and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P103_S0	perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers and other third parties.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Changes in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P105_S0	We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P105_S1	These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P105_S2	For example, significant changes to revenue recognition rules have been enacted and will begin to apply to us as early as fiscal year 2018 unless the adoption date is postponed to our fiscal year 2019 as the FASB has proposed.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Changes to accounting rules or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Our business and operations could be adversely impacted by climate change initiatives.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Concern over climate change has led to international legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to seasonal demand.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Two of our significant end markets are the mobile devices market and the consumer devices market.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P109_S1	These markets exhibit particular strength generally in the two quarters leading up to the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P109_S2	As a result, we have historically experienced stronger revenues in our second and third fiscal quarters as compared to our other fiscal quarters.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P109_S3	Economic or other factors leading to diminished orders in the end of the calendar year could harm our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Our debt level may create limitations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P111_S0	As of March 31, 2015, our total debt was approximately $2.1 billion.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P111_S1	This level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Changes in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital or to borrow additional funds.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P112_S1	We may also be exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our outstanding borrowings and investments.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Our credit is rated by credit rating agencies.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P113_S1	Our 4.625% Notes and our 5.000% Notes are currently rated BB+ by Standard and Poor's ("S P") and Ba1 by Moody's, and are considered to be below "investment grade" debt by Moody's and S P.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P113_S2	Any further decline in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all; negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares; increase our interest payments under some of our existing debt agreements; and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P113_S3	In addition, the interest rate payable on some of our credit facilities is subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit ratings change.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P113_S4	Thus, any potential future negative change in our credit rating may increase the interest rate payable on these credit facilities.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P114_S0	In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk under our variable rate terms loans, bilateral facilities and revolving credit facility for indebtedness we have incurred or may incur under such borrowings.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P114_S1	The interest rates under these borrowings are based on either (i) a margin over LIBOR or (ii) the base rate (the greatest of the agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin, in each case depending on our credit rating.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P114_S2	Refer to the discussion in note 7, "Bank Borrowings and Long-Term Debt" to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our debt obligations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P114_S3	We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our invested cash balances, our securitization facilities and our factoring activities.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Weak global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and access to capital markets.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which our customers compete.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may create challenging conditions in the electronics industry.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P117_S1	These conditions may result in reduced consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries, a tightening in the credit markets, a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets and high volatility in credit, fixed income and equity markets.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P117_S2	In addition, longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P117_S3	If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other corporate purposes.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters; geopolitical conditions; terrorist activity; public health issues; cyber security incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation or telecommunications providers; or other catastrophic events.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P119_S1	Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P119_S2	While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P120_S0	We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P120_S1	We place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P120_S2	However, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P120_S3	The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P120_S4	The policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of self-insurance.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P120_S5	Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P121_S0	The market price of our ordinary shares is volatile.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P122_S0	The stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of companies, including technology companies.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P122_S1	These fluctuations have often been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P122_S2	The market for our ordinary shares has been and may in the future be subject to similar volatility.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P123_S0	innovations or events affecting other companies in the electronics industry, currency fluctuations, general market fluctuations, and macro-economic conditions may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P124_S0	The Company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P125_S1	The Company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships, developed technology and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P125_S2	The Company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P125_S3	The Company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Refer to notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements and 'critical accounting policies' in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P127_S0	A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the Company's businesses and the Company could be required to record impairment charges on its goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact the Company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the Company's consolidated statement of operations.
866374_15_ITEM1A_P127_S1	If the Company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the Company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing credit facilities, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.
866374_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facilities consist of a global network of industrial parks, regional manufacturing operations, and design, engineering and product introduction centers, providing approximately 24.4 million square feet of productive capacity as of March 31, 2015.
866374_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own facilities with approximately 7.7 million square feet in Asia, 3.5 million square feet in the Americas and 2.1 million square feet in Europe.
866374_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	We lease facilities with approximately 5.5 million square feet in Asia, 3.8 million square feet in the Americas and 1.8 million square feet in Europe.
866374_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our facilities include large industrial parks, ranging in size from under 100,000 to 3.2 million square feet in Brazil, China, Hungary, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and the Ukraine.
866374_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also have regional manufacturing operations, generally ranging in size from under 100,000 to approximately 2.7 million square feet in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the Ukraine and the United States.
866374_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also have smaller design and engineering centers and product introduction centers at a number of locations in the world's major consumer electronics and industrial markets.
866374_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our facilities are well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted.
866374_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	The productive capacity of our plants is adequate for current needs.
866374_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	For a description of our material legal proceedings, see note 12 "Commitments and Contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
866374_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low per share sales prices for our ordinary shares since the beginning of fiscal year 2014 as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
866374_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of May 14, 2015 there were 3,356 holders of record of our ordinary shares and the closing sales price of our ordinary shares as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was $12.52 per share.
866374_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	Since inception, we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares.
866374_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	We currently do not have plans to pay any dividends in fiscal year 2016.
866374_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following stock price performance graph and accompanying information is not deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.

866374_15_ITEM5_P8_S0	The following table provides information regarding purchases of our ordinary shares made by us for the period from January 1, 2015 through March 31, 2015.
866374_15_ITEM5_P9_S0	(1) During the period from January 1, 2015 through March 31, 2015 all purchases were made pursuant to the program discussed below in open market transactions.
866374_15_ITEM5_P9_S1	All purchases were made in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
866374_15_ITEM5_P9_S2	(2) On August 28, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our outstanding ordinary shares for up to $500 million.
866374_15_ITEM5_P9_S3	This is in accordance with the share repurchase mandate whereby our shareholders approved a repurchase limit of 20% of our issued ordinary shares outstanding at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on the same date as the Board authorization.
866374_15_ITEM5_P9_S4	As of March 31, 2015, shares in the aggregate amount of $238.4 million were available to be repurchased under the current Board authorization.
866374_15_ITEM5_P10_S0	Singapore does not impose a withholding tax on dividends.
866374_15_ITEM5_P10_S1	All dividends are tax exempt to shareholders.
866374_15_ITEM5_P11_S0	Under current Singapore tax law there is no tax on capital gains, thus any profits from the disposal of shares are not taxable in Singapore unless the gains arising from the disposal of shares are income in nature and subject to tax, especially if they arise from activities which the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore regards as the carrying on of a trade or business in Singapore (in which case, the profits on the sale would be taxable as trade profits rather than capital gains).
866374_15_ITEM5_P12_S0	Shareholders who apply, or who are required to apply, the Singapore Financial Reporting Standard 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement ("FRS 39") for the purposes of Singapore income tax may be required to recognize gains or losses (not being gains or losses in the nature of capital) in accordance with the provisions of FRS 39 (as modified by the applicable provisions of Singapore income tax law) even though no sale or disposal of shares is made.
866374_15_ITEM5_P13_S0	There is no stamp duty payable for holding shares, and no duty is payable on the acquisition of newly-issued shares.
866374_15_ITEM5_P14_S0	When existing shares are acquired in Singapore, a stamp duty is payable on the instrument of transfer of the shares at the rate of two Singapore dollars ("S$") for every S$1,000 of the market value of the shares.
866374_15_ITEM5_P15_S0	is an agreement to the contrary.
866374_15_ITEM5_P16_S0	If the instrument of transfer is executed outside of Singapore, the stamp duty must be paid only if the instrument of transfer is received in Singapore.
866374_15_ITEM5_P17_S0	The estate duty was abolished for deaths occurring on or after February 15, 2008.
866374_15_ITEM5_P17_S1	For deaths prior to February 15, 2008 the following rules apply:
866374_15_ITEM5_P18_S0	If an individual who is not domiciled in Singapore dies on or after January 1, 2002, no estate tax is payable in Singapore on any of our shares held by the individual.
866374_15_ITEM5_P19_S0	If property passing upon the death of an individual domiciled in Singapore includes our shares, Singapore estate duty is payable to the extent that the value of the shares aggregated with any other assets subject to Singapore estate duty exceeds S$600,000.
866374_15_ITEM5_P19_S1	Unless other exemptions apply to the other assets, for example, the separate exemption limit for residential properties, any excess beyond S$600,000 will be taxed at 5% on the first S$12,000,000 of the individual's chargeable assets and thereafter at 10%.
866374_15_ITEM5_P20_S0	An individual shareholder who is a U.S. citizen or resident (for U.S. estate tax purposes) will have the value of the shares included in the individual's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes.
866374_15_ITEM5_P20_S1	An individual shareholder generally will be entitled to a tax credit against the shareholder's U.S. estate tax to the extent the individual shareholder actually pays Singapore estate tax on the value of the shares; however, such tax credit is generally limited to the percentage of the U.S. estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the value of the shares included in the shareholder's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes, adjusted further by a pro rata apportionment of available exemptions.
866374_15_ITEM5_P20_S2	Individuals who are domiciled in Singapore should consult their own tax advisors regarding the Singapore estate tax consequences of their investment.
866374_15_ITEM5_P21_S0	There is no reciprocal income tax treaty between the U.S. and Singapore regarding withholding taxes on dividends and capital gains.
866374_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	These historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future.
866374_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) For fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
866374_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	The net other income in the fiscal year 2012, relates to the $20.0 million gain on sale of certain international entities.
866374_15_ITEM6_P3_S0	During fiscal year 2011, the Company recognized a $13.2 million loss associated with the early redemption of the 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes and an $11.7 million loss in connection with the divestiture of certain international entities.
866374_15_ITEM6_P3_S1	Additionally, the Company recognized a gain of $18.6 million associated with a sale of an equity investment that was previously fully impaired.
866374_15_ITEM6_P4_S0	(2) During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, the Company identified certain accounting errors in the statutory-to-U.S. GAAP adjustments at one of its foreign sites that originated in prior annual periods.
866374_15_ITEM6_P4_S1	Management conducted additional procedures and concluded that these errors were isolated to that location.
866374_15_ITEM6_P4_S2	These errors, which primarily understated cost of sales, totaled $10.4 million and $8.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively, and were corrected by the Company as an out-of-period adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.
866374_15_ITEM6_P4_S3	Management believes the impact of this item, to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and to prior fiscal years presented was not material.
866374_15_ITEM6_P4_S4	As a result of recording these adjustments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, net income for the year ended March 31, 2012 was reduced by $24.9 million ($0.03 per share).
866374_15_ITEM6_P5_S0	(3) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.
866374_15_ITEM6_P5_S1	(4) During fiscal year 2014, a previously wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company issued a non-controlling equity interest to certain third party investors in exchange for $38.6 million in cash for an ownership interest of less than 20% of the outstanding shares in the subsidiary.
866374_15_ITEM6_P5_S2	Accordingly, as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, the non-controlling interest has been included on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of total shareholders' equity.

866374_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a globally-recognized leading provider of innovative design, manufacturing, and supply chain services and solutions that span from sketch to scale ; from conceptual sketch to full-scale production.
866374_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	electronics business, including connected living, wearable electronics, game consoles, and connectivity devices; and our high-volume computing business, including various supply chain solutions for notebook personal computing, tablets and printers; Industrial and Emerging Industries ("IEI"), which is comprised of semiconductor and capital equipment, office solutions, test and measurement, household industrial and lifestyle, industrial automation and kiosks, energy and metering, and lighting; and Integrated Network Solutions ("INS"), which includes radio access base stations, remote radio heads, and small cells for wireless infrastructure; optical, routing, broadcasting and switching products for the data and video network; server and storage platforms for both enterprise and cloud based deployments; next generation storage and security appliance products and rack level solutions, converged infrastructure and software defined product solutions.
866374_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	As of March 31, 2015 the above described business groups comprise our reportable segments.
866374_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our strategy is to provide customers with a full range of cost competitive, vertically-integrated global supply chain solutions through which we can design, build, ship and service a complete packaged product for our OEM customers.
866374_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	This enables our OEM customers to leverage our supply chain solutions to meet their product requirements throughout the entire product life cycle.
866374_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Over the past few years, we have seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, primarily in the technology sector.
866374_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Some companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, Internet service providers or e-commerce retailers have entered the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology hardware markets, such as mobile devices, home entertainment and wearable devices.
866374_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	This trend has resulted in a significant change in the manufacturing and supply chain solutions requirements of such companies.
866374_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	While the products have become more complex, the supply chain solutions required by such companies have become more customized and demanding, and it has changed the manufacturing and supply chain landscape significantly.
866374_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	We use a portfolio approach to manage our extensive service offerings.
866374_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	As our OEM customers change the way they go to market, we are able to reorganize and rebalance our business portfolio in order to align with our customers' needs and requirements in an effort to optimize operating results.
866374_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	The objective of our business model is to allow us to be flexible and redeploy and reposition our assets and resources as necessary to meet specific customer's supply chain solutions needs across all of the markets we serve and earn a return on our invested capital above the weighted average cost of that capital.
866374_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	During the past few years we have made significant efforts to evolve our long-term portfolio towards a higher mix of businesses which possess longer product life cycles and higher margins such as reflected in our IEI and HRS businesses.
866374_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	During the last two fiscal years we launched several programs broadly across our portfolio of services and in some instances we deployed certain new technologies.
866374_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	Some of these programs have started to yield better results, as demonstrated by our margin improvement over a comparable base of sales during fiscal year 2015.
866374_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	We continue to invest in innovation and we have expanded our design and engineering relationships through our product innovation centers.
866374_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	We believe that our business transformation has strategically positioned us to take advantage of the long-term, future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities, design and engineering services and after-market services, which remain strong.
866374_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	We are one of the world's largest providers of global supply chain solutions, with revenues of $26.1 billion in fiscal year 2015.
866374_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	We have established an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world's major consumer electronics and industrial markets (Asia, the Americas, and Europe) in order to serve the growing outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	network of over 100 facilities in approximately 30 countries across four continents.
866374_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	As of March 31, 2015, our total manufacturing capacity was approximately 24.4 million square feet.
866374_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	In fiscal year 2015, our net sales in Asia, the Americas and Europe represented approximately 50%, 34% and 16%, respectively, of our total net sales, based on the location of the manufacturing site.
866374_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	The following tables set forth net sales and net property and equipment, by country, based on the location of our manufacturing sites and the relative percentages:
866374_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	We believe that the combination of our extensive open innovation platform solutions, design and engineering services, advanced supply chain management solutions and services, significant scale and global presence, and industrial campuses in low-cost geographic areas provide us with a competitive advantage and strong differentiation in the market for designing, manufacturing and servicing consumer electronics and industrial products for leading multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Specifically, we have launched multiple product innovation centers ("PIC") focused exclusively on offering our customers the ability to simplify their global product development, manufacturing process, and after sales services, and enable them to meaningfully accelerate their time to market and cost savings.
866374_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including the following:
866374_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	our customers' ability to cancel or delay orders or change production quantities; our customers' decisions to choose internal manufacturing instead of outsourcing for their product requirements; our exposure to financially troubled customers; integration of acquired businesses and facilities; increased labor costs due to adverse labor conditions in the markets we operate; and changes in tax legislation.
866374_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Net sales for fiscal year 2015 remained relatively stable from the prior year, increasing by 0.2% or $39.3 million to $26.1 billion.
866374_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Revenue increased for our IEI and HRS business groups, offset by decreases for our INS and CTG business groups.
866374_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Our fiscal year 2015 gross profit totaled $1.5 billion, representing an increase of $105.1 million, or 7.3%, and our income from continuing operations totaled $600.8 million, representing an increase of $235.2 million, or 64.3%, compared to fiscal year 2014.
866374_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	Both gross profit and income from continuing operations increased primarily as a result of an improved cost structure and operating efficiencies following our restructuring activities completed in the fiscal years 2014 and 2013 coupled with an increase in sales from our IEI and HRS business groups which contribute higher margins.
866374_15_ITEM7_P14_S4	Our income before taxes further benefited by the reversal of a customer contractual obligation in fiscal year 2015 in the amount of $55.0 million, which was accrued in fiscal year 2014, upon execution of an amendment to the customer contract in early fiscal year 2015, which relieved us of this contractual obligation, as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".
866374_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Cash provided by operations decreased approximately $422.4 million to $0.8 billion for the fiscal year 2015 compared with $1.2 billion for the fiscal year 2014 primarily due to unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities.
866374_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our average net working capital, defined as accounts receivable, including deferred purchase price receivable from our asset-backed securitization programs plus inventory less accounts payable, as a percentage of annualized sales increased by 0.3% to 7.8%.
866374_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	Our free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment, was $554.3 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $701.5 million for fiscal year 2014, primarily due to the lower cash flows from operations offset by lower net expenditures during fiscal year 2015.
866374_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for the free cash flows reconciliation to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of cash flows from operations.
866374_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $516.0 million during fiscal year 2015 and included repurchases of approximately 38.7 million ordinary shares at an aggregate purchase value of $415.9 million.
866374_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
866374_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
866374_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
866374_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	We recognize manufacturing revenue when we ship goods or the goods are received by our customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured.
866374_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Generally, there are no formal substantive customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services.
866374_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	If such requirements or obligations exist, then we recognize the related revenues at the time when such requirements are completed and the obligations are fulfilled.
866374_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Some of our customer contracts allow us to recover certain costs related to manufacturing services that are over and above the prices we charge for the related products.
866374_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	We determine the amount of costs that are recoverable based on historical experiences and agreements with those customers.
866374_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Also, certain customer contracts may contain certain commitments and obligations that may result in additional expenses or decrease in revenue.
866374_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	We accrue for these commitments and obligations based on facts and circumstances and contractual terms.
866374_15_ITEM7_P21_S4	We also make provisions for estimated sales returns and other adjustments at the time revenue is recognized based upon contractual terms and an analysis of historical returns.
866374_15_ITEM7_P21_S5	Provisions for sales returns and other adjustments were not material to our consolidated financial statements for any of the periods presented.
866374_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	We provide a comprehensive suite of services for our customers that range from advanced product design to manufacturing and logistics to after-sales services.
866374_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	We recognize service revenue when the services have been performed, and the related costs are expensed as incurred.
866374_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Our net sales for services were less than 10% of our total sales for all periods presented, and accordingly, are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	We have an established customer credit policy through which we manage customer credit exposures through credit evaluations, credit limit setting, monitoring, and enforcement of credit limits for new and existing customers.
866374_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and make provisions for doubtful accounts based on the outcome of those credit evaluations.
866374_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances, current economic trends, historical experience with collections and the age of past due receivables.
866374_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	To the extent we identify exposures as a result of credit or customer evaluations, we also review other customer related exposures, including but not limited to inventory and related contractual obligations.
866374_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We recognize restructuring charges related to our plans to close or consolidate excess manufacturing and administrative facilities and to realign our corporate cost structure.
866374_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	In connection with these activities, we recognize restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other exit-related costs.
866374_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	The recognition of these restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	To the extent our actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	We review property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
866374_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of these long-lived assets exceeds their fair value.
866374_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Recoverability of property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets are measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
866374_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets exceeds fair value.
866374_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Our judgments regarding projected cash flows for an extended period of time and the fair value of assets may be impacted by changes in market conditions, general business environment and other factors.
866374_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	To the extent our estimates relating to cash flows and fair value of assets change adversely we may have to recognize additional impairment charges in the future.
866374_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
866374_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors, market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis.
866374_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, the Company identified four reportable operating segments: HRS, CTG, IEI and INS and concluded these same four segments also represented its reporting units.
866374_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Company performed its goodwill impairment assessment on January 1, 2015 and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test because the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
866374_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value.
866374_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short-term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand.
866374_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	We purchase our inventory based on forecasted demand, and we estimate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand, and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers.
866374_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	If actual market conditions or our customers' product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional write downs may be required.
866374_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	In addition, unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers and/or changes in economic conditions may require additional write downs for inventories due to our customers' inability to fulfill their contractual obligations with regard to inventory procured to fulfill customer demand.
866374_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	We may be exposed to certain liabilities relating to our business operations, acquisitions of businesses and assets and other activities.
866374_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	We make provisions for such liabilities when it is probable that the settlement of the liability will result in an outflow of economic resources or the impairment of an asset.
866374_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	We make these assessments based on facts and circumstances that may change in the future resulting in additional expenses.
866374_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, which will result in deductible amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards.
866374_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize these deferred income tax assets.
866374_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors.
866374_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets previously recognized, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.
866374_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio, which consists of highly liquid investments or bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from original dates of purchase and are classified as cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions and highly rated money market accounts.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Our investment policy has strict guidelines focusing on preservation of capital.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The portfolio is comprised of various instruments including term deposits with banks, marketable securities and money market accounts.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our cash is principally invested in the U.S. dollar and China RMB serving as a natural hedge of our RMB denominated costs.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of March 31, 2015, the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was $0.7 billion, the largest components of which were USD and RMB denominated money market accounts with an average return of 2.45%.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We had variable rate debt outstanding of approximately $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2015.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Variable rate debt obligations consisted of borrowings under our term loans.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Interest on these obligations is discussed above.
866374_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our variable rate debt instruments create exposures for us related to interest rate risk.

866374_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	The Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from January 31 in order to better align with its reporting calendar.
866374_15_ITEM8_P47_S3	This change is within twelve months from the previous assessment date as well as within the same fiscal quarter and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

866374_15_ITEM8_P53_S3	Total intangible asset amortization expense recognized in continuing operations during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $32.0 million, $28.9 million and $29.5 million, respectively.
866374_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	The estimated future annual amortization expense for acquired intangible assets is as follows:
866374_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	All derivative instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
866374_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	If the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, effectiveness is tested monthly using a regression analysis of the change in the spot currency rates and the change in the present value of the spot currency rates.
866374_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	The spot currency rates are discounted to present value using functional currency LIBOR rates over the maximum length of the hedge period.
866374_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument (excluding time value) is recognized in shareholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the hedged item affects earnings.
866374_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	Ineffective and excluded portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings immediately.
866374_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	If the derivative instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period.
866374_15_ITEM8_P57_S3	Additional information is included in note 8.
866374_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	Other current assets includes approximately $600.7 million and $470.9 million as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively for the deferred purchase price receivable from the Company's Global and North American Asset-Backed Securitization programs.
866374_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	See note 10 for additional information.
866374_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	Other current assets as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 included certain assets purchased on behalf of a customer and financed by a third party banking institution of $169.2 million and $267.5 million, respectively, as further described in note 17.
866374_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company has certain equity investments in, and notes receivable from, non-publicly traded companies which are included within other assets.
866374_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	The equity method of accounting is used when the Company has the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer; otherwise the cost method is used.
866374_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company monitors these investments for impairment indicators and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values as required.
866374_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	Fair values of these investments, when required, are estimated using unobservable inputs, primarily discounted cash flow projections.
866374_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	As of March 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's equity investments in non-majority owned companies totaled $87.0 million and $77.4 million, respectively.
866374_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	The equity in the earnings or losses of the Company's equity method investments was not material to the consolidated results of operations for any period presented and is included in interest and other, net.
866374_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	Other current liabilities include customer working capital advances of $189.6 million and $754.7 million, customer-related accruals of $454.8 million and $327.5 million, and deferred revenue of $272.6 million and $296.3 million as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
866374_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	The customer working capital advances are not interest bearing, do not have fixed repayment dates and are generally reduced as the underlying working capital is consumed in production.
866374_15_ITEM8_P63_S2	Other current liabilities as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 also included the outstanding balances due to the third party banking institution related to the financed equipment discussed above, that amounted to $197.7 million and $286.5 million, respectively, as further described in note 17.
866374_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Company recognizes restructuring charges related to its plans to close or consolidate excess manufacturing and administrative facilities.
866374_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	In connection with these activities, the Company records restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other exit-related costs.
866374_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	The recognition of restructuring charges requires the Company to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	To the extent the Company's actual results differ from its estimates and assumptions, the Company may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_15_ITEM8_P65_S2	Such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_15_ITEM8_P65_S3	At the end of each reporting period, the Company evaluates the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_15_ITEM8_P65_S4	See note 14 for additional information regarding restructuring charges.
866374_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements.
866374_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	Under the new guidance, an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset.
866374_15_ITEM8_P66_S2	Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense.
866374_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and early adoption is permitted in an interim period with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
866374_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	The guidance is not expected to have a significant impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
866374_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance which requires an entity to recognize revenue relating to contracts with customers that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
866374_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	In order to meet this requirement, the entity must apply the following steps: (i) identify the contracts with the customers; (ii) identify performance obligations in the contracts; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations per the contracts; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
866374_15_ITEM8_P68_S2	Additionally, disclosures required for revenue recognition will include qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
866374_15_ITEM8_P68_S3	In April 2015, the FASB proposed to defer the effective date of the standard by a year and if such proposal is adopted, this guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
866374_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements.
866374_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance which requires an entity to report a disposal of a component of an entity in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when the component of an entity meets certain criteria to be classified as held for sale, or when the component of an entity is otherwise disposed.
866374_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	The Company early adopted this accounting standard update in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015.
866374_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	During fiscal year 2015, the Company recognized a loss of $11.0 million recorded in other income and expense, for the disposal of a manufacturing facility in Western Europe which did not meet the criteria of discontinued operations under this accounting standard.
866374_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	During fiscal year 2015, the Company granted equity compensation awards under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan") and the 2013 Elementum Plan (the "Elementum Plan").
866374_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	The 2010 Plan is administered by Flextronics International Ltd., while the Elementum Plan is administered by Elementum SCM (Cayman) Limited ("Elementum"), a majority owned subsidiary of the Company.
866374_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	The 2010 Equity Incentive Plan of Flextronics International Ltd.
866374_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	As of March 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 34.6 million shares available for grant under the 2010 Plan.
866374_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	Options issued to employees under the 2010 Plan generally vest over four years and expire seven years from the date of grant.
866374_15_ITEM8_P73_S2	Options granted to non-employee directors expire five years from the date of grant.
866374_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	The exercise price of options granted to employees is determined by the Company's Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and may not be less than the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant.
866374_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company also grants share bonus awards under its equity compensation plan.
866374_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	Share bonus awards are rights to acquire a specified number of ordinary shares for no cash consideration in exchange for continued service with the Company.
866374_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Vesting for certain share bonus awards is contingent upon both service and market conditions.
866374_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense:
866374_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	As required by the authoritative guidance for stock-based compensation, management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.
866374_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary termination behavior as well as an analysis of actual forfeitures.
866374_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	As of March 31, 2015, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share options granted to employees under the Company's 2010 Plan was approximately $0.1 million, net of estimated forfeitures.
866374_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years and will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_15_ITEM8_P80_S2	As of March 31, 2015, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share bonus awards granted to employees was approximately $90.2 million, net of estimated forfeitures.
866374_15_ITEM8_P80_S3	This cost will be amortized generally on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years and will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_15_ITEM8_P80_S4	Approximately $15.4 million of the unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, is related to share bonus awards granted to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting a certain market condition.
866374_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	Cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits (tax benefits related to the excess of proceeds from employee exercises of share options over the share-based compensation cost recognized for those options) are classified as financing cash flows.
866374_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	During fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not recognize any excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow.
866374_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share options granted under the 2010 Plan using the Black-Scholes valuation method and a single option award approach.
866374_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
866374_15_ITEM8_P82_S2	The fair market value of share bonus awards granted, other than those awards with a market condition, is the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant and is generally recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.
866374_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	Expected Term The Company's expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation method represents the period that the Company's share options are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share options, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its share options.
866374_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	Expected Volatility The Company's expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes valuation method is derived from a combination of implied volatility related to publicly traded options to purchase Flextronics ordinary shares and historical variability in the Company's periodic share price.
866374_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	Expected Dividend The Company has never paid dividends on its ordinary shares and accordingly the dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.
866374_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities issued with a term equivalent to the expected term of the option.
866374_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	There were no options granted under the 2010 Plan during fiscal year 2014.
866374_15_ITEM8_P87_S1	The fair value of the Company's share options granted to employees for fiscal years 2015 and 2013 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	Options granted during the 2015 and 2013 fiscal years had contractual lives of seven years.
866374_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share bonus awards granted under the 2010 Plan whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions using Monte Carlo simulation.
866374_15_ITEM8_P89_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is the service period.
866374_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	Expected volatility of Flextronics Volatility used in Monte Carlo simulation is derived from the historical volatility of Flextronics' stock price over a period equal to the service period of the share bonus awards granted.
866374_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	The service period is three years for those share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013.
866374_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	the share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, and historical volatilities of the S P 500 index for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal year 2013 based on the various service periods.
866374_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	Average Peer Correlation Correlation coefficients were used to model the movement of Flextronics' stock price relative to both the S P 500 index and peers in the extended EMS group for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, and relative to the S P 500 index for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal year 2013.
866374_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	Expected Dividend The Company has never paid dividends on its ordinary shares and accordingly the dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.
866374_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Monte Carlo simulation on the yield of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bills, as of the measurement date.
866374_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	The fair value of the Company's share-bonus awards, whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions, for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	The following is a summary of option activity for the Company's 2010 Plan ("Price" reflects the weighted-average exercise price):
866374_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised (calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying award and the price of the Company's ordinary shares determined as of the time of option exercise for options exercised in-the-money) under the Company's 2010 Plan was $16.3 million, $24.7 million and $13.0 million during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively.
866374_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	Cash received from option exercises was $23.5 million, $28.1 million and $22.3 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
866374_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	The following table presents the composition of options outstanding and exercisable as of March 31, 2015:
866374_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	As of March 31, 2015, the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding, options vested and expected to vest (which includes adjustments for expected forfeitures), and options exercisable were $78.1 million, $78.1 million and $77.9 million, respectively.
866374_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company's ordinary shares as of March 31, 2015 for the approximately 15.7 million options that were in-the-money at March 31, 2015.
866374_15_ITEM8_P100_S2	As of March 31, 2015, the weighted average remaining contractual life for options exercisable was 0.65 years.
866374_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's share bonus award activity ("Price" reflects the weighted-average grant-date fair value):
866374_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	Of the 19.0 million unvested share bonus awards outstanding as of the fiscal year ended 2015, approximately 4.9 million represents the target amount of grants made to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions summarized as follows:
866374_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance, the Company will continue to recognize share-based compensation expense for these awards with market conditions regardless of whether such awards will ultimately vest.
866374_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	During fiscal year 2015, 0.3 million shares vested in connection with the remaining number of share bonus awards with market conditions granted in fiscal year 2011, and 0.4 million shares vested in connection with half of the share bonus awards with market conditions granted in fiscal year 2012.
866374_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	The total intrinsic value of share bonus awards vested under the Company's 2010 Plan was $79.0 million, $42.4 million and $9.7 million during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, based on the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date vested.
866374_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	The 2013 Equity Incentive Plan of Elementum SCM (Cayman) Ltd.
866374_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	As of March 31, 2015 Elementum had approximately 5.0 million shares available for future grants under the 2013 Elementum Plan.
866374_15_ITEM8_P106_S1	Options issued to employees under this Plan vest over a period of four years and expire ten years from the grant date.
866374_15_ITEM8_P106_S2	As of March 31, 2015 there were 16.0 million of options outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $0.27 per option.
866374_15_ITEM8_P106_S3	Total unrecognized compensation expenses relating to stock options granted to certain employees under the Elementum Plan as of March 31, 2015 is $2.1 million, and will be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.29 years.
866374_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	Basic earnings per share for both continuing and discontinued operations exclude dilution and are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the applicable periods.
866374_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	Diluted earnings per share for both continuing and discontinued operations reflect the potential dilution from stock options and share bonus awards.
866374_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	The potential dilution from stock options exercisable into ordinary share equivalents and share bonus awards was computed using the treasury stock method based on the average fair market value of the Company's ordinary shares for the period.
866374_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	The following table reflects the basic weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding and diluted weighted-average ordinary share equivalents used to calculate basic and diluted income from continuing and discontinued operations per share:
866374_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	(1) Options to purchase ordinary shares of 6.2 million, 17.1 million and 20.6 million during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and share bonus awards of less than 0.1 million and 0.3 million during fiscal years 2015 and 2013, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive impact on the weighted average ordinary shares equivalents.
866374_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	There were no anti-dilutive share bonus awards in fiscal year 2014.
866374_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	During fiscal year 2014, a previously wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company received $38.6 million in exchange for issuing a non-controlling equity interest to certain third party investors for an ownership interest of less than 20% of the outstanding shares in the subsidiary.
866374_15_ITEM8_P112_S1	The Company continues to own a majority of the subsidiary's outstanding equity and also controls the subsidiary's board of directors.
866374_15_ITEM8_P112_S2	Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements include the financial position and results of operations of this subsidiary as of March 31, 2015 and for the year then ended.
866374_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	The Company has recognized the carrying value of the non-controlling interest as a component of total shareholders' equity.
866374_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	The operating results of the subsidiary attributable to the non-controlling interests are immaterial for all of the periods presented and are included in interest and other, net.
866374_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	The following table represents supplemental cash flow disclosures and non-cash investing and financing activities:

866374_15_ITEM8_P129_S2	These unsecured credit facilities, and lines of credit and other loans bear annual interest at the respective country's inter-bank offering rate, plus an applicable margin, and generally have maturities that expire on various dates in future fiscal years.
866374_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	The Company transacts business in various foreign countries and is therefore, exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in forecasted sales, cost of sales, and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_15_ITEM8_P130_S1	The Company has established risk management programs to protect against volatility in the value of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, and of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
866374_15_ITEM8_P130_S2	The Company tries to maintain a partial or fully hedged position for certain transaction exposures, which are primarily, but not limited to, revenues, customer and vendor payments and inter-company balances in currencies other than the functional currency unit of the operating entity.
866374_15_ITEM8_P130_S3	The Company enters into short-term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities, primarily accounts receivable and accounts payable, and cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_15_ITEM8_P130_S4	Gains and losses on the Company's forward and swap contracts are designed to offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and transactions hedged, and accordingly, generally do not subject the Company to risk of significant accounting losses.
866374_15_ITEM8_P130_S5	The Company hedges committed exposures and does not engage in speculative transactions.
866374_15_ITEM8_P130_S6	The credit risk of these forward and swap contracts is minimized since the contracts are with large financial institutions and accordingly, fair value adjustments related to the credit risk of the counterparty financial institution were not material.
866374_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	As of March 31, 2015, the aggregate notional amount of the Company's outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts was $3.6 billion as summarized below:
866374_15_ITEM8_P132_S0	As of March 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the Company's short-term foreign currency contracts was not material and included in other current assets or other current liabilities, as applicable, in the consolidated balance sheets.
866374_15_ITEM8_P132_S1	Certain of these contracts are designed to economically hedge the Company's exposure to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and are not accounted for as hedges under the accounting standards.
866374_15_ITEM8_P132_S2	Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change as a component of interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_15_ITEM8_P132_S3	As of March 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company also has included net deferred losses, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets, relating to changes in fair value of its foreign currency contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
866374_15_ITEM8_P132_S4	These deferred losses totaled $17.3 million as of March 31, 2015, and are expected to be recognized primarily as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations over the next twelve month period.
866374_15_ITEM8_P132_S5	The gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness were not material for all fiscal years presented and are included as a component of interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	The following table presents the fair value of the Company's derivative instruments utilized for foreign currency risk management purposes at March 31, 2015 and 2014:
866374_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	The Company has financial instruments subject to master netting arrangements, which provides for the net settlement of all contracts with a single counterparty.
866374_15_ITEM8_P134_S1	The Company does not offset fair value amounts for assets and liabilities recognized for derivative instruments under these arrangements, and as such, the asset and liability balances presented in the table above reflect the gross amounts of derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets.
866374_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	The impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities is not material to the Company's financial position for any of the periods presented.
866374_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	The changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component, net of tax, during fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:
866374_15_ITEM8_P137_S0	Net losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss during the fiscal year 2015 relating to derivative instruments and other includes $36.2 million attributable to the Company's cash flow hedge instruments which were recognized as a component of cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.
866374_15_ITEM8_P138_S0	During fiscal year 2015, the Company recognized a loss of $11.0 million in connection with the disposition of a manufacturing facility in Western Europe.
866374_15_ITEM8_P138_S1	This loss includes the settlement of unrealized losses of $4.2 million on an insignificant defined benefit plan associated with the disposed facility offset by the release of cumulative foreign currency translation gains of $9.3 million, both of which have been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss during the period.
866374_15_ITEM8_P138_S2	The loss on sale is included in other charges (income), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.
866374_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	The Company sells trade receivables under two asset-backed securitization programs and an accounts receivable factoring program.
866374_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	The Company continuously sells designated pools of trade receivables under its Global Asset-Backed Securitization Agreement (the "Global Program") and its North American Asset-Backed Securitization Agreement (the "North American Program," collectively, the "ABS Programs") to affiliated special purpose entities, each of which in turn sells 100% of the receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions.
866374_15_ITEM8_P140_S1	These programs allow the operating subsidiaries to receive a cash payment and a deferred purchase price receivable for sold receivables.
866374_15_ITEM8_P140_S2	Following the transfer of the receivables to the special purpose entities, the transferred receivables are isolated from the Company and its affiliates, and upon the sale of the receivables from the special purpose entities to the unaffiliated financial institutions effective control of the transferred receivables is passed to the unaffiliated financial institutions, which has the right to pledge or sell the receivables.
866374_15_ITEM8_P140_S3	Although the special purpose entities are consolidated by the Company, they are separate corporate entities and their assets are available first to satisfy the claims of their creditors.
866374_15_ITEM8_P140_S4	The investment limits set by the financial institutions are $550.0 million for the Global Program and $225.0 million for the North American Program.
866374_15_ITEM8_P140_S5	Both programs require a minimum level of deferred purchase price receivable to be retained by the Company in connection with the sales.
866374_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the special purpose entities and receives a servicing fee of 0.1% to 0.5% of serviced receivables per annum.
866374_15_ITEM8_P141_S1	Servicing fees recognized during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were not material and are included in interest and other, net within the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_15_ITEM8_P141_S2	As the Company estimates the fee it receives in return for its obligation to service these receivables is at fair value, no servicing assets or liabilities are recognized.
866374_15_ITEM8_P142_S0	As of March 31, 2015 and 2014, the accounts receivable balances that were sold under the ABS Programs were removed from the consolidated balance sheets and the net cash proceeds received by the Company during fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were included as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
866374_15_ITEM8_P143_S0	As of March 31, 2015, approximately $1.3 billion of accounts receivable had been sold to the special purpose entities under the ABS Programs for which the Company had received net cash proceeds of $740.7 million and deferred purchase price receivables of $600.7 million.
866374_15_ITEM8_P143_S1	As of March 31, 2014, approximately $1.2 billion of accounts receivable had been sold to the special purpose entities for which the Company had received net cash proceeds of $729.3 million and deferred purchase price receivables of $470.9 million.
866374_15_ITEM8_P143_S2	The portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid by the unaffiliated financial institutions in cash is a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid to the special purpose entity as payments on the receivables are collected from account debtors.
866374_15_ITEM8_P143_S3	The deferred purchase price receivable represents a beneficial interest in the transferred financial assets and is recognized at fair value as part of the sale transaction.
866374_15_ITEM8_P143_S4	The deferred purchase price receivables are included in other current assets as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and were carried at the expected recovery amount of the related receivables.
866374_15_ITEM8_P143_S5	The difference between the carrying amount of the receivables sold under these programs and the sum of the cash and fair value of the deferred purchase price receivables received at time of transfer is recognized as a loss on sale of the related receivables and recorded in interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations; such amounts were $7.1 million for both fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, and $7.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013.
866374_15_ITEM8_P144_S0	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, cash flows from sales of receivables under the ABS Programs consisted of approximately $4.3 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively for transfers of receivables (of which approximately $0.3 billion, $0.4 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively represented new transfers and the remainder proceeds from collections reinvested in revolving period transfers).
866374_15_ITEM8_P145_S0	The following table summarizes the activity in the deferred purchase price receivables account during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014:
866374_15_ITEM8_P146_S0	The Company also sold accounts receivables to certain third-party banking institutions.

866374_15_ITEM8_P146_S2	For the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, total accounts receivables sold to certain third party banking institutions was approximately $4.2 billion, $3.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
866374_15_ITEM8_P146_S3	The receivables that were sold were removed from the consolidated balance sheets and were reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
866374_15_ITEM8_P147_S0	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
866374_15_ITEM8_P147_S1	When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact, and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
866374_15_ITEM8_P148_S0	The accounting guidance for fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.
866374_15_ITEM8_P148_S1	A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
866374_15_ITEM8_P148_S2	The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
866374_15_ITEM8_P149_S0	Level 1 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
866374_15_ITEM8_P150_S0	The Company has deferred compensation plans for its officers and certain other employees.
866374_15_ITEM8_P150_S1	Amounts deferred under the plans are invested in hypothetical investments selected by the participant or the participant's investment manager.
866374_15_ITEM8_P150_S2	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets are included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets and include investments in equity securities that are valued using active market prices.
866374_15_ITEM8_P151_S0	Level 2 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets) such as cash and cash equivalents and money market funds; or model- derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
866374_15_ITEM8_P152_S0	The Company values foreign exchange forward contracts using level 2 observable inputs which primarily consist of an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
866374_15_ITEM8_P153_S0	The Company's cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits and money market funds, which are valued using level 2 inputs, such as interest rates and maturity periods.
866374_15_ITEM8_P153_S1	Due to their short-term nature, their carrying amount approximates fair value.
866374_15_ITEM8_P154_S0	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets also include money market funds, mutual funds, corporate and government bonds and certain convertible securities that are valued using prices obtained from various pricing sources.
866374_15_ITEM8_P155_S0	market indices and the performance of these investments in relation to these indices.
866374_15_ITEM8_P155_S1	As a result, the Company has classified these investments as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
866374_15_ITEM8_P156_S0	Level 3 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
866374_15_ITEM8_P157_S0	The Company accrues for contingent consideration in connection with its business acquisitions as applicable, which is measured at fair value based on certain internal models and inputs.
866374_15_ITEM8_P157_S1	During fiscal year 2015, the Company paid $11.3 million of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Saturn Electronics and Engineering Inc.
866374_15_ITEM8_P157_S2	The following table summarizes the activities related to contingent consideration:
866374_15_ITEM8_P158_S0	The Company values deferred purchase price receivables relating to its Asset-Backed Securitization Program based on a discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable inputs (i.e. level 3 inputs), which are primarily risk free interest rates adjusted for the credit quality of the underlying creditor.
866374_15_ITEM8_P158_S1	Due to its high credit quality and short term maturity, their fair value approximates carrying value.
866374_15_ITEM8_P158_S2	Significant increases in either of the significant unobservable inputs (credit spread or risk free interest rate) in isolation would result in lower fair value estimates, however the impact is insignificant.
866374_15_ITEM8_P158_S3	The interrelationship between these inputs is also insignificant.
866374_15_ITEM8_P158_S4	Refer to note 10 for a reconciliation of the change in the deferred purchase price receivable.
866374_15_ITEM8_P159_S0	There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy during fiscal years 2015 and 2014.
866374_15_ITEM8_P160_S0	The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2015 and 2014:
866374_15_ITEM8_P161_S0	The Company has certain long-lived assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, and are as follows:
866374_15_ITEM8_P162_S0	Assets held for sale are recorded at the lesser of the carrying value or fair value, which is based on comparable sales from prevailing market data (level 2 inputs).
866374_15_ITEM8_P162_S1	These assets primarily represent manufacturing facilities that have been closed as part of the Company's historical facility consolidations and that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
866374_15_ITEM8_P162_S2	During fiscal year 2014, the Company transferred $59.4 million assets to assets held for sale, and expected to sell these within a period of twelve months.
866374_15_ITEM8_P162_S3	Disposals of assets held for sale totaled $41.5 million and $24.5 million during fiscal year 2015 and 2014, respectively, which resulted in a gain of $12.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively, and was included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations.
866374_15_ITEM8_P162_S4	No impairment charges were recorded for assets held for sale during fiscal year 2015.
866374_15_ITEM8_P162_S5	Impairment charges during fiscal year 2014 were not significant for assets that were no longer in use and held for sale.
866374_15_ITEM8_P162_S6	Assets held for sale as of the 2015 fiscal year end were not significant.
866374_15_ITEM8_P163_S0	There were no material fair value adjustments or other transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy for these long-lived assets during the fiscal years 2015 and 2014.
866374_15_ITEM8_P164_S0	The following table presents the Company's liabilities not carried at fair value as at March 31, 2015 and 2014:
866374_15_ITEM8_P165_S0	All of the above debts are valued based on broker trading prices in active markets.
866374_15_ITEM8_P166_S0	As of March 31, 2015 and 2014, the gross carrying amount and associated accumulated depreciation of the Company's property and equipment financed under capital leases, and the related obligations was not material.
866374_15_ITEM8_P167_S0	These operating leases expire in various years through 2028 and require the following minimum lease payments:
866374_15_ITEM8_P168_S0	Total rent expense amounted to $133.1 million, $150.1 million and $138.8 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
866374_15_ITEM8_P169_S0	On December 11, 2013, Xilinx, Inc. (plaintiff) filed a lawsuit in Santa Clara County, California, Superior Court against Flextronics International Ltd.; Flextronics International USA, Inc.; and Flextronics Corporation (Case No. 113CV257431).
866374_15_ITEM8_P169_S1	The complaint asserts various claims, including fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and unfair competition, based on specific alleged incidents concerning our purchases and sales of Xilinx products.
866374_15_ITEM8_P169_S2	The plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory, statutory, punitive, and other forms of damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees and costs.
866374_15_ITEM8_P169_S3	The plaintiff also seeks a jury trial.
866374_15_ITEM8_P170_S0	On June 25, 2014, the Company filed motions for demurrer and to strike asking the court to dismiss the claims against itself.
866374_15_ITEM8_P170_S1	The court held a hearing on March 18, 2015 on the Company's motion for demurrer and to strike Xilinx's complaint.
866374_15_ITEM8_P170_S2	On March 26, 2015, the court granted the Company's motion, rejecting most of Xilinx's complaint, but allowing Xilinx the opportunity to file an amended complaint by April 25, 2015.
866374_15_ITEM8_P170_S3	Xilinx filed its amended complaint on April 27, 2015, and the Company's response is due May 29, 2015.
866374_15_ITEM8_P170_S4	Although the outcome of this matter is currently not determinable, management expects that any losses that are probable or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of this matter, which are in excess of amounts already accrued in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, would not be material to the financial statements.
866374_15_ITEM8_P171_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received an assessment for certain sales and import taxes.
866374_15_ITEM8_P171_S1	The tax assessment notice is for nine months of calendar year 2010.
866374_15_ITEM8_P171_S2	This assessment is in the second stage of the review process at the administrative level, and we plan to continue to vigorously oppose it as well as any future assessments.
866374_15_ITEM8_P171_S3	We are, however, unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of these assessments against our Brazilian subsidiary.
866374_15_ITEM8_P171_S4	While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liabilities, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the administrative-review and judicial processes in Brazil and the nature of the claims, we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any.

866374_15_ITEM8_P178_S1	In general, these holidays were secured based on the nature, size and location of the Company's operations.
866374_15_ITEM8_P178_S2	The aggregate dollar effect on the Company's income resulting from tax holidays and tax incentives to attract and retain business for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $9.8 million, $15.2 million and $22.6 million, respectively.

866374_15_ITEM8_P181_S0	Utilization of the Company's deferred tax assets is limited by the future earnings of the Company in the tax jurisdictions in which such deferred assets arose.
866374_15_ITEM8_P181_S1	As a result, management is uncertain as to when or whether these operations will generate sufficient profit to realize any benefit from the deferred tax assets.
866374_15_ITEM8_P182_S0	The valuation allowance provides a reserve against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized by the Company.
866374_15_ITEM8_P182_S1	However, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize certain of these benefits and, accordingly, has recognized a deferred tax asset from these benefits.
866374_15_ITEM8_P182_S2	The change in valuation allowance is net of certain increases and decreases to prior year losses and other carryforwards that have no current impact on the tax provision.
866374_15_ITEM8_P182_S3	Approximately $34.0 million of the valuation allowance relates to income tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options, which if realized will be credited directly to shareholders' equity and will not be available to benefit the income tax provision in any future period.

866374_15_ITEM8_P188_S0	The Company's unrecognized tax benefits are subject to change over the next twelve months primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and as audits are settled.
866374_15_ITEM8_P188_S1	The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by an estimated range of $25 million to $52 million within the next twelve months primarily due to potential settlements of various audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.
866374_15_ITEM8_P189_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file federal, state, and local income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions around the world.
866374_15_ITEM8_P189_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005.
866374_15_ITEM8_P190_S0	Of the $222.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2015, $186.8 million will affect the annual effective tax rate if the benefits are eventually recognized.
866374_15_ITEM8_P190_S1	The amount that does not impact the effective tax rate relates to positions that would be settled with a tax loss carryforward previously subject to a valuation allowance.
866374_15_ITEM8_P191_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within the Company's tax expense.

866374_15_ITEM8_P260_S0	(1) Earnings per share are computed independently for each quarter presented; therefore, the sum of the quarterly earnings per share may not equal the total earnings per share amounts for the fiscal year.

866374_15_ITEM8_P261_S1	The Company classified approximately $35.1 million and $23.5 million of these charges as a component of cost of sales during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2014, respectively, and approximately $5.6 million and $11.1 million of these charges as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2014, respectively.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2015.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2015, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	As of March 31, 2015, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation was conducted of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").
866374_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2015.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements or prevent or detect instances of fraud.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management's annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015 excluded the internal control over financial reporting of all four of our acquisitions that were completed during the year ended March 31, 2015, which constitute, in the aggregate, less than 1% of both total assets and net sales of the consolidated financial statements amount as of, and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended March 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Flextronics International Ltd.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Flextronics International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	As described in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of all four acquisitions that were completed during the year ended March 31, 2015, which constitute, in aggregate, less than 1% of both total assets and net sales of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting of all four acquisitions.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P6_S3	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P6_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
866374_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P7_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P10_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
866374_15_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated May 20, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

866374_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	OVERVIEW We are a globally-recognized, leading provider of innovative design, engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain services and solutions that span from sketch to scale tm ; from conceptual sketch to full-scale production.
866374_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	We design, build, ship and service complete packaged consumer and industrial products for original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), through our activities in the following segments:
866374_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Communications Enterprise Compute (" CEC "), formerly referred to as Integrated Network Solutions ( INS ), which includes radio access base stations, remote radio heads, and small cells for wireless infrastructure; optical, routing, broadcasting, and switching products for the data and video networks; server and storage platforms for both enterprise and cloud based deployments; next generation storage and security appliance products; and rack level solutions, converged infrastructure and software defined product solutions.
866374_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	We provide our advanced design, manufacturing and supply chain services through a network of over 100 facilities in approximately 30 countries across four continents.
866374_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	We have established this extensive network of design and manufacturing facilities in the world's major consumer electronics and industrial products markets (Asia, the Americas, and Europe) in order to serve the outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our services increase our customers' competitiveness by delivering improved product quality, increased flexibility, leading manufacturability, improved performance, faster time-to-market, and competitive costs.
866374_16_ITEM1_P2_S3	Our OEM customers leverage our services to meet their requirements throughout their products' entire life cycles.
866374_16_ITEM1_P2_S4	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 , we had revenue of $24.4 billion and net income of $444.1 million .
866374_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	We believe that the combination of our extensive open innovation platform solutions, design and engineering services, advanced supply chain management solutions and services, significant scale and global presence, and industrial campuses in low-cost geographies provide us with a competitive advantage and strong differentiation in the market for designing, manufacturing, and servicing consumer electronics and industrial products for leading multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	Through these services and facilities, we offer our OEM customers accelerated design, increased flexibility and responsiveness, improved time to market, and supply chain predictability and real time visibility, which enable them to accelerate product launches, enter new markets, mitigate risks, and improve free cash flow.
866374_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our business has been subject to seasonality, primarily due to our mobile devices and consumer electronics markets exposure, which are part of our CTG segment, which historically exhibit particular strength generally in the last two quarters of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	We recognized research and development costs primarily related to our design and innovations businesses of $75.5 million , $35.2 million , and $30.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
866374_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Our expertise is in the design, manufacture, and supply services for a broad range of products; as such, the closest definition of our industry is the outsourced Electronics Manufacturing Services ("EMS") industry.
866374_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	EMS has experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elect to outsource some or all of their design, manufacturing, and after-market services requirements.
866374_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	In recent years, we have seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, primarily in the technology sector.
866374_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	Companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, internet service providers, or e-commerce retailers are entering the highly competitive and rapidly evolving hardware markets, with products including mobile devices, home entertainment and wearable devices.
866374_16_ITEM1_P6_S4	This trend has resulted in significant changes to the hardware manufacturing and supply chain solutions requirements of such companies.
866374_16_ITEM1_P6_S5	Increasingly complex products require highly customized supply chain solutions, in turn resulting in significant changes to the overall manufacturing and supply chain landscape.
866374_16_ITEM1_P6_S6	The growth of the overall industry for calendar year 2015 is estimated to have been around 6% .
866374_16_ITEM1_P6_S7	We believe the total available market for the EMS industry is poised for continued growth, with current penetration rates estimated to be less than 30% .
866374_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	The intensely competitive nature of the electronics industry, the increasing complexity and sophistication of electronics products, and pressure on OEMs to reduce product costs and shorten product life cycles are all factors that encourage OEMs to utilize supply chain service providers as part of their business and manufacturing strategies.
866374_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	Utilizing global manufacturing and service providers allows OEMs to take advantage of the global design, manufacturing and supply chain management expertise of such providers, and enables OEMs to concentrate on product research, development, marketing, and sales.
866374_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	We believe that OEMs realize a number of important benefits through their strategic relationships with EMS providers, including:
866374_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Ability to focus on core branding and R D initiatives.
866374_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	We believe that growth in the EMS industry will be largely driven by the need for OEMs to respond to rapidly changing markets and technologies, the increasing complexity of supply chains and the continued pressure to be cost competitive.
866374_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Additionally, we believe that there are significant opportunities for global EMS providers to win additional business from OEMs in markets or industry segments that have yet to substantially utilize such providers.
866374_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	SERVICE OFFERINGS We offer a broad range of customizable services to OEMs.
866374_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	We believe that Flex has the broadest worldwide end-to-end supply chain solution capabilities in the industry, from concept design resources to aftermarket services.
866374_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	competitive advantage is the Flex Platform, which is our system for improving customer competitiveness by providing superior speed, scope, and scale:

866374_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	This approach increases the competitiveness of our customers by reducing logistical barriers and costs, improving communications, increasing flexibility, lowering transportation costs and reducing turnaround times.
866374_16_ITEM1_P55_S4	We have strategically established our industrial parks in Brazil, China, Hungary, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and the Ukraine.
866374_16_ITEM1_P55_S5	We have selected manufacturing operations situated in low-cost regions of the world to provide our customers with a wide array of manufacturing solutions and low manufacturing costs.
866374_16_ITEM1_P55_S6	As of March 31, 2016 , approximately 76% of our manufacturing capacity was located in low-cost locations, such as Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and the Ukraine.
866374_16_ITEM1_P55_S7	We believe we are a global industry leader in low-cost production capabilities.
866374_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	CUSTOMERS Our customers include many of the world's leading technology companies.
866374_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	We have focused on establishing long-term relationships with our customers and have been successful in expanding our relationships to incorporate additional product lines and services.
866374_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	In fiscal year 2016 , our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 46% of net sales.
866374_16_ITEM1_P56_S3	Only Lenovo/Motorola, a customer in our CTG segment, accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's net sales in fiscal year 2016 .
866374_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Lenovo/Motorola includes net sales from its former parent, Google, up to the point in time when Motorola Mobility was acquired by Lenovo and including net sales from Lenovo thereafter.
866374_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	** Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent includes net sales from its parent Nokia beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, as Nokia's acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent was closed during January 2016.
866374_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	BACKLOG Although we obtain firm purchase orders from our customers, OEM customers typically do not make firm orders for delivery of products more than 30 to 90 days in advance.
866374_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	In addition, OEM customers may reschedule or cancel firm orders depending on contractual arrangements.
866374_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	Therefore, we do not believe that the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales.
866374_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	COMPETITION Our market is extremely competitive and includes many companies, several of which have achieved substantial market share.
866374_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	We compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturing service providers, as well as our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	We face particular competition from Asian-based competitors, including Taiwanese Original Design Manufacturing ("ODM") suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	We compete with different companies depending on the type of service we are providing or the geographic area in which an activity takes place.
866374_16_ITEM1_P59_S4	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the manufacturing services market are quality and range of services, design and technological capabilities; cost; location of facilities; responsiveness and flexibility.
866374_16_ITEM1_P59_S5	We believe we are extremely competitive with regard to all of these factors.
866374_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Our Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility ("CSER") management system has several elements, including environmental, health and safety compliance, labor and human rights, ethics, governance, and community engagement.
866374_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	Flex's CSER framework is based upon the principles, policies, and standards prescribed by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition ("EICC"), a worldwide association of electronics companies committed to promoting an industry code of conduct for global electronics supply chains to improve working and environmental, health and safety conditions as well as other relevant international standards (e.g., ISO 14001).
866374_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	Flex is a founding member of the EICC.
866374_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	Social responsibility is also an area of increasing regulation, with specific regulations such as the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation on Human Trafficking and the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015, all creating new compliance and disclosure obligations for the Company and for our customers.
866374_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	data collection, training and leadership programs that focus upon driving continuous improvements in social, ethical, and environmental performance throughout all of our global operating units, all in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
866374_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Being a good corporate citizen does not mean we should merely conform to standards.
866374_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	We go beyond required responsibilities by offering a wide range of programs and initiatives to engage both our internal and external communities.
866374_16_ITEM1_P62_S2	At the heart of this endeavor lies our pragmatic goal of positively influencing the lives of people in the communities in which we operate.
866374_16_ITEM1_P62_S3	We intend to continue investing in these global communities through grant-making, financial contributions, volunteer work, direct engagement and donation of resources.
866374_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), Section 1502, introduced reporting requirements related to the verification of whether we are directly (or indirectly through suppliers of materials) purchasing the following minerals: columbite-tantalite, also known as coltan (the metal ore from which tantalum is extracted); cassiterite (the metal ore from which tin is extracted); gold; wolframite (the metal ore from which tungsten is extracted); or their derivatives; or any other mineral or its derivatives as determined by the Secretary of State associated with financing conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country.
866374_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	We are working directly with suppliers, industry groups, and customers to comply with the due diligence reporting requirements necessary to comply with this law.
866374_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	We have filed Conflict Minerals reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act.
866374_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
866374_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	We have implemented processes and procedures to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.
866374_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	We do not believe that costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating results, or competitive position.
866374_16_ITEM1_P64_S3	In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third-party sites.
866374_16_ITEM1_P64_S4	We engage environmental consulting firms to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities associated with our ongoing operations, historical disposal activities and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements.
866374_16_ITEM1_P64_S5	We determine the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the probability of occurrence and the reasonable possibility of incurring costs in light of information currently available.
866374_16_ITEM1_P64_S6	The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations, the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by us at our operating facilities, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters.
866374_16_ITEM1_P64_S7	There can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no issue is currently known.
866374_16_ITEM1_P64_S8	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of product environmental compliance regulations focused upon the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_16_ITEM1_P64_S9	EU Directive REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals"), and China RoHS entitled, Management Methods for Controlling Pollution for Electronic Information Products ("EIPs").
866374_16_ITEM1_P64_S10	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including the United States.
866374_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our business requires close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to mitigate risks of non-compliance.
866374_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	We have developed rigorous compliance programs designed to meet the needs and specifications of our customers as well as the regulations.
866374_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	These programs vary from collecting compliance or material data from our Flex controlled or managed suppliers to full laboratory testing, and we include compliance requirements in our standard supplier contracts.
866374_16_ITEM1_P65_S3	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	In the case of WEEE, although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations.
866374_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	Flex continues to monitor developments related to product environmental compliance and is working with our customers and other technical organizations to anticipate and minimize any impacts to our operations.
866374_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	EMPLOYEES As of March 31, 2016 , our global workforce totaled approximately 200,000 employees.
866374_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by work councils.
866374_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	We have never experienced a significant work stoppage or strike, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
866374_16_ITEM1_P67_S3	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees.
866374_16_ITEM1_P67_S4	The loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business, results of operations and business prospects.
866374_16_ITEM1_P67_S5	To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel.
866374_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We own or license various United States and foreign patents relating to a variety of technologies.
866374_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	For certain of our proprietary processes, we rely on trade secret protection.
866374_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	We also have registered our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the United States and other countries throughout the world.
866374_16_ITEM1_P68_S3	As of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , the carrying value of our intellectual property was not material.
866374_16_ITEM1_P68_S4	Although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it, from time to time third parties do assert patent infringement claims against us or our customers.
866374_16_ITEM1_P68_S5	In addition, we provide design and engineering services to our customers and also design and make our own products.
866374_16_ITEM1_P68_S6	As a consequence of these activities, our customers are requiring us to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses.
866374_16_ITEM1_P68_S7	If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_16_ITEM1_P68_S8	Such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor.
866374_16_ITEM1_P68_S9	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome.
866374_16_ITEM1_P68_S10	We also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services.
866374_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS Refer to note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for financial information about our business segments and geographic areas.
866374_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Our Internet address is http://www.flextronics.com.
866374_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	We make available through our Internet website the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
866374_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	We were incorporated in the Republic of Singapore in May 1990.
866374_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	Our principal corporate office is located at 2 Changi South Lane, Singapore 486123.
866374_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	Our U.S. corporate headquarters is located at 6201 America Center Drive, San Jose, CA, 95002.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We derive our revenues from customers in the following business groups:
866374_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	CEC , formerly referred to as INS, which includes radio access base stations, remote radio heads, and small cells for wireless infrastructure; optical, routing, broadcasting, and switching products for the data and video networks; server and storage platforms for both enterprise and cloud based deployments; next generation storage and security appliance products; and rack level solutions, converged infrastructure, and software defined product solutions.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Factors affecting any of these industries in general or our customers in particular, could adversely impact us.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	there may be recessionary periods in our customers' markets, such as the recent global economic downturn.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and our current and potential customers may decide to manufacture some or all of their products internally, which could harm our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Cancellations, reductions, or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers have harmed, and may in the future harm, our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and deliver for these customers, by causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders, and by lowering our asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Additionally, current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our capabilities against other providers as well as against the merits of manufacturing products themselves.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our business would be adversely affected if OEMs decide to perform these functions internally or transfer their business to another provider.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In addition, we face competition from the manufacturing operations of some of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	In the past, some of our customers moved a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Any of these developments could cause a decline in our sales, loss of market acceptance of our products or services, decreases of our profits or loss of our market share.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As a provider of design and manufacturing services and components for electronics, we must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround time for our customers.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and we often experience reduced lead times in customer orders which may be less than the lead time we require to procure necessary components and materials.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of our customers.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	This makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In that regard, we must make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, setting production schedules, making component procurement commitments, and allocating personnel and other resources based on our estimates of our customers' requirements.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production or require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to reduce costs or achieve other objectives.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P4_S6	These demands stress our resources, can cause supply chain management issues, and reduce our margins.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P4_S7	We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands, and transfers from one facility to another can result in inefficiencies and costs due to excess capacity in one facility and corresponding capacity constraints at another.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P4_S8	Many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, thus customer order fluctuations, deferrals, and transfers of demand from one facility to another, as described above, have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past and we may experience such effects in the future.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our industry is extremely competitive; if we are not able to continue to provide competitive services, we may lose business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We compete with a number of different companies, depending on the type of service we provide or the location of our operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	For example, we compete with major global EMS providers, other smaller EMS companies that have a regional or product-specific focus and ODMs with respect to some of the services that we provide.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We also compete with our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our industry is extremely competitive, many of our competitors have achieved substantial market share, and some may have lower cost structures or greater design, manufacturing, financial or other resources than we do.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P5_S5	We face particular competition from Asian-based competitors, including Taiwanese ODM suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If we are unable to provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at lower cost than the other companies in our market, our net sales could decline.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P5_S7	A significant percentage of our sales come from a small number of customers and a decline in sales to any of these customers could adversely affect our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Sales to our ten largest customers represent a significant percentage of our net sales.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 46% , 50% and 52% of net sales in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P5_S10	Only Lenovo/Motorola (including net sales from its former parent, Google, up to the point in time when Motorola Mobility was acquired by Lenovo and including net sales from Lenovo thereafter), which is reflected in our CTG segment, accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our principal customers have varied from year to year.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These customers may experience dramatic declines in their market shares or competitive position, due to economic or other forces, that may cause them to reduce their purchases from us or, in some cases, result in the termination of their relationship with us.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Significant reductions in sales to any of these customers, or the loss of major customers, would materially harm our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If we are not able to timely replace expired, canceled or reduced contracts with new business, our revenues and profitability could be harmed.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Our components business is dependent on our ability to quickly launch world-class components products, and our investment in the development of our component capabilities, together with the start-up and integration costs necessary to achieve quick launches of world-class components products, may adversely affect our margins and profitability.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Our components business, which includes rigid and flexible printed circuit board fabrication, and power supply manufacturing, is part of our strategy to improve our competitive position and to grow our future margins, profitability and shareholder returns by expanding our capabilities.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S6	The success of our components business is dependent on our ability to design and introduce world- class components that have performance characteristics which are suitable for a broad market and that offer significant price and/or performance advantages over competitive products.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S7	To create these world class components offerings, we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our components capabilities, in resources such as research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, facility expansions and personnel requirements.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S8	We may not be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance for any of our components offerings in any of our current or target markets.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S9	The success of our components business will also depend upon the level of market acceptance of our customers' end products, which incorporate our components, and over which we have no control.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S10	In addition, OEMs often require unique configurations or custom designs, which must be developed and integrated in the OEM's product well before the OEM launches the product.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S11	Thus, there is often substantial lead-time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized component and the commencement of volume shipments of the component to the OEM.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S12	As a result, we may make substantial investments in the development and customization of products for our customers, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not accept the customized component.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S13	Even if our customers accept the customized component, if our customers do not purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Our achievement of anticipated levels of profitability in our components business is also dependent on our ability to achieve efficiencies in our manufacturing as well as to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our OEM customers.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S15	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability in our components business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S16	Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S17	We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P6_S18	If some of our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our products from these customers could decline.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivable are outstanding.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	On April 21, 2016, SunEdison, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries ("SunEdison") filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we recognized approximately $61.0 million in charges for provisions of accounts receivable associated with our outstanding SunEdison receivables.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The estimates underlying our recorded provisions, as well as consideration of other potential customer bankruptcy-related contingencies associated with the SunEdison bankruptcy proceedings, are based on the facts currently known to us.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If these facts change, the provisions are subject to change or we could recognize additional charges, either of which could be material.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We may be adversely affected by shortages of required electronic components.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	From time to time, we have experienced shortages of some of the electronic components that we use.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S6	These shortages can result from strong demand for those components or from problems experienced by suppliers, such as shortages of raw materials.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S7	These unanticipated component shortages could result in curtailed production or delays in production, which may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a reduction in sales, increase in inventory levels and costs, and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Component shortages may also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S10	As a result, component shortages could adversely affect our operating results.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to incorporate changes in component costs into the selling prices for our products.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S12	Our supply chain may also be impacted by other events outside our control, including macro-economic events, political crises or natural or environmental occurrences.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P8_S13	Our margins and profitability may be adversely affected due to substantial investments, start-up and production ramp costs in our design services.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	As part of our strategy to enhance our end-to-end service offerings, we continue to expand our design and engineering capabilities.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Providing these services can expose us to different or greater potential risks than those we face when providing our manufacturing services.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Although we enter into contracts with our design services customers, we may design and develop products for these customers prior to receiving a purchase order or other firm commitment from them.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We are required to make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Even if our customers accept our designs, if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our design activities often require that we purchase inventory for initial production runs before we have a purchase commitment from a customer.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Even after we have a contract with a customer with respect to a product, these contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any particular volume of purchases.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P9_S7	These contracts can generally be terminated on short notice.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P9_S8	In addition, some of the products we design and develop must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some must receive government certifications.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P9_S9	If we fail to obtain these approvals or certifications on a timely basis, we would be unable to sell these products, which would harm our sales, profitability and reputation.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our design services offerings require significant investments in research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, patent applications, facility expansion and recruitment.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We may not be able to achieve a high enough level of sales for this business to be profitable.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The initial costs of investing in the resources necessary to expand our design and engineering capabilities, and in particular to support our design services offerings, have historically adversely affected our profitability, and may continue to do so as we continue to make investments to grow these capabilities.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	In addition, we agree to certain product price limitations and cost reduction targets in connection with these services.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Inflationary and other increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor required to produce the products have occurred and may recur from time to time.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Also, the production ramps for these programs are typically significant and negatively impact our margin in early stages as the manufacturing volumes are lower and result in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We may not be able to reduce costs, incorporate changes in costs into the selling prices of our products, or increase operating efficiencies as we ramp production of our products, which would adversely affect our margins and our results of operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to the risks inherent in international operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The geographic distances between the Americas, Asia and Europe create a number of logistical and communications challenges for us.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	These challenges include managing operations across multiple time zones, directing the manufacture and delivery of products across distances, coordinating procurement of components and raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations, and coordinating the activities and decisions of the core management team, which is based in a number of different countries.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Facilities in several different locations may be involved at different stages of the production process of a single product, leading to additional logistical difficulties.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Because our manufacturing operations are located in a number of countries throughout the Americas, Asia and Europe, we are subject to risks of changes in economic and political conditions in those countries, including:
866374_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	a potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The attractiveness of our services to U.S. customers can be affected by changes in U.S. trade policies, such as most favored nation status and trade preferences for some Asian countries.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, some countries in which we operate, such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Mexico, Malaysia and Poland, have experienced periods of slow or negative growth, high inflation, significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Furthermore, in countries such as China, Brazil and Mexico, governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy, and their actions could have a significant effect on us.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure, including lack of adequate power and water supplies, transportation, raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	In addition, we may encounter labor disruptions and rising labor costs, in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Any increase in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P13_S8	In some countries, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert our cash distributions to U.S. dollars or other freely convertible currencies, or to move funds from our accounts in these countries.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P13_S9	Furthermore, the central bank of any of these countries may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to approve distributions to foreign investors.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The success of certain of our activities depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We retain certain intellectual property rights to some of the technologies that we develop as part of our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The measures we have taken to prevent unauthorized use of our technology may not be successful.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties, as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our customers.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, our customers are increasingly requiring us to indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S6	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S7	In the event of such an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S8	We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly, and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of outcome.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S10	If our IT or physical security systems are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S11	We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information systems.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S12	We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P14_S13	We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and inventory and protecting our customers' and our suppliers' confidential information.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools, we are subject to, and at times have suffered from, breach of these security systems which have in the past and may in the future result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or unauthorized use or theft of the inventory or information we are trying to protect.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If unauthorized parties gain physical access to our inventory or if they gain electronic access to our information systems or if such information or inventory is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information or inventory could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties including our customers and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information or inventory, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	If our compliance policies are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We have implemented local and global compliance policies to ensure compliance with our legal obligations across our operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	A significant legal risk resulting from our international operations is compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local laws of the countries in which we do business, including the UK Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits covered companies from making payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our Code of Business Conduct prohibits corrupt payments on a global basis and precludes us from offering or giving anything of value to a government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, to win a business advantage or to improperly influence a decision regarding Flex.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents will refrain from taking actions in violation of this and our related anti-corruption policies and procedures.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S10	We are subject to risks relating to litigation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S11	From time to time, we are involved in various claims, suits, investigations and legal proceedings.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Additional legal claims or regulatory matters may arise in the future and could involve matters relating to commercial disputes, government regulatory and compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax, employment or shareholder issues, product liability claims and other issues on a global basis.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S13	Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be both time- consuming and disruptive to our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P15_S14	The defense and ultimate outcome of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operating expenses and a decrease in operating margin, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of "conflict minerals" may result in increased costs and risks to us.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals ("Minerals"), which may be mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In May 2014, we filed our initial report on Form SD to report that our products were "DRC Conflict Undeterminable" based on our diligence review.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We expect to undertake further diligence of our supply chain in 2016 and beyond as we will have to publicly disclose whether the products we sell contain these Minerals and have and may continue to incur significant costs related to implement a process that will meet the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Additionally, customers rely on us to provide critical data regarding the products they purchase and request information on such Minerals.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our materials sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and we may not be able to easily verify the origins of the Minerals used in the products we sell.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We have many suppliers and each may provide the required information in a different manner, if at all.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, our reputation may suffer if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the Minerals, if any, used in our products.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of any Minerals originating in the specified countries.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S7	The implementation of this requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from our suppliers.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S8	This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide products and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S9	We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for medical devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S10	As a medical device manufacturer, we have additional compliance requirements.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S11	We are required to register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S12	Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring by the FDA.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S13	If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance with QSR or other FDA regulations, and the Company does not address the observation adequately to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA may take action against us.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S14	FDA actions may include issuing a letter of inspectional observations, issuing a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the Company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, refusing requests for clearance or approval of new products or withdrawal of clearance or approval previously granted, issuing an import detention on products entering the U.S. from an offshore facility, or shutting down a manufacturing facility.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P18_S15	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In the European Union ("EU"), we are required to maintain certain standardized certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections to obtain and maintain these certifications.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Continued noncompliance to the EU regulations could stop the flow of products into the EU from us or from our customers.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In China, the Safe Food and Drug Administration controls and regulates the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We must comply with the regulatory laws applicable to medical device manufactures or our ability to manufacture products in China could be impacted.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In Japan, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws regulate the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	These regulations also require that subcontractors manufacturing products intended for sale in Japan register with authorities and submit to regulatory audits.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Other Asian countries where we operate have similar laws regarding the regulation of medical device manufacturing.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We are subject to the risk of increased income taxes.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our continued ability to qualify for specific tax holiday extensions will depend on, among other things, our anticipated investment and expansion in these countries and the manner in which the local governments interpret the requirements for modifications, extensions or new incentives.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions around the world.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	However, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax provision, operating results, financial position and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If our products or components contain defects, demand for our services may decline and we may be exposed to product liability and product warranty liability.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation and expose us to product liability or product warranty claims.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Product liability claims may include liability for personal injury or property damage.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Product warranty claims may include liability to pay for the recall, repair or replacement of a product or component.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Although we generally allocate liability for these claims in our contracts with our customers, increasingly we are unsuccessful in allocating such liability, and even where we have allocated liability to our customers, our customers may not have the resources to satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product or component for which they have assumed responsibility.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S5	If we design, engineer or manufacture a product or component that is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could spend a significant amount of money to resolve the claim.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S6	In addition, product liability and product recall insurance coverage are expensive and may not be available for some or all of our services offerings on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S7	A successful product liability or product warranty claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied, limited or is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S8	Our failure to comply with environmental laws could adversely affect our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S9	We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including regulations governing the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used in our manufacturing processes.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S10	We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the recyclability of products, the materials that may be included in products, and our obligations to dispose of these products after end users have finished with them.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S11	Additionally, we may be exposed to liability to our customers relating to the materials that may be included in the components that we procure for our customers' products.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S12	Any violation or alleged violation by us of environmental laws could subject us to significant costs, fines or other penalties.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S13	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of global and local product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S14	We are subject to the EU directives, including the Restrictions on RoHS, the WEEE as well as the EU's REACH regulation.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P24_S15	In addition, new technical classifications of e-Waste being discussed in the Basel Convention technical working group could affect both our customers' abilities and obligations in electronics repair and refurbishment.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Also of note is China's Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by EIPs regulation, commonly referred to as "China RoHS", which restricts the importation into and production within China of electrical equipment containing certain hazardous materials.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as applicable regulations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	These programs may include collecting compliance data from our suppliers, full laboratory testing and public reporting of other environmental metrics such as carbon emissions, electronic waste and water, and we also require our supply chain to comply.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In the case of WEEE, the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	However, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their obligations under WEEE.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S5	In addition, we are responsible for the cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S6	If more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed, or the results of future testing and analyses at our current or former operating facilities indicate that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the air, ground and/or water, we may be subject to additional liability.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Additional environmental matters may arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations or adequately address contaminated sites could limit our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to incur significant expenses, which would harm our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S9	If we do not effectively manage changes in our operations, our business may be harmed; we have taken substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may need to take material restructuring charges in the future.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S10	The expansion of our business, as well as business contractions and other changes in our customers' requirements, have in the past, and may in the future, require that we adjust our business and cost structures by incurring restructuring charges.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P27_S11	Restructuring activities involve reductions in our workforce at some locations and closure of certain facilities.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	systems and resources, including decision support, accounting management, information systems and facilities.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If we do not properly manage our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures to manage our employees, our business could be harmed.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In recent years, including during fiscal year 2014, we undertook initiatives to restructure our business operations through a series of restructuring activities, which were intended to realign our global capacity and infrastructure with demand by our OEM customers and thereby improve our operational efficiency.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	These activities included reducing excess workforce and capacity, transitioning manufacturing to lower-cost locations and eliminating redundant facilities, and consolidating and eliminating certain administrative facilities.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P28_S4	While we incur severance, asset impairment charges and other charges as a result of changes in our customer mix on an ongoing basis, such individual actions were not considered material and did not qualify as restructuring charges per accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to be separately disclosed as restructuring charges in fiscal year 2015, and are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Our restructuring activities undertaken during fiscal year 2014 have been disclosed separately on our statement of operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P28_S6	We may be required to take additional charges in the future to align our operations and cost structures with global economic conditions, market demands, cost competitiveness, and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers' production requirements.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P28_S7	We may consolidate certain manufacturing facilities or transfer certain of our operations to lower cost geographies.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P28_S8	If we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P28_S9	Additionally, there are other potential risks associated with our restructurings that could adversely affect us, such as delays encountered with the finalization and implementation of the restructuring activities, work stoppages, and the failure to achieve targeted cost savings.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our operating costs.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We have manufacturing operations and industrial parks that are located in lower cost regions of the world, such as Asia, Eastern Europe and Mexico.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	A portion of our purchases and our sale transactions are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in these currencies impacting our fixed cost overhead or our supply base relative to the currencies in which we conduct transactions.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors, including changes in a country's political and economic policies.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Volatility in the functional and non-functional currencies of our entities and the United States dollar could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The primary impact of currency exchange fluctuations is on the cash, receivables, payables and expenses of our operating entities.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As part of our currency hedging strategy, we use financial instruments, primarily forward exchange and swap contracts, to hedge our foreign currency exposure in order to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on our operating results.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If our hedging activities are not successful or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected fluctuations in our operating results as a result of changes in exchange rates.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We are also exposed to risks related to the valuation of the Chinese currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Chinese currency is the renminbi ("RMB").
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	A significant increase in the value of the RMB could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows by increasing both our manufacturing costs and the costs of our local supply base.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We depend on our executive officers and skilled management personnel.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Generally, our employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S5	We could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S6	We will need to recruit and retain skilled management personnel, and if we are not able to do so, our business could be harmed.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S7	In addition, in connection with expanding our design services offerings, we must attract and retain experienced design engineers.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S8	There is substantial competition in our industry for highly skilled employees.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S9	Our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our design services offerings, which could adversely affect our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S10	Failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in the payment of significant damages, which would reduce our net income.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S11	We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, wages and overtime, discrimination, whistle-blowing, classification of employees and severance payments.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S12	Enforcement activity relating to these laws, particularly outside of the United States, can increase as a result of increased media attention due to violations by other companies, changes in law, political and other factors.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P32_S13	There can be no assurance that we won't be found to have violated such laws in the future, due to a more aggressive enforcement posture by governmental authorities or for any other reason.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	such violations could lead to the assessment of fines against us by federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees, which fines could be substantial and which would reduce our net income.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We may encounter difficulties with acquisitions and divestures, which could harm our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We have completed numerous acquisitions of businesses and we may acquire additional businesses in the future.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Any future acquisitions may require additional equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, or additional debt financing, which could increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P33_S5	As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P33_S6	To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P33_S7	The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P33_S8	The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P33_S9	In addition, the integration of acquired businesses may require that we incur significant restructuring charges.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P33_S10	In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including:
866374_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In addition, divestitures involve significant risks, including without limitation, difficulty finding financially sufficient buyers or selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and, under certain circumstances, require us to record impairment charges or a loss as a result of the transaction.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, completing divestitures requires expenses and management attention and could leave us with certain continuing liabilities.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	These and other factors have harmed, and in the future could harm, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition or divestiture, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Our strategic relationships with major customers create risks.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P34_S6	In the past, we have completed numerous strategic transactions with OEM customers.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Under these arrangements, we generally acquire inventory, equipment and other assets from the OEM, and lease or acquire their manufacturing facilities, while simultaneously entering into multi-year manufacturing and supply agreements for the production of their products.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P34_S8	We may pursue these OEM divestiture transactions in the future.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P34_S9	These arrangements entered into with divesting OEMs typically involve many risks, including the following:
866374_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	if demand for the OEMs' products declines, the OEM may reduce its volume of purchases, and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other OEMs.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, these strategic arrangements have not, and in the future may not, result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings per share.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, may not align with our business strategies and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers and other third parties.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Changes in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	For example, significant changes to revenue recognition rules have been enacted and will begin to apply to us in fiscal year 2019 as the FASB has proposed.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Changes to accounting rules or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our business and operations could be adversely impacted by climate change initiatives.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Concern over climate change has led to international legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to seasonal demand.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Two of our significant end markets are the mobile devices market and the consumer devices market.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S4	These markets exhibit particular strength generally in the two quarters leading up to the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S5	As a result, we have historically experienced stronger revenues in our second and third fiscal quarters as compared to our other fiscal quarters.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Economic or other factors leading to diminished orders in the end of the calendar year could harm our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Our debt level may create limitations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S8	As of March 31, 2016 , our total debt was approximately $2.8 billion .
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S9	This level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S10	Changes in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital or to borrow additional funds.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S11	We may also be exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our outstanding borrowings and investments.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S12	Our credit is rated by credit rating agencies.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S13	Our 4.625% Notes, our 5.000% Notes, and our 4.750% Notes, are currently rated BBB- by Standard and Poor's ("S P") which is considered to be investment grade by S P, while rated Ba1 by Moody s which is considered below investment grade by Moody's.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P39_S14	Any further decline in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all, negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares, increase our interest payments under some of our existing debt agreements, and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	facilities is subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit ratings change.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Thus, any potential future negative change in our credit rating may increase the interest rate payable on these credit facilities.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk under our variable rate terms loans, bilateral facilities and revolving credit facility for indebtedness we have incurred or may incur under such borrowings.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	The interest rates under these borrowings are based on either (i) a margin over LIBOR or (ii) the base rate (the greatest of the agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin, in each case depending on our credit rating.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Refer to the discussion in note 7, "Bank Borrowings and Long-Term Debt" to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our debt obligations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P40_S5	We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our invested cash balances, our securitization facilities and our factoring activities.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Weak global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and access to capital markets.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which our customers compete.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Adverse worldwide economic conditions may create challenging conditions in the electronics industry.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	These conditions may result in reduced consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries, a tightening in the credit markets, a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets and high volatility in credit, fixed income and equity markets.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In addition, longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other corporate purposes.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters, geopolitical conditions, terrorist activity, public health issues, cyber security incidents, interruptions of service from utilities, transportation or telecommunications providers, or other catastrophic events.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P42_S7	While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	However, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P43_S4	The policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of self-insurance.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Our business could be adversely affected by any delays, or increased costs, resulting from issues that our common carriers are dealing with in transporting our materials, our products, or both.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We rely on a variety of common carriers to transport our materials from our suppliers to us, and to transport our products from us to our customers.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Problems suffered by any of these common carriers, whether due to a natural disaster, labor problem, increased energy prices, criminal activity or some other issue, could result in shipping delays, increased costs, or other supply chain disruptions, and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We are subject to risks associated with investments.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We invest in private funds and companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We make investments in private funds and companies to further our strategic objectives, support key business initiatives and develop business relationships with related portfolio companies.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	If any of the funds or companies in which we invest fail, we could lose all or part of our investment.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P45_S5	If we need to determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we would need to write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The market price of our ordinary shares is volatile.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of companies, including technology companies.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These fluctuations have often been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Factors such as fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of technological innovations or events affecting other companies in the electronics industry, currency fluctuations, general market fluctuations, and macro-economic conditions may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We also ascribe value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships, developed technology and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if we determine that the fair values of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We evaluate, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Refer to notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements and 'critical accounting policies' in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P49_S5	A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of our businesses and we could be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact our consolidated balance sheet, as well as our consolidated statement of operations.
866374_16_ITEM1A_P49_S6	If we are required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact our consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under our existing credit facilities, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.
866374_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our facilities include large industrial parks, ranging in size from 0.3 million to 4.5 million square feet in Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and the Ukraine.
866374_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also have regional manufacturing operations, generally ranging in size from under 100,000 to approximately 2.7 million square feet in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the Ukraine and the United States.
866374_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also have smaller design and engineering centers and product introduction centers at a number of locations in the world's major consumer electronics and industrial markets.
866374_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	Our facilities are well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted.
866374_16_ITEM2_P0_S4	The productive capacity of our plants is adequate for current needs.
866374_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low per share sales prices for our ordinary shares since the beginning of fiscal year 2015 as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
866374_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of May 11, 2016 there were 3,274 holders of record of our ordinary shares and the closing sales price of our ordinary shares as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was $12.04 per share.
866374_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	DIVIDENDS Since inception, we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares.
866374_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	We currently do not have plans to pay any dividends in fiscal year 2017 .

866374_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table provides information regarding purchases of our ordinary shares made by us for the period from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016 .
866374_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	(1) During the period from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016 all purchases were made pursuant to the program discussed below in open market transactions.

866374_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	(2) On August 20, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our outstanding ordinary shares for up to $500 million.
866374_16_ITEM5_P7_S1	This is in accordance with the share purchase mandate whereby our shareholders approved a repurchase limit of 20% of our issued ordinary shares outstanding at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on the same date as the Board authorization.
866374_16_ITEM5_P7_S2	As of March 31, 2016 , shares in the aggregate amount of $242.1 million were available to be repurchased under the current plan.
866374_16_ITEM5_P8_S0	RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES None.
866374_16_ITEM5_P9_S0	INCOME TAXATION UNDER SINGAPORE LAW Dividends.
866374_16_ITEM5_P9_S1	Singapore does not impose a withholding tax on dividends.
866374_16_ITEM5_P9_S2	All dividends are tax exempt to shareholders.
866374_16_ITEM5_P10_S0	Under current Singapore tax law there is no tax on capital gains, thus any profits from the disposal of shares are not taxable in Singapore unless the gains arising from the disposal of shares are income in nature and subject to tax, especially if they arise from activities which the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore regards as the carrying on of a trade or business in Singapore (in which case, the profits on the sale would be taxable as trade profits rather than capital gains).
866374_16_ITEM5_P10_S1	Shareholders who apply, or who are required to apply, the Singapore Financial Reporting Standard 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement ("FRS 39") for the purposes of Singapore income tax may be required to recognize gains or losses (not being gains or losses in the nature of capital) in accordance with the provisions of FRS 39 (as modified by the applicable provisions of Singapore income tax law) even though no sale or disposal of shares is made.
866374_16_ITEM5_P11_S0	There is no stamp duty payable for holding shares, and no duty is payable on the issue of new shares.
866374_16_ITEM5_P11_S1	When existing shares are acquired in Singapore, a stamp duty of 0.2% is payable on the instrument of transfer of the shares at market value.
866374_16_ITEM5_P11_S2	The stamp duty is borne by the purchaser unless there is an agreement to the contrary.
866374_16_ITEM5_P11_S3	If the instrument of transfer is executed outside of Singapore, the stamp duty must be paid only if the instrument of transfer is received in Singapore.
866374_16_ITEM5_P12_S0	The estate duty was abolished for deaths occurring on or after February 15, 2008.
866374_16_ITEM5_P13_S0	For deaths prior to February 15, 2008 the following rules apply: If an individual who is not domiciled in Singapore dies on or after January 1, 2002, no estate tax is payable in Singapore on any of our shares held by the individual.
866374_16_ITEM5_P13_S1	If property passing upon the death of an individual domiciled in Singapore includes our shares, Singapore estate duty is payable to the extent that the value of the shares aggregated with any other assets subject to Singapore estate duty exceeds S$600,000.
866374_16_ITEM5_P13_S2	Unless other exemptions apply to the other assets, for example, the separate exemption limit for residential properties, any excess beyond S$600,000 will be taxed at 5% on the first S$12,000,000 of the individual's chargeable assets and thereafter at 10%.
866374_16_ITEM5_P14_S0	An individual shareholder who is a U.S. citizen or resident (for U.S. estate tax purposes) will have the value of the shares included in the individual's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes.
866374_16_ITEM5_P14_S1	An individual shareholder generally will be entitled to a tax credit against the shareholder's U.S. estate tax to the extent the individual shareholder actually pays Singapore estate tax on the value of the shares; however, such tax credit is generally limited to the percentage of the U.S. estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the value of the shares included in the shareholder's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes, adjusted further by a pro rata apportionment of available exemptions.
866374_16_ITEM5_P14_S2	Individuals who are domiciled in Singapore should consult their own tax advisors regarding the Singapore estate tax consequences of their investment.
866374_16_ITEM5_P14_S3	There is no reciprocal income tax treaty between the U.S. and Singapore regarding withholding taxes on dividends and capital gains.
866374_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	Other income, net in the fiscal year 2013 includes the fair value change in warrants to purchase common shares of a certain supplier of $74.4 million and loss on sale of two investments.
866374_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	Other income, net in the fiscal year 2012, relates to the $20.0 million gain on sale of certain international entities.
866374_16_ITEM6_P0_S2	(2) During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, the Company identified certain accounting errors in the statutory-to-U.S. GAAP adjustments at one of its foreign sites that originated in prior annual periods.
866374_16_ITEM6_P0_S3	Management conducted additional procedures and concluded that these errors were isolated to that location.
866374_16_ITEM6_P0_S4	These errors, which primarily understated cost of sales, totaled $10.4 million and $8.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively, and were corrected by the Company as an out-of-period adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.
866374_16_ITEM6_P0_S5	Management believes the impact of this item, to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and to prior fiscal years was not material.
866374_16_ITEM6_P0_S6	As a result of recording these adjustments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, net income for the year ended March 31, 2012 was reduced by $24.9 million ($0.03 per share).
866374_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	(3) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.
866374_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	(4) During fiscal year 2014, a previously wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company issued a noncontrolling equity interest to certain third party investors in exchange for $38.6 million in cash for an ownership interest of less than 20% of the outstanding shares in the subsidiary.
866374_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	Accordingly, as of March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the noncontrolling interest has been included on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of total shareholders' equity.
866374_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	OVERVIEW We are a globally-recognized, leading provider of innovative design, engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain services and solutions that span from sketch to scale tm ; from conceptual sketch to full-scale production.
866374_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	includes our mobile devices business, including smart phones; our consumer electronics business, including connected living, wearable electronics including digital sport, game consoles, and connectivity devices; and our high-volume computing business, including various supply chain solutions for notebook personal computer ("PC"), tablets, and printers; in addition, our CTG group is expanding its business relationships to include supply chain optimization for non-electronics products such as shoes and clothing; Industrial and Emerging Industries ("IEI"), which is comprised of semiconductor and capital equipment, office solutions, household industrial and lifestyle, industrial automation and kiosks, energy and metering, and lighting; and Communications Enterprise Compute (" CEC "), formerly referred to as Integrated Network Solutions ( INS ), which includes radio access base stations, remote radio heads, and small cells for wireless infrastructure; optical, routing, broadcasting, and switching products for the data and video networks; server and storage platforms for both enterprise and cloud based deployments; next generation storage and security appliance products; and rack level solutions, converged infrastructure and software defined product solutions.
866374_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	On July 23, 2015, we introduced our new brand and website to help us more efficiently manage our business opportunities and explain our new product and service offerings.
866374_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	We shortened our brand name from Flextronics to Flex to signify that our business continues to evolve past the boundaries and confines of electronics alone.
866374_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our new tag line, Live Smarter highlights our belief that all devices are becoming intelligent and that value will ultimately be created in the intelligence of things and the convergence of technologies and digitization of products across multiple industries and market segments.
866374_16_ITEM7_P1_S4	Our strategy is to provide customers with a full range of cost competitive, vertically-integrated global supply chain solutions through which we can design, build, ship and service a complete packaged product for our OEM customers.
866374_16_ITEM7_P1_S5	This enables our OEM customers to leverage our supply chain solutions to meet their product requirements throughout the entire product life cycle.
866374_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Over the past few years, we have seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, primarily in the technology sector.
866374_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Some companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, Internet service providers or e-commerce retailers have entered the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology hardware markets, such as mobile devices, home entertainment and wearable devices.
866374_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	This trend has resulted in a significant change in the manufacturing and supply chain solutions requirements of such companies.
866374_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	While the products have become more complex, the supply chain solutions required by such companies have become more customized and demanding, and it has changed the manufacturing and supply chain landscape significantly.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	We use a portfolio approach to manage our extensive service offerings.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	As our OEM customers change the way they go to market, we are able to reorganize and rebalance our business portfolio in order to align with our customers' needs and requirements in an effort to optimize operating results.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	The objective of our business model is to allow us to be flexible and redeploy and reposition our assets and resources as necessary to meet specific customer's supply chain solutions needs across all of the markets we serve and earn a return on our invested capital above the weighted average cost of that capital.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	During the past few years, we have made significant efforts to evolve our long-term portfolio towards a higher mix of businesses which possess longer product life cycles and higher margins such as reflected in our IEI and HRS businesses.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	During the last two fiscal years, we launched several programs broadly across our portfolio of services and in some instances we deployed certain new technologies.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S5	Some of these programs have started to yield better results, as demonstrated by our segment operating margin improvement while our sales decreased compared to the prior year.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S6	We continue to invest in innovation and we have expanded our design and engineering relationships through our product innovation centers.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S7	We believe that our business transformation has strategically positioned us to take advantage of the long-term, future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities, design and engineering services and after-market services, which remain strong.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S8	We are one of the world's largest providers of global supply chain solutions, with revenues of $24.4 billion in fiscal year 2016 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S9	We have established an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world's major consumer electronics and industrial markets (Asia, the Americas, and Europe) in order to serve the growing outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S10	We design, build, ship, and service consumer electronics and industrial products for our customers through a network of over 100 facilities in approximately 30 countries across four continents.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S11	As of March 31, 2016 , our total manufacturing capacity was approximately 26.0 million square feet.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S12	In fiscal year 2016 , our net sales in Asia, the Americas and Europe represented approximately 48% , 34% and 18% , respectively, of our total net sales, based on the location of the manufacturing site.
866374_16_ITEM7_P3_S13	The following tables set forth net sales and net property and equipment, by country, based on the location of our manufacturing sites and the relative percentages:
866374_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	We believe that the combination of our extensive open innovation platform solutions, design and engineering services, advanced supply chain management solutions and services, significant scale and global presence, and industrial campuses in low-cost geographic areas provide us with a competitive advantage and strong differentiation in the market for designing, manufacturing and servicing consumer electronics and industrial products for leading multinational and regional OEMs.
866374_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Specifically, we have launched multiple product innovation centers ("PIC") focused exclusively on offering our customers the ability to simplify their global product development, manufacturing process, and after sales services, and enable them to meaningfully accelerate their time to market and cost savings.
866374_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including the following:
866374_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Net sales for fiscal year 2016 declined from the prior year, decreasing by 6.6% or $1.7 billion to $24.4 billion .
866374_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	The decrease was primarily due to a $1.9 billion decrease in our CTG segment as well as a $0.3 billion decrease in our CEC segment, partially offset by increases in our HRS segment by $0.3 billion and our IEI segment by $0.2 billion .
866374_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our fiscal year 2016 gross profit totaled $1.6 billion , representing an increase of $62.7 million , or 4.1% , which reflects a richer mix of business driven primarily from our HRS and IEI segments and improved operational execution while ramping new customers and programs during fiscal year 2016.
866374_16_ITEM7_P5_S3	Our net income totaled $444.1 million , representing a decrease of $156.7 million , or 26.1% , compared to fiscal year 2015.
866374_16_ITEM7_P5_S4	The decrease in net income during fiscal year 2016 is primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense, incremental costs associated with our acquisitions of MCi and NEXTracker, and a bad debt expense charge related to the SunEdison bankruptcy announcement.
866374_16_ITEM7_P5_S5	Cash provided by operations increased approximately $0.3 billion to $1.1 billion for the fiscal year 2016 compared with $0.8 billion for the fiscal year 2015 primarily due to favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P5_S6	Cash used in investing activities increased approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2016 compared with $0.2 billion for fiscal year 2015 primarily from $916.5 million paid for the acquisition of eleven businesses completed during fiscal year 2016.
866374_16_ITEM7_P5_S7	Our average net working capital, defined as accounts receivable, including deferred purchase price receivable from our asset-backed securitization programs plus inventory less accounts payable, as a percentage of annualized sales decreased by 0.1% to 7.7% .
866374_16_ITEM7_P5_S8	Our free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment, was $639.5 million for fiscal year 2016 compared to $554.3 million for fiscal year 2015 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P5_S9	The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to higher cash flows from operations offset by higher net expenditures during fiscal year 2016 as we thoughtfully invested in capabilities and capacity in advance of revenue to reinforce our growing automotive, medical, and energy businesses, as well as support our innovation and sketch-to-scale offering.
866374_16_ITEM7_P5_S10	Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for the free cash flows reconciliation to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of cash flows from operations.
866374_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Cash provided by financing activities amounted to $249.6 million during fiscal year 2016 which was primarily the result of net proceeds from bank borrowings and long-term debt of $694.5 million mainly resulting from our new debt issuance discussed further in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, offset by the repurchases of approximately 37.9 million ordinary shares at an aggregate purchase value of $420.3 million .
866374_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
866374_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
866374_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
866374_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	We recognize manufacturing revenue when we ship goods or the goods are received by our customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured.
866374_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Generally, there are no formal substantive customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services.
866374_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	If such requirements or obligations exist, then we recognize the related revenues at the time when such requirements are completed and the obligations are fulfilled.
866374_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Some of our customer contracts allow us to recover certain costs related to manufacturing services that are over and above the prices we charge for the related products.
866374_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	We determine the amount of costs that are recoverable based on historical experiences and agreements with those customers.
866374_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Also, certain customer contracts may contain certain commitments and obligations that may result in additional expenses or decrease in revenue.
866374_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	We accrue for these commitments and obligations based on facts and circumstances and contractual terms.
866374_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	We also make provisions for estimated sales returns and other adjustments at the time revenue is recognized based upon contractual terms and an analysis of historical returns.
866374_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	Provisions for sales returns and other adjustments were not material to our consolidated financial statements for any of the periods presented.
866374_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	We provide a comprehensive suite of services for our customers that range from advanced product design to manufacturing and logistics to after-sales services.
866374_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	the related costs are expensed as incurred.
866374_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our net sales for services were less than 10% of our total sales for all periods presented, and accordingly, are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	We have an established customer credit policy through which we manage customer credit exposures through credit evaluations, credit limit setting, monitoring, and enforcement of credit limits for new and existing customers.
866374_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and make provisions for doubtful accounts based on the outcome of those credit evaluations.
866374_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances, current economic trends, historical experience with collections and the age of past due receivables.
866374_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	To the extent we identify exposures as a result of credit or customer evaluations, we also review other customer related exposures, including but not limited to inventory and related contractual obligations.
866374_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	On April 21, 2016, one of our customers, SunEdison, Inc. (together with certain of its subsidiaries, "SunEdison"), filed a petition for reorganization under bankruptcy law.
866374_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we recognized approximately $61.0 million in charges for provisions of accounts receivable associated with our outstanding SunEdison receivables.
866374_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	The estimates underlying our recorded provisions, as well as consideration of other potential customer bankruptcy-related contingencies associated with the SunEdison bankruptcy proceedings, are based on the facts currently known to us.
866374_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	If these facts change, the provisions are subject to change or we could recognize additional charges, either of which could be material.
866374_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Restructuring Charges We recognize restructuring charges related to our plans to close or consolidate excess manufacturing and administrative facilities and to realign our corporate cost structure.
866374_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	In connection with these activities, we recognize restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other exit-related costs.
866374_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	The recognition of these restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	To the extent our actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_16_ITEM7_P14_S4	Such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_16_ITEM7_P14_S5	At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_16_ITEM7_P14_S6	Refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets We review property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
866374_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of these long-lived assets exceeds their fair value.
866374_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Recoverability of property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets are measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
866374_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets exceeds fair value.
866374_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our judgments regarding projected cash flows for an extended period of time and the fair value of assets may be impacted by changes in market conditions, general business environment and other factors.
866374_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	To the extent our estimates relating to cash flows and fair value of assets change adversely we may have to recognize additional impairment charges in the future.
866374_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
866374_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors, market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis.
866374_16_ITEM7_P17_S4	The Company performed its goodwill impairment assessment on January 1, 2016 and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test because the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
866374_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Inventory Valuation Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value.
866374_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short-term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand.
866374_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	We purchase our inventory based on forecasted demand, and we estimate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand, and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers.
866374_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	actual market conditions or our customers' product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional write downs may be required.
866374_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	In addition, unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers and/or changes in economic conditions may require additional write downs for inventories due to our customers' inability to fulfill their contractual obligations with regard to inventory procured to fulfill customer demand.
866374_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	We may be exposed to certain liabilities relating to our business operations, acquisitions of businesses and assets and other activities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	We make provisions for such liabilities when it is probable that the settlement of the liability will result in an outflow of economic resources or the impairment of an asset.
866374_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	We make these assessments based on facts and circumstances that may change in the future resulting in additional expenses.
866374_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Income Taxes Our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, which will result in deductible amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards.
866374_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Based on estimates, the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize these deferred income tax assets.
866374_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors.
866374_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets previously recognized, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.
866374_16_ITEM7_P22_S4	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_16_ITEM7_P22_S5	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_16_ITEM7_P22_S6	Refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our tax position.
866374_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies The financial position and results of operations for certain of our subsidiaries are measured using a currency other than the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
866374_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	Accordingly, all assets and liabilities for these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet dates.
866374_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	Revenue and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period.
866374_16_ITEM7_P23_S3	Cumulative gains and losses from the translation of these subsidiaries' financial statements are reported as other comprehensive loss, a component of shareholders' equity.
866374_16_ITEM7_P23_S4	Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved, and re-measurement adjustments for foreign operations where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, are included in operating results.
866374_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales.
866374_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	The data below, and discussion that follows, represents our results from operations.
866374_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Net sales Net sales during fiscal year 2016 totaled $24.4 billion , representing a decrease of $1.7 billion , or 6.6% , from $26.1 billion during fiscal year 2015 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	During fiscal year 2016 , net sales decreased $1.2 billion in Asia, $0.6 billion in the Americas, and $14.7 million in Europe.
866374_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	Net sales during fiscal year 2015 totaled $26.1 billion , representing an increase of $39.3 million , or 0.2% , from $26.1 billion during fiscal year 2014 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	During fiscal year 2015 , net sales increased $0.7 billion in the Americas and $0.1 billion in Europe, offset by a decrease of $0.8 billion in Asia.
866374_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	The following table sets forth net sales by segments and their relative percentages.
866374_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	Historical information has been recast to reflect realignment of customers and/or products between segments:
866374_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2016 decreased $1.9 billion or 21.7% in the CTG segment and $349.6 million or 3.8% in the CEC segment.
866374_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	The drop in CTG was due to a decline in demand from our largest customer in our mobile business offset by expansion across wearables, connected home and gaming markets.
866374_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	The decrease in CEC is primarily attributable to lower sales within our server and storage business.
866374_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	These decreases were partially offset by a $341.7 million or 9.6% increase in sales from our HRS segment, and by a $221.4 million or 5.0% increase in sales from our IEI segment.
866374_16_ITEM7_P27_S4	These increases in HRS and IEI were attributable to an increase across multiple product categories and customers, most notably in our household, energy, automotive, and medical businesses primarily as a result of our strategic acquisitions in both segments referred to below.
866374_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2015 increased $0.7 billion or 17.7% in the IEI segment and $0.3 billion or 8.6% in the HRS segment.
866374_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	The increase in revenue from our IEI segment is primarily attributable to a broad increase across multiple product categories and customers, most notably in our energy and our household industrial and lifestyle businesses.
866374_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	The increased revenue from our HRS segment is primarily due to a higher demand from our medical customers, and greater sales to our automotive customers as a result of an increased use of electronics throughout vehicles in areas such as in-car connectivity, LED lighting, and power management.
866374_16_ITEM7_P28_S3	The increase in these segments was partially offset by a $0.5 billion or 5.1% decrease in sales from our CEC segment, and by a $0.4 billion or 4.5% decrease in sales from our CTG segment.
866374_16_ITEM7_P28_S4	The decrease in revenue in our CEC segment is primarily attributable to broad softness in our telecom businesses directly due to decreased demand for our customer products from North American carriers.
866374_16_ITEM7_P28_S5	The decrease in revenue in our CTG segment is primarily due to softness in our personal computing business.
866374_16_ITEM7_P28_S6	Our ten largest customers during fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 accounted for approximately 46% , 50% and 52% of net sales, respectively.
866374_16_ITEM7_P28_S7	During fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , only Lenovo/Motorola (including net sales from its former parent, Google, up to the point in time when Motorola Mobility was acquired by Lenovo and including net sales from Lenovo thereafter), which is reflected in our CTG segment, accounted for greater than 10% of net sales.
866374_16_ITEM7_P28_S8	Going forward, we do not expect Motorola Mobility to account for greater than 10% of our net sales.
866374_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Gross profit Gross profit is affected by a number of factors, including the number and size of new manufacturing programs, product mix, component costs and availability, product life cycles, unit volumes, pricing, competition, new product introductions, capacity utilization and the expansion and consolidation of manufacturing facilities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	The flexible design of our manufacturing processes allows us to build a broad range of products in our facilities and better utilize our manufacturing capacity.
866374_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	In the cases of new programs, profitability normally lags revenue growth due to product start-up costs, lower manufacturing program volumes in the start-up phase, operational inefficiencies, and under-absorbed overhead.
866374_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	Gross margin for these programs often improves over time as manufacturing volumes increase, as our utilization rates and overhead absorption improve, and as we increase the level of manufacturing services content.
866374_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	As a result of these various factors, our gross margin varies from period to period.
866374_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Gross profit during fiscal year 2016 increased $62.7 million to $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion during fiscal year 2015 reflecting a richer mix of business and improved operational execution while ramping new customers and programs during fiscal year 2016.
866374_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	Gross margin increased to 6.6% of net sales in fiscal year 2016 as compared with 5.9% of net sales in fiscal year 2015 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Gross margins improved 70 basis points in fiscal year 2016 compared to that of fiscal year 2015 due to proportionate increased share of our total revenue attributable to our HRS and IEI segments coupled with their increased profitability primarily driven by our acquisitions of Mirror Controls International ("MCi") and NEXTracker Inc. ("NEXTracker").
866374_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	Gross profit during fiscal year 2015 increased $105.1 million to $1.5 billion from $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2014.
866374_16_ITEM7_P32_S4	Gross margin increased to 5.9% of net sales in fiscal year 2015 as compared with 5.5% of net sales in fiscal year 2014.
866374_16_ITEM7_P32_S5	Gross margins improved 40 basis points in fiscal year 2015 compared to that of fiscal year 2014 due to restructuring charges in fiscal year 2014 in the amount of $58.6 million, or 20 basis points included in cost of sales.
866374_16_ITEM7_P32_S6	There were no restructuring charges in fiscal year 2015.
866374_16_ITEM7_P32_S7	Further, gross margin in fiscal year 2015 improved as a result of increased revenue from our IEI and HRS segments as a percentage of our total revenues overall, which yield higher margins than our CTG and CEC segments, and better than expected execution on certain products, some of which were reaching end of life.
866374_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	An operating segment's performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income.
866374_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Segment income is defined as net sales less cost of sales, and segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and does not include amortization of intangibles, stock based compensation, restructuring charges, certain bad debt charges, other charges (income), net and interest and other, net.
866374_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	A portion of amortization and depreciation is allocated to the respective segment together with other general corporate research and development and administrative expenses.
866374_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	The following table sets forth segment income and margins.
866374_16_ITEM7_P33_S4	Historical information has been recast to reflect realignment of customers and/or products between segments:
866374_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	(1) On April 21, 2016, one of our customers, SunEdison, filed a petition for reorganization under bankruptcy law.
866374_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we recognized a bad debt reserve charge of $61.0 million associated with our outstanding SunEdison receivables.
866374_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	This charge is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations but is excluded from the measurement of the Company's operating segment's performance.
866374_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	Refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this charge.
866374_16_ITEM7_P34_S4	(2) During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, the Company recognized restructuring charges of approximately $75.3 million .
866374_16_ITEM7_P34_S5	The costs associated with these restructuring activities include employee severance, other personnel costs, non-cash impairment charges on equipment no longer in use and to be disposed of, and other exit related costs due to facility closures or rationalizations.
866374_16_ITEM7_P34_S6	Refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these charges.
866374_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	CEC segment margin increased 20 basis points, for fiscal year 2016 , from 2.8% during fiscal year 2015 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	The improvements are driven by favorable product mix changes from new program offerings, higher utilization levels and strong operational execution across multiple customers and facilities, offset by incremental engineering spend as we continue to invest in expanding our capabilities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	CEC segment margin increased 10 basis points, for fiscal year 2015 , from 2.7% during fiscal year 2014 , also as a result of favorable product mix changes during fiscal 2015.
866374_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	CTG segment margin slightly decreased 10 basis points for fiscal year 2016 , from 2.4% during fiscal year 2015 , due primarily to the soft macro economy, notably in Brazil, which impacted consumer business, partially offset by a portfolio shift within the CTG product mix focusing on higher margin consumer electronic products.
866374_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	CTG segment margin increased 110 basis points for fiscal year 2015 , from 1.3% during fiscal year 2014 , primarily attributable to a portfolio shift within the CTG product mix coupled with better execution on certain products some of which were going end of life.
866374_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	IEI segment margin increased 40 basis points to 3.4% for fiscal year 2016 , from 3.0% during fiscal year 2015 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	This is primarily due to strong operational execution and higher utilization levels coupled with contribution from our NEXTracker acquisition that contributed higher margins for the second half of fiscal year 2016.
866374_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	Fiscal year 2015 also included underperformance of certain programs, delayed and inefficient ramps for new programs.
866374_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	IEI segment margin decreased 40 basis points to 3.0% for fiscal year 2015 , from 3.4% during fiscal year 2014 due to operational challenges and underperformance of certain programs during fiscal year 2015 as mentioned above.
866374_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	HRS segment margin increased 120 basis points to 7.6% for fiscal year 2016 , from 6.4% during fiscal year 2015 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	The improvements are primarily due to additional flow through from the increase in revenue from new programs and contribution from our MCi acquisition starting in our second quarter of fiscal year 2016 in addition to greater value-added business engagements due to greater design and engineering solutions as part of our sketch to scale tm offering.
866374_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	decreased 40 basis points to 6.4% for fiscal year 2015 , from 6.8% for fiscal year 2014 primarily as a result of comparatively higher ramp costs for new programs during fiscal 2015.
866374_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Restructuring charges In response to a challenging macroeconomic environment, we initiated certain restructuring activities in fiscal year 2014 to improve our operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce and capacity.
866374_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	There were no material restructuring activities during fiscal years 2016 and 2015.
866374_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	The fiscal year 2014 restructuring activities were intended to realign our corporate cost structure, and rationalize our global manufacturing capacity and infrastructure which will further shift manufacturing capacity to locations with higher efficiencies.
866374_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	During fiscal year 2014, we recognized $75.3 million of pre-tax restructuring charges comprised of $73.4 million of cash charges predominantly related to employee severance costs and $1.9 million of non-cash charges related to asset impairment.
866374_16_ITEM7_P40_S4	The restructuring charges by geographic region amounted to $34.5 million in Asia, $24.9 million in the Americas and $15.9 million in Europe.
866374_16_ITEM7_P40_S5	We classified $58.6 million of the charges incurred in fiscal year 2014 as a component of cost of sales and $16.7 million as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.
866374_16_ITEM7_P40_S6	As of March 31, 2014 all plans had been completed.
866374_16_ITEM7_P40_S7	As of March 31, 2016, accrued costs relating to restructuring charges were $13.2 million of which $2.5 million was classified as a current obligation.
866374_16_ITEM7_P40_S8	As of March 31, 2015, accrued costs relating to restructuring charges were $15.1 million of which $3.5 million was classified as a current obligation.
866374_16_ITEM7_P40_S9	Refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") totaled $954.9 million or 3.9% of net sales, during fiscal year 2016 , compared to $844.5 million , or 3.2% of net sales, during fiscal year 2015 , increasing by $110.4 million or 13.1% .
866374_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	The increase in SG A in dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily the result of an increase in costs associated with research, development and design activities, as we continued to deploy resources to meet the needs of our customers and explore new product innovations, increases in stock-based compensation expense, incremental costs associated with our acquisitions of MCi and NEXTracker both of which drive a higher proportional SG A level, and a bad debt reserve charge associated with our outstanding SunEdison receivables of $61.0 million as a result of SunEdison's bankruptcy filing.
866374_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	SG A totaled $844.5 million or 3.2% of net sales, during fiscal year 2015, compared to $874.8 million, or 3.4% of net sales, during fiscal year 2014, decreasing by $30.3 million or 3.5%.
866374_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	The decrease in SG A in dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily the result of our cost reduction measures that we undertook in fiscal year 2015 and rationalization efforts carried out in fiscal year 2014, partially offset by an approximate $8.9 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation.
866374_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	We recognized research and development costs primarily related to our design and innovations businesses of $75.5 million , $35.2 million , and $30.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
866374_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	Intangible amortization Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal year 2016 increased by $33.9 million to $66.0 million from $32.0 million in fiscal year 2015 , primarily as a result of incremental amortization expense on intangibles assets relating to our acquisitions completed during the fiscal year 2016.
866374_16_ITEM7_P42_S4	Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal year 2015 increased by $3.1 million to $32.0 million from $28.9 million in fiscal year 2014, primarily as a result of customer-related intangibles in connection with our acquisitions and the purchase of certain technology rights during the fiscal year 2015.
866374_16_ITEM7_P42_S5	Other charges (income), net During fiscal year 2016 , we recognized other charges of $47.7 million primarily due to a $26.8 million loss on the disposition of a non-strategic Western European manufacturing facility which included a non cash foreign currency translation loss of $25.3 million , and $21.8 million from the impairment of a non-core investment.
866374_16_ITEM7_P42_S6	These were offset by a non-cash foreign currency translation gain of $4.2 million , as further discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_16_ITEM7_P42_S7	During fiscal year 2015, we recognized other income of $53.2 million principally as a result of the reversal of a contractual obligation with a certain customer recognized during the fiscal year 2014 in the amount of $55.0 million.
866374_16_ITEM7_P42_S8	We executed an amendment to the customer contract during fiscal year 2015 which relieved us of commitment performance as was defined in an existing customer manufacturing agreement.
866374_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	disposition of a manufacturing facility in Western Europe.
866374_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	Further, we recognized a net gain for the sale of a certain investment, which primarily comprises the balance for other income in fiscal year 2015 net of the above items.
866374_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	During fiscal year 2014, we recognized other charges of $57.5 million primarily due to the contractual obligation of $55.0 million discussed above.
866374_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	Additionally, we exercised warrants to purchase common shares of a supplier and sold the underlying shares for a loss of $7.1 million, offset by a gain of $4.6 million recognized in connection with the sales of certain investments.
866374_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Interest and other, net Interest and other, net was $84.8 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to $51.4 million during fiscal year 2015 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	The increase in interest and other, net of $33.4 million was primarily due to a $23.5 million increase of interest expense from the 4.750% Notes issued during the current year as further discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as $8.0 million of acquisition-related costs incurred during fiscal year 2016, primarily for our acquisition of MCi.
866374_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	Interest and other, net was $51.4 million during fiscal year 2015 compared to $61.9 million during fiscal year 2014.
866374_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	The decrease in interest and other, net was primarily due to a gain associated with minority interest from an investment, an increase in foreign currency gains relating to the Chinese RMB, and a decrease in interest expense as a result of refinancing of certain debt facilities during the latter part of fiscal year 2014.
866374_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Income taxes Certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates.
866374_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	The consolidated effective tax rates were 2.3% , 10.4% and 8.7% for the fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	The effective rate varies from the Singapore statutory rate of 17.0% in each year as a result of the following items:
866374_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	The variation in our effective tax rate each year is primarily a result of recognition of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are taxed at rates lower than the Singapore statutory rate including the effect of tax holidays and tax incentives we received primarily for our subsidiaries in China, Malaysia and Israel of $6.6 million, $9.8 million and $15.2 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
866374_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	Additionally, our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions of ($13.7) million , $29.7 million , and ($2.2) million and changes in our valuation allowances on deferred tax assets of $1.0 million , $2.5 million and $26.8 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
866374_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	We generate most of our revenues and profits from operations outside of Singapore.
866374_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examinations, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	We provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that in our estimation are not more likely than not to be realized.
866374_16_ITEM7_P47_S4	During fiscal year 2016, we released valuation allowances totaling $20.3 million primarily related to our operations in Malaysia as these amounts were deemed to be more likely than not to be realized due to the increased profitability of the Malaysian subsidiary during the past three fiscal years following a period of losses as well as continued forecasted profitability of that subsidiary.
866374_16_ITEM7_P47_S5	In addition, we had a $43.0 million credit to tax expense related to the partial release of valuation allowance on our US operations due to the recording of deferred tax liabilities related to intangibles acquired during fiscal year 2016.
866374_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	allowance positions due to increased negative evidence during the period in legal entities which did not previously have valuation allowance recorded.
866374_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	See note 13, "Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion.
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of March 31, 2016 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion and bank and other borrowings of $2.8 billion .
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	We have a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2016 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world.
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S3	As of March 31, 2016 , over half of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries outside of Singapore.
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S4	Although substantially all of the amounts held outside of Singapore could be repatriated, under current laws, a significant amount could be subject to income tax withholdings.
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S5	We provide for tax liabilities on these amounts for financial statement purposes, except for certain of our foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Singapore (approximately $916.0 million as of March 31, 2016 ).
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S6	Repatriation could result in an additional income tax payment; however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of Singapore and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our operations in jurisdictions outside of where they are held.
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S7	Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of Singapore and we would meet our liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both.
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S8	Fiscal Year 2016 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion during fiscal year 2016.
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S9	This resulted primarily from $444.1 million of net income for the period plus $625.4 million of non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, other impairment charges, provision for doubtful accounts and stock-based compensation expense that are included in the determination of net income.
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S10	Depreciation expense comprised $425.7 million of those non-cash charges, which was relatively consistent with our normal annual run rate of approximately $425.0 million .
866374_16_ITEM7_P49_S11	We generated $66.9 million in cash as a result of changes in our operating assets and liabilities, driven primarily by a $423.6 million reduction in accounts receivable due to improved collection efforts and lower business levels, offset by a $365.1 million reduction in accounts payable.
866374_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	Net working capital ("NWC"), defined as net accounts receivable, including deferred purchase price receivables, plus inventory less accounts payable decreased by $37.7 million primarily due to lower business levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as compared to the same quarter of fiscal year 2015, which resulted in slightly lower levels of investments in NWC.
866374_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	Cash used in investing activities was $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2016.
866374_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	This resulted primarily from $916.5 million for the acquisition of eleven businesses completed during fiscal year 2016, including approximately $555.2 million , net of cash acquired, related to the acquisition of MCi, $240.8 million , net of cash acquired, related to the acquisition of NEXTracker, and approximately $67.5 million to acquire an optical transport facility from Alcatel-Lucent.
866374_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	We also paid $510.6 million in gross capital expenditures for property and equipment to support certain programs, offset by $13.7 million of proceeds from the sale of certain buildings and machinery and equipment.
866374_16_ITEM7_P50_S4	Other investing activities also includes $44.7 million paid for the purchase of certain investments, offset by $54.3 million of proceeds from the sale of certain assets that were purchased on behalf of a customer and financed by a third party banking institution, as further discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_16_ITEM7_P50_S5	Cash provided by financing activities was $249.6 million during fiscal year 2016, which was primarily the result of net proceeds from bank borrowings and long-term debt of $694.5 million mainly resulting from our new debt issuance discussed further in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, and $61.3 million from the issuance of our shares for option exercises.
866374_16_ITEM7_P50_S6	These cash inflows were partially offset by $420.3 million of cash paid for the repurchase of our ordinary shares, and $75.8 million of cash paid to a third party banking institution for certain assets that were financed by the third party banking institution on behalf of a customer, which is included in other financing activities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P50_S7	Fiscal Year 2015 Cash provided by operating activities was $794.0 million during fiscal year 2015.
866374_16_ITEM7_P50_S8	This resulted primarily from $600.8 million of net income for the period plus $510.9 million of non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, other impairment charges and stock-based compensation expense that are included in the determination of net income.
866374_16_ITEM7_P50_S9	Depreciation expense comprised $496.8 million of those non-cash charges, which was higher than our normal annual run rate of approximately $425.0 million due to accelerated depreciation recognized for fixed assets directly associated with certain product exits during the year.
866374_16_ITEM7_P50_S10	These were offset by $317.6 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities, driven primarily by a $565.1 million reduction in customer deposits that were received in prior periods to support increased working capital requirements in those periods.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as compared to the same quarter of fiscal year 2014, which resulted in lower levels of investments in NWC.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	Cash used in investing activities amounted to $242.2 million during fiscal year 2015.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	This resulted primarily from $347.4 million in gross capital expenditures for property and equipment to support certain programs, offset by $107.7 million of proceeds from the sale of certain buildings and machinery and equipment.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	We also paid $52.7 million for the acquisition of four businesses completed during fiscal year 2015.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S4	Other investing activities also includes $79.7 million of proceeds from the sale of manufacturing equipment originally purchased on behalf of a customer and financed by a third party banking institution, as further discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, partially offset by $15.7 million paid for the purchase of certain technology rights as further discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S5	Cash used in financing activities was $516.0 million during fiscal year 2015, which was primarily the result of cash paid for the repurchase of our ordinary shares in the amount of $415.9 million and net repayment of debt in the amount of $24.6 million.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S6	Included in other financing activities is $88.8 million of cash paid to a third party banking institution for certain manufacturing equipment that was financed by the third party banking institution on behalf of a customer and $11.3 million of cash paid for contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Saturn Electronics and Engineering Inc.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S7	The aforementioned cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of our shares for option exercises amounting to $23.5 million.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S8	Fiscal Year 2014 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion during fiscal year 2014, which resulted primarily from $365.6 million of net income for the period plus $450.0 million of non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation expense that are included in the determination of net income.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S9	We generated $400.9 million in cash as a result of decreases in net operating assets.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S10	NWC increased by $233.7 million primarily to support the increase in our customers' forecasted business levels.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S11	The increases in accounts receivable and inventory are primarily as a result of the increase in sales in our CTG business, which generally carry higher volumes than our other complex segments.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S12	The cash outflows to support NWC were offset by $540.6 million of cash received from certain customers as advances during the period.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S13	In certain instances, the level of inventory reduction or consumption was lower than expected causing an increase to inventory and usage of cash.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S14	In response, we worked with these customers to fund the elevated inventory balances we held on their behalf.
866374_16_ITEM7_P51_S15	We have recorded these advances as other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2014 and expect these amounts to decrease as we produce or sell the associated inventory in the future.
866374_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2014 was $783.9 million.
866374_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	This resulted primarily from $515.0 million in capital expenditures for equipment, net of proceeds on sales.
866374_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Our capital expenditures were related to investments to support innovation, expanding design capabilities, and improving our mechanicals and automation capabilities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	Additionally, we paid $238.0 million for the acquisition of four businesses during the fiscal year, of which the majority relates to the acquisition of certain manufacturing operations from Google's Motorola Mobility LLC for $178.9 million and the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Riwisa AG for a total cash consideration of $44.0 million, net of cash acquired amounting to $9.4 million.
866374_16_ITEM7_P52_S4	Refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".
866374_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $410.8 million during fiscal year 2014, which was primarily attributable to the repurchase of approximately 60.7 million shares for an aggregate purchase value of approximately $475.3 million.
866374_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	Additionally, we entered into a $600.0 million term loan agreement due August 30, 2018 and used all of the proceeds to repay the outstanding balances of our term loan due October 2014 and other term loans in full amounting to $170.3 million and $374.5 million, respectively, and part of the term loan due March 2019.
866374_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Key Liquidity Metrics Free Cash flow We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions, repurchase company shares and for certain other activities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	Our free cash flow, which is calculated as cash provided by operations less net purchases of property and equipment, was $639.5 million , $554.3 million and $701.5 million for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.
866374_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	Free cash flows reconcile to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of cash flows from operations as follows:
866374_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Days in trade accounts receivable was calculated as average accounts receivable for the current and prior quarter, adding back the reduction in accounts receivable resulting from non-cash accounts receivable sales, divided by annualized sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 , days in trade accounts receivable decreased by 1 day to 45 days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to some improvements in collection efforts, and to a lesser extent, due to the decline in net sales.
866374_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	Non-cash accounts receivable sales or deferred purchase price receivables included for the purposes of the calculation were $501.1 million , $600.7 million and $470.9 million for the years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	Deferred purchase price receivables were recorded in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
866374_16_ITEM7_P56_S4	Days in inventory was calculated as average inventory for the current and prior quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_16_ITEM7_P56_S5	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 , days in inventory increased by 1 day to 59 days as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P56_S6	The increase was primarily due to timing of demand from certain customers which was pushed out thus resulting in prepositioned raw materials and higher levels of stalled finished goods.
866374_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Days in accounts payable was calculated as average accounts payable for the current and prior quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 , days in accounts payable remained consistent at 77 days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	Our cash conversion cycle was calculated as days in trade receivables plus days in inventory, minus days in accounts payable and is a measure of how efficient we are at managing our working capital.
866374_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	Our cash conversion cycle remained consistent at 27 days for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to that of fiscal year 2015 due to the factors affecting each of the components in the calculation discussed above.
866374_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets.
866374_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world.
866374_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances; however, any current restrictions are not material.
866374_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout the global organization.
866374_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	We believe that our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months.
866374_16_ITEM7_P59_S4	Future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, the timing of capital expenditures for new equipment, the extent to which we utilize operating leases for new facilities and equipment, and the levels of shipments and changes in the volumes of customer orders.
866374_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Historically, we have funded operations from cash and cash equivalents generated from operations, proceeds from public offerings of equity and debt securities, bank debt and lease financings.
866374_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	We also sell a designated pool of trade receivables under asset-backed securitization ("ABS") programs and sell certain trade receivables, which are in addition to the trade receivables sold in connection with these securitization agreements.
866374_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	billion and $3.4 billion , respectively from other sales of receivables.
866374_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	As of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , the outstanding balance on receivables sold for cash was $1.2 billion , under all our accounts receivable sales programs, which are removed from accounts receivable balances in our consolidated balance sheets.
866374_16_ITEM7_P61_S2	We anticipate that we will enter into debt and equity financings, sales of accounts receivable and lease transactions to fund acquisitions and anticipated growth.
866374_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	The sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current shareholders.
866374_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	Further, we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations and could increase debt service obligations.
866374_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	This increased indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, potentially affect our credit ratings, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_16_ITEM7_P62_S3	Any downgrades in credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow as a result of more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_16_ITEM7_P62_S4	We continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase ordinary shares.
866374_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Historically we have been successful in refinancing and extending the maturity dates on our term loans and credit facilities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	On June 8, 2015, we issued $600 million of 4.750% Notes ("Notes") due June 15, 2025 in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act, at 99.213% of face value, and an effective yield of approximately 4.850% .
866374_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	We received net proceeds of approximately $595.3 million from the issuance which was used for general corporate purposes.
866374_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	During January 2016, we exchanged these notes for new notes with substantially similar terms and completed the registration of these notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
866374_16_ITEM7_P63_S4	Further on March 31, 2014, the maturity date of our former $2.0 billion credit facility ("Credit Facility") which was due to expire in October 2016, was extended to March 2019.
866374_16_ITEM7_P63_S5	We also extended the balance of our term loan associated to the Credit Facility as further described in our Contractual Obligations and Commitments section.
866374_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Under our current share repurchase program, our Board of Directors authorized repurchases of our outstanding ordinary shares for up to $500 million in accordance with the share repurchase mandate approved by our shareholders at the date of the most recent Extraordinary General Meeting which was held on August 20, 2015 .
866374_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	During fiscal year 2016 , we paid $420.3 million to repurchase shares (under the current and prior repurchase plans) at an average price of $11.09 per share.
866374_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	As of March 31, 2016 , shares in the aggregate amount of $242.1 million were available to be repurchased under the current plan.
866374_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS On September 30, 2015, we amended our former $2.0 billion credit facility ("Credit Facility") to increase the $500.0 million term loan maturing in March 2019 by $100.0 million .
866374_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	Quarterly repayments of principal under this term loan were amended to $7.5 million through March 31, 2016 , and will be increased to $11.3 million thereafter with the remainder due upon maturity.
866374_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	As of March 31, 2016, the amended Credit Facility consists of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, for which there were no borrowings outstanding, and a $600.0 million term loan, which is due to expire in March 2019.
866374_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	The credit facility requires that we maintain a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined therein, during its term.
866374_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	As of March 31, 2016 , we were in compliance with these covenants.
866374_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest, at the Company's option, either at (i) LIBOR plus the applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranging between 1.125% and 2.125%, based on the Company's credit ratings or (ii) the base rate (the greatest of the agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin ranging between 0.125% and 1.125%, based on the Company's credit rating.
866374_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging between 0.15% and 0.40% per annum on the daily unused amount of the $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility based on the Company's credit rating.
866374_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	In addition, on June 8, 2015, we issued $600 million of 4.750% Notes (the "4.750% Notes") due June 15, 2025 in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act, at 99.213% , of face value, and an effective yield of approximately 4.850% .

866374_16_ITEM7_P67_S5	These 4.750% Notes are governed by the same terms and covenants as for the $1.0 billion notes, consisting of a $500 million 4.625% note and an additional $500 million 5.000% note (the "Previously Issued Notes"), which are described below.
866374_16_ITEM7_P67_S6	Further, we have a $600 million term loan agreement which matures in August 2018.
866374_16_ITEM7_P67_S7	This loan is repayable in quarterly installments of $3.75 million, which commenced in December 2014 through August 2018, with the remaining amount due at maturity.

866374_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	Further, during fiscal year 2013, we issued an aggregate amount of $1.0 billion in the Previously Issued Notes which are senior unsecured obligations, rank equally with all of our other existing and future senior and unsecured debt obligations, and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally on an unsecured basis, by each of our 100% owned subsidiaries that guarantees indebtedness under, or is a borrower under, our Credit Facility or our $600.0 million term loan facility due August 30, 2018.

866374_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	Additionally, we have leased certain of our property and equipment under capital lease commitments, and certain of our facilities and equipment under operating lease commitments.
866374_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	Future payments due under our purchase obligations, debt including capital leases and related interest obligations and operating lease:
866374_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	We have excluded $212.3 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from the contractual obligations table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the periodic settlements with the respective taxing authorities.
866374_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	See note 13, "Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
866374_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements.
866374_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	We intend to use our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations to fund our existing and future contractual obligations.
866374_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We sell designated pools of trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions under our ABS programs, and in addition to cash, we receive a deferred purchase price receivable for each pool of the receivables sold.
866374_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	Each of these deferred purchase price receivables serves as additional credit support to the financial institutions and is recorded at its estimated fair value.
866374_16_ITEM7_P74_S2	As of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , the fair value of our deferred purchase price receivable was approximately $501.1 million and $600.7 million , respectively.

866374_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio, which consists of highly liquid investments or bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from original dates of purchase and are classified as cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions and highly rated money market accounts.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Our investment policy has strict guidelines focusing on preservation of capital.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The portfolio is comprised of various instruments including term deposits with banks, marketable securities and money market accounts.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our cash is principally invested in the U.S. dollar and China RMB serving as a natural hedge of our RMB denominated costs.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of March 31, 2016 , the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was $1.1 billion , the largest components of which were USD and RMB denominated money market accounts with an average return of 1.22% .
866374_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We had variable rate debt outstanding of approximately $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2016 .
866374_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Variable rate debt obligations consisted of borrowings under our term loans.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Interest on these obligations is discussed above.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our variable rate debt instruments create exposures for us related to interest rate risk.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Primarily due to the current low interest rates a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As of March 31, 2016 , the approximate average fair value of our debt outstanding under our term loan facilities that matures in March 2019 and August 2018, and Notes due February 2020, February 2023 and June 2025 was 101.0% of the face value of the debt obligations based on broker trading prices.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	We have established a foreign currency risk management policy to manage this risk.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P6_S2	To the extent possible, we manage our foreign currency exposure by evaluating and using non-financial techniques, such as currency of invoice, leading and lagging payments and receivables management.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P6_S3	In addition, we may borrow in various foreign currencies and enter into short-term foreign currency forward, swap, and option contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities, mainly accounts receivable and accounts payable, and cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P6_S4	We endeavor to maintain a partial or fully hedged position for certain transaction exposures.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P6_S5	These exposures are primarily, but not limited to, revenues, customer and vendor payments and inter-company balances in currencies other than the functional currency unit of the operating entity.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P6_S6	The credit risk of our foreign currency forward and swap contracts is minimized since all contracts are with large financial institutions and accordingly, fair value adjustments related to the credit risk of the counter-party financial institution were not material.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The gains and losses on forward and swap contracts generally offset the losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and transactions hedged.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The fair value of currency forward and swap contracts is reported on the balance sheet.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	amounted to $4.3 billion and the recorded fair values of the associated assets and liabilities were not material.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The majority of these foreign exchange contracts expire in less than three months and all expire within one year.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	They will settle primarily in Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, China renminbi, Danish krone, the Euro, Hungarian forint, Israeli shekel, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.
866374_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Based on our overall currency rate exposures as of March 31, 2016 , including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and cash flows, a near-term 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar from its cross-functional rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.

866374_16_ITEM8_P60_S4	Fair values of these investments, when required, are estimated using unobservable inputs, primarily comparable company multiples and discounted cash flow projections.
866374_16_ITEM8_P60_S5	As of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Company's equity investments in non-majority owned companies totaled $122.9 million and $87.0 million , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P60_S6	The equity in the earnings or losses of the Company's equity method investments was not material to the consolidated results of operations for any period presented and is included in interest and other, net.
866374_16_ITEM8_P60_S7	Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities include customer working capital advances of $253.7 million and $189.6 million , customer-related accruals of $479.5 million and $454.8 million , and deferred revenue of $332.3 million and $272.6 million as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P60_S8	The customer working capital advances are not interest bearing, do not have fixed repayment dates and are generally reduced as the underlying working capital is consumed in production.
866374_16_ITEM8_P60_S9	Other current liabilities also included the outstanding balances due to the third party banking institution related to the financed equipment discussed above of $122.0 million and $197.7 million as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, as further described in note 17.
866374_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company recognizes restructuring charges related to its plans to close or consolidate excess manufacturing and administrative facilities.
866374_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	In connection with these activities, the Company records restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other exit-related costs.
866374_16_ITEM8_P61_S2	The recognition of restructuring charges requires the Company to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_16_ITEM8_P61_S3	To the extent the Company's actual results differ from its estimates and assumptions, the Company may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_16_ITEM8_P61_S4	Such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_16_ITEM8_P61_S5	At the end of each reporting period, the Company evaluates the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_16_ITEM8_P61_S6	See note 14 for additional information regarding restructuring charges.
866374_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance which eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment.
866374_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Company has elected to early adopt this new guidance during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 on a prospective basis as permitted under the new guidance, and the impact was not material.
866374_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued new guidance to eliminate the requirement for companies to separate deferred income tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts on the balance sheet.
866374_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	Instead, companies will be required to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent.
866374_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
866374_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.
866374_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	In September 2015, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination.
866374_16_ITEM8_P65_S2	Under previous guidance, the acquirer retrospectively adjusted the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, and would have to revise comparative information for prior periods presented in financial statements as needed.
866374_16_ITEM8_P65_S3	The update requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.
866374_16_ITEM8_P65_S4	The Company has elected to early adopt this new guidance which is effective for the Company beginning the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, and the impact was not material.
866374_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements.
866374_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	Under the new guidance, an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset, with amortization of the costs being reported as interest expense.
866374_16_ITEM8_P66_S2	The Company has elected to early adopt during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, and retrospectively adjusted all prior balance sheets presented.
866374_16_ITEM8_P66_S3	As a result of the adoption, $12.7 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Company s bank borrowings and long-term debt as of March 31, 2015, were reclassified from other noncurrent assets, to short-term and long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet.
866374_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the accounting for share-based payments.
866374_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	The new guidance simplifies various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments including income tax effects, withholding requirements and forfeitures.
866374_16_ITEM8_P67_S2	The Company will be required to adopt the new guidance beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted.
866374_16_ITEM8_P67_S3	The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update and the timing of adoption.
866374_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance intended to improve financial reporting on leasing transactions.
866374_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	The new lease guidance will require entities that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.
866374_16_ITEM8_P68_S2	The guidance will also enhance existing disclosure requirements relating to those leases.
866374_16_ITEM8_P68_S3	The Company will be required to adopt the new lease guidance beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.
866374_16_ITEM8_P68_S4	Upon initial evaluation, the Company believes the new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheets when adopted.
866374_16_ITEM8_P68_S5	The Company is currently assessing the timing of adoption.
866374_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the measurement of inventory, by requiring that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
866374_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market.
866374_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
866374_16_ITEM8_P69_S3	The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update and the timing of adoption.
866374_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance which requires an entity to recognize revenue relating to contracts with customers that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
866374_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	In order to meet this requirement, the entity must apply the following steps: (i) identify the contracts with the customers; (ii) identify performance obligations in the contracts; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations per the contracts; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
866374_16_ITEM8_P70_S2	Additionally, disclosures required for revenue recognition will include qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
866374_16_ITEM8_P70_S3	In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the standard by a year, and as a result, the guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
866374_16_ITEM8_P70_S4	The Company has assessed that the impact of the new guidance will result in a change of the Company's revenue recognition model from "point in time" upon physical delivery to an "over time" model and believes this transition will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
866374_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Equity Compensation Plans The Company's primary plan used for granting equity compensation awards is the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan").
866374_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	During fiscal year 2016, in conjunction with the acquisition of NEXTracker, the Company assumed all of the outstanding, unvested share bonus awards and outstanding, unvested options to purchase shares of common stock of NEXTracker, and converted all these shares into Flex awards.
866374_16_ITEM8_P71_S2	As a result, the Company offers an additional equity compensation plan as of March 31, 2016 , the 2014 NEXTracker Equity Incentive Plan (the "NEXTracker Plan").
866374_16_ITEM8_P71_S3	Further, during fiscal year 2016, the Company granted equity compensation awards under a third plan, the 2013 Elementum Plan (the "Elementum Plan"), which is administered by Elementum SCM (Cayman) Limited ("Elementum"), a majority owned subsidiary of the Company.
866374_16_ITEM8_P71_S4	The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense for all Equity Incentive Plans:
866374_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	As required by the authoritative guidance for stock-based compensation, management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.
866374_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary termination behavior as well as an analysis of actual forfeitures.
866374_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	Cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits (tax benefits related to the excess of proceeds from employee exercises of share options over the share-based compensation cost recognized for those options) are classified as financing cash flows.
866374_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	During fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company did not recognize any excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow.
866374_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	The 2010 Equity Incentive Plan As of March 31, 2016 , the Company had approximately 27.1 million shares available for grant under the 2010 Plan.
866374_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	Options issued to employees under the 2010 Plan generally vest over four years and expire seven years from the date of grant.
866374_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	Options granted to non-employee directors expire five years from the date of grant.
866374_16_ITEM8_P75_S3	The exercise price of options granted to employees is determined by the Company's Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and may not be less than the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant.
866374_16_ITEM8_P75_S4	As of March 31, 2016 , the total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested share options granted to employees under the 2010 Plan was not significant and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.3 years, adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_16_ITEM8_P75_S5	The Company also grants share bonus awards under its equity compensation plan.
866374_16_ITEM8_P75_S6	Share bonus awards are rights to acquire a specified number of ordinary shares for no cash consideration in exchange for continued service with the Company.
866374_16_ITEM8_P75_S7	Share bonus awards generally vest in installments over a three to five -year period and unvested share bonus awards are forfeited upon termination of employment.
866374_16_ITEM8_P75_S8	Vesting for certain share bonus awards is contingent upon both service and market conditions.
866374_16_ITEM8_P75_S9	Further, vesting for certain share bonus awards granted to certain executive officers is contingent upon meeting certain free cash flow targets.
866374_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3.
866374_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	As of March 31, 2016 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share bonus awards granted to employees was approximately $97.9 million , net of estimated forfeitures, under the 2010 Plan.
866374_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	These costs will be amortized generally on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years, adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_16_ITEM8_P77_S2	Approximately $13.7 million of the unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2010 Plan, net of estimated forfeitures, is related to share bonus awards granted to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting a certain market condition.
866374_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	Determining Fair Value - Options and share bonus awards Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share options granted under the 2010 Plan using the Black-Scholes valuation method and a single option award approach.
866374_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
866374_16_ITEM8_P78_S2	The fair market value of share bonus awards granted, other than those awards with a market condition, is the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant and is generally recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.
866374_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	Expected Term The Company's expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation method represents the period that the Company's share options are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share options, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its share options.
866374_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	Expected Volatility The Company's expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes valuation method is derived from a combination of implied volatility related to publicly traded options to purchase Flex ordinary shares and historical variability in the Company's periodic share price.
866374_16_ITEM8_P79_S2	Expected Dividend The Company has never paid dividends on its ordinary shares and accordingly the dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.
866374_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities issued with a term equivalent to the expected term of the option.
866374_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	There were no options granted under the 2010 Plan during fiscal years 2016 and 2014.
866374_16_ITEM8_P80_S2	The fair value of the Company's share options granted to employees for fiscal year 2015 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	Options granted during fiscal year 2015 had contractual lives of seven years.
866374_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	Determining Fair Value - Share bonus awards with service and market conditions Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share bonus awards granted under the 2010 Plan whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions using Monte Carlo simulation.
866374_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is the service period.
866374_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	Expected volatility of Flex Volatility used in a Monte Carlo simulation is derived from the historical volatility of Flex's stock price over a period equal to the service period of the share bonus awards granted.
866374_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	The service period is three years for those share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
866374_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3.
866374_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	Average peer volatility Volatility used in a Monte Carlo simulation is derived from the historical volatilities of both the S P 500 index and components of an extended Electronics Manufacturing Services ("EMS") group, comprised of global competitors of the Company within the same industry, for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
866374_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	Average Peer Correlation Correlation coefficients were used to model the movement of Flex's stock price relative to both the S P 500 index and peers in the extended EMS group for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
866374_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Expected Dividend and Risk-Free Interest Rate assumptions Same methodology as discussed above.
866374_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	The fair value of the Company's share-bonus awards under the 2010 Plan, whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions, for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	The following is a summary of option activity for the Company's 2010 Plan ("Price" reflects the weighted-average exercise price):
866374_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the Company's 2010 Plan (calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying award and the price of the Company's ordinary shares determined as of the time of option exercise for options exercised in-the-money) was $55.3 million , $16.3 million and $24.7 million during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	Cash received from option exercises under the 2010 Plan was $61.1 million , $23.5 million and $28.1 million for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3.
866374_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	The following table presents the composition of options outstanding and exercisable under the 2010 Plan as of March 31, 2016 :
866374_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	As of March 31, 2016 the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding, options vested and expected to vest (which includes adjustments for expected forfeitures), and options exercisable under the Company's 2010 Plan, were $9.4 million , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company's ordinary shares as of March 31, 2016 for the approximately 2.1 million options that were in-the-money at March 31, 2016 .
866374_16_ITEM8_P91_S2	The following table summarizes the Company's share bonus award activity under the 2010 Plan ("Price" reflects the weighted-average grant-date fair value):
866374_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	Of the 7.6 million unvested share bonus awards granted under the 2010 Plan in fiscal year 2016 , approximately 0.2 million have an average grant date price of $12.10 per share and represents the target amount of grants made to certain executive officers whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain free cash flow targets.
866374_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	These awards ultimately vest over a range from zero up to a maximum of 0.4 million of the target payment based on a measurement of cumulative three -year increase of free cash flow from operations of the Company, and will cliff vest after a period of three -years.
866374_16_ITEM8_P92_S2	Another 0.2 million of unvested share bonus awards granted in fiscal year 2016 have an average grant date price of $12.06 per share and represents the target amount of grants made to certain employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain operating profit targets.
866374_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3.
866374_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	The vesting will begin on March 31, 2016 and occur every year over a period of four years contingent on meeting the agreed targets.
866374_16_ITEM8_P94_S1	Further, 0.7 million of unvested share bonus awards granted in fiscal year 2016 represents the target amount of grants made to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on certain market conditions.
866374_16_ITEM8_P94_S2	The average grant date fair value of these awards was estimated to be $14.96 per award and was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation.
866374_16_ITEM8_P94_S3	Vesting information of these shares are further detailed in the table below.
866374_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	Of the 17.0 million unvested share bonus awards outstanding under the 2010 Plan as of the fiscal year ended 2016 , approximately 3.2 million of unvested share bonus awards under the 2010 Plan represents the target amount of grants made to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions summarized as follows:
866374_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	In accordance with the accounting guidance, the Company will continue to recognize share-based compensation expense for these awards with market conditions regardless of whether such awards will ultimately vest.
866374_16_ITEM8_P96_S1	During fiscal year 2016 , 2.2 million shares vested in connection with the remaining number of share bonus awards with market conditions granted in fiscal year 2013, and 0.5 million shares vested in connection with half of the share bonus awards with market conditions granted in fiscal year 2012.
866374_16_ITEM8_P96_S2	The total intrinsic value of share bonus awards vested under the Company's 2010 Plan was $103.2 million , $79.0 million and $42.4 million during fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, based on the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date vested.
866374_16_ITEM8_P96_S3	The 2014 NEXTracker Equity Incentive Plan All shares granted during fiscal year 2016 under the NEXTracker plan are the result of the Company's conversion of all outstanding, unvested shares of NEXTracker into unvested shares of the Company, as part of the acquisition.
866374_16_ITEM8_P96_S4	No additional grants will be made out of this plan in the future and therefore there are no shares available for grant under the NEXTracker Plan as of March 31, 2016 .
866374_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	Options issued to employees under the NEXTracker Plan generally have a vesting period of two to four years from vesting commencement date and expire ten years from the date of grant.
866374_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3.
866374_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	The exercise price of options granted to employees was determined by the Company based on a conversion rate agreed upon in the purchase agreement of NEXTracker.
866374_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	As of March 31, 2016 , the total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested share options granted to employees under the NEXTracker Plan was $18.2 million and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.8 years, adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_16_ITEM8_P99_S2	The Company also granted share bonus awards under the NEXTracker Plan.
866374_16_ITEM8_P99_S3	These share bonus awards vest in installments over a three to five -year period from vesting commencement date, and unvested share bonus awards are forfeited upon termination of employment.
866374_16_ITEM8_P99_S4	Vesting for certain of these share bonus awards is contingent on meeting certain performance targets over a three -year period commencing October 1, 2015.
866374_16_ITEM8_P99_S5	As of March 31, 2016 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share bonus awards granted to employees was approximately $19.1 million under the NEXTracker Plan.
866374_16_ITEM8_P99_S6	These costs will be amortized generally on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.4 years, adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
866374_16_ITEM8_P99_S7	The fair value of the Company's share options granted to employees under the NEXTracker Plan for fiscal year 2016 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:

866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S2	The investment limits set by the financial institutions are $700.0 million for the Global Program, of which $600.0 million is committed and $100.0 million is uncommitted, and $265.0 million for the North American Program, of which $225.0 million is committed and $40.0 million is uncommitted.
866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S3	Both programs require a minimum level of deferred purchase price receivable to be retained by the Company in connection with the sales.
866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S4	The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the special purpose entities and receives a servicing fee of 0.1% to 0.5% of serviced receivables per annum.
866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S5	Servicing fees recognized during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were not material and are included in interest and other, net within the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S6	As the Company estimates the fee it receives in return for its obligation to service these receivables is at fair value, no servicing assets or liabilities are recognized.
866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S7	As of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , the accounts receivable balances that were sold under the ABS Programs were removed from the consolidated balance sheets and the net cash proceeds received by the Company during fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were included as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S8	As of March 31, 2016 , approximately $1.4 billion of accounts receivable had been sold to the special purpose entities under the ABS Programs for which the Company had received net cash proceeds of $880.8 million and deferred purchase price receivables of $501.1 million .

866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S10	The portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid by the unaffiliated financial institutions in cash is a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid to the special purpose entity as payments on the receivables are collected from account debtors.
866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S11	The deferred purchase price receivable represents a beneficial interest in the transferred financial assets and is recognized at fair value as part of the sale transaction.
866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S12	The deferred purchase price receivables are included in other current assets as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , and were carried at the expected recovery amount of the related receivables.
866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S13	The difference between the carrying amount of the receivables sold under these programs and the sum of the cash and fair value of the deferred purchase price receivables received at time of transfer is recognized as a loss on sale of the related receivables and recorded in interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations; such amounts were $9.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 , and $7.1 million for both fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 .
866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S14	For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , cash flows from sales of receivables under the ABS Programs consisted of approximately $5.2 billion , $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion , respectively, for transfers of receivables (of which approximately $0.4 billion , $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion , respectively, represented new transfers and the remainder proceeds from collections reinvested in revolving period transfers).
866374_16_ITEM8_P139_S15	The following table summarizes the activity in the deferred purchase price receivables account during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 :

866374_16_ITEM8_P142_S1	The receivables that were sold were removed from the consolidated balance sheets and were reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
866374_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
866374_16_ITEM8_P143_S1	When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact, and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
866374_16_ITEM8_P144_S0	The accounting guidance for fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.
866374_16_ITEM8_P144_S1	A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
866374_16_ITEM8_P144_S2	The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
866374_16_ITEM8_P145_S0	Level 1 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
866374_16_ITEM8_P146_S0	The Company has deferred compensation plans for its officers and certain other employees.
866374_16_ITEM8_P146_S1	Amounts deferred under the plans are invested in hypothetical investments selected by the participant or the participant's investment manager.
866374_16_ITEM8_P146_S2	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets are included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets and include investments in equity securities that are valued using active market prices.
866374_16_ITEM8_P147_S0	Level 2 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets) such as cash and cash equivalents and money market funds; or model- derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
866374_16_ITEM8_P148_S0	The Company values foreign exchange forward contracts using level 2 observable inputs which primarily consist of an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
866374_16_ITEM8_P148_S1	The Company's cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits and money market funds, which are valued using level 2 inputs, such as interest rates and maturity periods.
866374_16_ITEM8_P148_S2	Due to their short-term nature, their carrying amount approximates fair value.
866374_16_ITEM8_P148_S3	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets also include money market funds, mutual funds, corporate and government bonds and certain convertible securities that are valued using prices obtained from various pricing sources.
866374_16_ITEM8_P148_S4	These sources price these investments using certain market indices and the performance of these investments in relation to these indices.
866374_16_ITEM8_P148_S5	As a result, the Company has classified these investments as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
866374_16_ITEM8_P149_S0	Level 3 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
866374_16_ITEM8_P149_S1	The Company has accrued for contingent consideration in connection with its business acquisitions as applicable, which is measured at fair value based on certain internal models and unobservable inputs.
866374_16_ITEM8_P149_S2	The Company accrued $84.3 million of contingent consideration, of which $81.0 million related to the acquisition of NEXTracker on the date of acquisition.
866374_16_ITEM8_P149_S3	Additionally, an incremental fair value adjustment of $3.7 million also related to NEXTracker, was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during fiscal year 2016.
866374_16_ITEM8_P149_S4	The Company reduced the accrual by $19.0 million for a contractual release from the obligation executed subsequent to the acquisition.
866374_16_ITEM8_P149_S5	The fair value of the liability was estimated using a simulation-based measurement technique with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a level 3 fair value measurement.
866374_16_ITEM8_P149_S6	The significant inputs in the fair value measurement not supported by market activity included the Company's probability assessments of expected future revenue during the earn-out period and associated volatility, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligation, and calculated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
866374_16_ITEM8_P149_S7	Significant decreases in expected revenue during the earn-out period, or significant increases in the discount rate or volatility in isolation would result in lower fair value estimates.
866374_16_ITEM8_P149_S8	The interrelationship between these inputs is not considered significant.
866374_16_ITEM8_P150_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 11.
866374_16_ITEM8_P151_S0	During fiscal year 2015, the Company paid $11.3 million of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Saturn Electronics and Engineering Inc.
866374_16_ITEM8_P151_S1	The following table summarizes the activities related to contingent consideration:
866374_16_ITEM8_P152_S0	The Company values deferred purchase price receivables relating to its Asset-Backed Securitization Program based on a discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable inputs (i.e. level 3 inputs), which are primarily risk free interest rates adjusted for the credit quality of the underlying creditor.
866374_16_ITEM8_P152_S1	Due to its high credit quality and short term maturity, their fair value approximates carrying value.
866374_16_ITEM8_P152_S2	Significant increases in either of the significant unobservable inputs (credit spread or risk free interest rate) in isolation would result in lower fair value estimates, however the impact is insignificant.
866374_16_ITEM8_P152_S3	The interrelationship between these inputs is also insignificant.
866374_16_ITEM8_P152_S4	Refer to note 10 for a reconciliation of the change in the deferred purchase price receivable.
866374_16_ITEM8_P153_S0	There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 .

866374_16_ITEM8_P155_S0	Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company has certain long-lived assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, and are as follows:
866374_16_ITEM8_P156_S0	Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are recorded at the lesser of the carrying value or fair value, which is based on comparable sales from prevailing market data (level 2 inputs).
866374_16_ITEM8_P156_S1	During fiscal year 2016 , the Company transferred $5.6 million of assets to assets held for sale, relating to a building and land which has been identified to be sold.
866374_16_ITEM8_P156_S2	Disposals of assets held for sale totaled $0.3 million and $41.5 million during fiscal year 2016 and 2015 , respectively, which resulted in an immaterial loss in fiscal year 2016, and a gain of $12.1 million in fiscal year 2015 that was included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations.
866374_16_ITEM8_P156_S3	No impairment charges were recorded for assets held for sale during fiscal years 2016 and 2015.
866374_16_ITEM8_P156_S4	Assets held for sale as of the fiscal years 2016 and 2015 were not significant.
866374_16_ITEM8_P156_S5	There were no material fair value adjustments or other transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy for these long-lived assets during the fiscal years 2016 and 2015 .

866374_16_ITEM8_P159_S0	The term loans and Notes due February 2020, February 2023 and June 2025 are valued based on broker trading prices in active markets.
866374_16_ITEM8_P159_S1	The Company values its 50 million (approximately $56.6 million as of March 31, 2016 ), 5 -year, unsecured, term-loan due September 30, 2020 based on the current market rate, and as of March 31, 2016 , the carrying amount approximates fair value.
866374_16_ITEM8_P160_S0	COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments Capital lease obligations of $25.0 million and $5.3 million , consisting of short-term obligations of $6.6 million and $2.8 million and long term obligations of $18.4 million and $2.5 million are included in current and non-current liabilities on the Company's balance sheets as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P161_S0	As of March 31, 2016 and 2015 , the gross carrying amount and associated accumulated depreciation of the Company's property and equipment financed under capital leases, and the related obligations was not material.
866374_16_ITEM8_P161_S1	The Company also leases certain of its facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.
866374_16_ITEM8_P161_S2	These operating leases expire in various years through 2035 and require the following minimum lease payments:
866374_16_ITEM8_P162_S0	Total rent expense amounted to $124.2 million , $133.1 million and $150.1 million in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P163_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 12.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S0	Litigation and other legal matters During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, one of the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries received an assessment for certain sales and import taxes.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S1	The tax assessment notice is for nine months of calendar year 2010 for an alleged amount of 50 million Brazilian reals (approximately $13.8 million based on the exchange rate as of March 31, 2016 ) plus interest.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S2	This assessment is in the second stage of the review process at the administrative level, and the Company plans to continue to vigorously oppose it as well as any future assessments.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S3	The Company is, however, unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of these assessments against our Brazilian subsidiary.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S4	While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liabilities, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the administrative-review and judicial processes in Brazil and the nature of the claims, it is unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss for this assessment or any future assessments that are reasonably possible.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S5	The Company does not expect final judicial determination on these claims for several years.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S6	During fiscal year 2015, one of the Company's non-operating Brazilian subsidiaries received an assessment of approximately $100 million related to income and social contribution taxes, interest and penalties.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S7	The Company believes there is no legal basis for the assessment and expects that any losses are remote.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S8	The Company plans to vigorously defend itself through the administrative and judicial processes.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S9	In addition, from time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S10	The Company defends itself vigorously against any such claims.
866374_16_ITEM8_P164_S11	Although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management expects that any losses that are probable or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of these matters, which are in excess of amounts already accrued in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, would not be material to the financial statements as a whole.
866374_16_ITEM8_P165_S0	The domestic (Singapore) and foreign components of income before income taxes were comprised of the following:
866374_16_ITEM8_P166_S0	The provision for income taxes consisted of the following:
866374_16_ITEM8_P167_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13.
866374_16_ITEM8_P168_S0	The domestic statutory income tax rate was approximately 17.0% in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
866374_16_ITEM8_P168_S1	The reconciliation of the income tax expense expected based on domestic statutory income tax rates to the expense for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows:
866374_16_ITEM8_P169_S0	A number of countries in which the Company is located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business.
866374_16_ITEM8_P169_S1	In general, these holidays were secured based on the nature, size and location of the Company s operations.
866374_16_ITEM8_P169_S2	The aggregate dollar effect on the Company s income resulting from tax holidays and tax incentives to attract and retain business for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $6.6 million , $9.8 million and $15.2 million , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P169_S3	For fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 , the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share was $0.01 and $0.01 , respectively, and the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share during fiscal years 2015 and 2014 , were $0.02 and $0.02 and $0.02 and $0.02 , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P169_S4	Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, the Company's existing holidays will expire in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 through fiscal year 2022 .
866374_16_ITEM8_P170_S0	For fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company released valuation allowances totaling $63.3 million , $55.0 million and $37.4 million , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P170_S1	These valuation allowance releases were primarily related to our operations that were deemed to be more likely than not to realize the respective deferred tax assets due to the increased profitability during the prior three fiscal years as well as continued forecasted profitability of that subsidiary.
866374_16_ITEM8_P170_S2	During fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, $43.0 million of the valuation allowance release was related to the recording of deferred tax liabilities in the US related to intangibles acquired during fiscal year 2016.
866374_16_ITEM8_P170_S3	However, these valuation allowance eliminations were offset by other current period valuation allowance movements primarily related to current period valuation allowance additions due to increased deferred tax assets related to current period losses in legal entities with existing full valuation allowance positions, and to a lesser extent, current period changes in valuation allowance positions due to increased negative evidence during the period in legal entities which did not previously have valuation allowance recorded.
866374_16_ITEM8_P171_S0	For fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the offsetting amounts totaled $64.3 million , $57.5 million and $64.2 million , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P172_S0	Under its territorial tax system, Singapore generally does not tax foreign sourced income until repatriated to Singapore.
866374_16_ITEM8_P172_S1	The Company has included the effects of Singapore's territorial tax system in the rate differential line above.
866374_16_ITEM8_P172_S2	The tax effect of foreign income not repatriated to Singapore for the fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were $36.6 million , $0.0 million and $51.5 million , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P173_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13.
866374_16_ITEM8_P174_S0	The components of deferred income taxes are as follows:
866374_16_ITEM8_P175_S0	Utilization of the Company's deferred tax assets is limited by the future earnings of the Company in the tax jurisdictions in which such deferred assets arose.
866374_16_ITEM8_P175_S1	As a result, management is uncertain as to when or whether these operations will generate sufficient profit to realize any benefit from the deferred tax assets.
866374_16_ITEM8_P176_S0	The valuation allowance provides a reserve against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized by the Company.
866374_16_ITEM8_P176_S1	However, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize certain of these benefits and, accordingly, has recognized a deferred tax asset from these benefits.
866374_16_ITEM8_P176_S2	The change in valuation allowance is net of certain increases and decreases to prior year losses and other carryforwards that have no current impact on the tax provision.
866374_16_ITEM8_P176_S3	Approximately $34.0 million of the valuation allowance relates to income tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options, which if realized will be credited directly to shareholders equity and will not be available to benefit the income tax provision in any future period.
866374_16_ITEM8_P177_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13.
866374_16_ITEM8_P178_S0	The Company has recorded deferred tax assets of approximately $2.4 billion related to tax losses and other carryforwards against which the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for all but $79.3 million of the deferred tax assets.
866374_16_ITEM8_P178_S1	These tax losses and other carryforwards will expire at various dates as follows:
866374_16_ITEM8_P179_S0	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced or increased in the near-term if facts, including the amount of taxable income or the mix of taxable income between subsidiaries, differ from management s estimates.
866374_16_ITEM8_P179_S1	The Company does not provide for income taxes on approximately $916.0 million of undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of Singapore as management has plans for the use of such earnings to fund certain activities outside of Singapore.
866374_16_ITEM8_P179_S2	Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
866374_16_ITEM8_P179_S3	During the fiscal year 2015, we changed our intent with regard to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings from certain of our Chinese subsidiaries which are scheduled to be de-registrated or liquidated in the near future.
866374_16_ITEM8_P179_S4	As a result, as of March 31, 2016, we have provided for applicable foreign withholding taxes on $106.7 million of undistributed foreign earnings, and recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $11.2 million .
866374_16_ITEM8_P179_S5	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
866374_16_ITEM8_P180_S0	The Company s unrecognized tax benefits are subject to change over the next twelve months primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and as audits are settled.
866374_16_ITEM8_P180_S1	The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by an estimated range of an additional $13.0 million to $41.0 million within the next twelve months primarily due to potential settlements of various audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.
866374_16_ITEM8_P181_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file federal, state, and local income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions around world.
866374_16_ITEM8_P181_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2006.
866374_16_ITEM8_P181_S2	Of the $212.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2016 , $185.7 million will affect the annual effective tax rate ("ETR") if the benefits are eventually recognized.
866374_16_ITEM8_P181_S3	The amount that doesn t impact the ETR relates to positions that would be settled with a tax loss carryforward previously subject to a valuation allowance.
866374_16_ITEM8_P182_S0	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13.
866374_16_ITEM8_P183_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within the Company's tax expense.
866374_16_ITEM8_P183_S1	During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately ($2.4) million and $2.5 million and $8.4 million , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P183_S2	The Company had approximately $14.6 million , $17.0 million and $15.6 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
866374_16_ITEM8_P184_S0	The Company initiated certain restructuring activities during fiscal year 2014 intended to improve its operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce and capacity and realign the corporate cost structure.

866374_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2016 .
866374_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2016 , such disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	(b) Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	As of March 31, 2016 , under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation was conducted of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").
866374_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2016 .
866374_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements or prevent or detect instances of fraud.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management's annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016 excluded the internal control over financial reporting of eight of our acquisitions that were completed during the year ended March 31, 2016 , which constitute, in the aggregate, 5 % of total assets and 3% of net sales of the consolidated financial statements amount as of, and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 .
866374_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended March 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Flextronics International Ltd.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Singapore We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Flextronics International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	As described in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of eight acquisitions that were completed during the year ended March 31, 2016, which constitute, in aggregate, 5% of total assets and 3% of net sales of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting of eight acquisitions.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P5_S3	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P5_S5	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
866374_16_ITEM9A_P5_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P5_S7	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P5_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P6_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
866374_16_ITEM9A_P6_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2016, of the Company and our report dated May 20, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

866374_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Our expertise is Sketch-to-Scale tm services: design, manufacture, and supply services for a broad range of products, from electronics to athletic shoes.
866374_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Although Flex has evolved beyond traditional EMS, the majority of our customers are electronics original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"); as such, the closest broad definition of our industry remains the outsourced EMS industry.
866374_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	EMS has experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elect to outsource some or all of their design, manufacturing, and after-market services requirements.
866374_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	In recent years, we have seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, primarily in the technology sector.
866374_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	Companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, internet service providers, or e-commerce retailers are entering the highly competitive and rapidly evolving hardware markets, with products including mobile devices, home entertainment and wearable devices.
866374_17_ITEM1_P5_S3	This trend has resulted in significant changes to the hardware manufacturing and supply chain solutions requirements of such companies.
866374_17_ITEM1_P5_S4	Increasingly complex products require highly customized supply chain solutions, in turn resulting in significant changes to the overall manufacturing and supply chain landscape.
866374_17_ITEM1_P5_S5	The growth of the overall industry for calendar year 2016 is estimated to have been around 4% .
866374_17_ITEM1_P5_S6	We believe the total available market for the EMS industry is poised for continued growth, with current penetration rates estimated to be about 30% .
866374_17_ITEM1_P5_S7	The intensely competitive nature of the electronics industry, the increasing complexity and sophistication of electronics products, and pressure on OEMs to reduce product costs and shorten product life cycles are all factors that encourage OEMs to utilize supply chain service providers as part of their business and manufacturing strategies.
866374_17_ITEM1_P5_S8	Utilizing global manufacturing and service providers allows OEMs to take advantage of the global design, manufacturing and supply chain management expertise of such providers, and enables OEMs to concentrate on product research, development, marketing, and sales.
866374_17_ITEM1_P5_S9	We believe that OEMs realize a number of important benefits through their strategic relationships with EMS providers, including:
866374_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Ability to focus on core branding and R D initiatives.
866374_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	We believe that growth in the EMS industry will be largely driven by the need for OEMs to respond to rapidly changing markets and technologies, the increasing complexity of supply chains and the continued pressure to be cost competitive.
866374_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Additionally, we believe that there are significant opportunities for global EMS providers to win additional business from OEMs in markets or industry segments that have yet to substantially utilize such providers.
866374_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	SERVICE OFFERINGS We offer a broad range of customizable services to our customers.

866374_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Rigid and Flexible Printed Circuit Board ("PCB") Fabrication.
866374_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Printed circuit boards are composed of laminated materials that provide the interconnection for integrated circuits, passive and other electronic components and thus are at the heart of almost every electrical system.
866374_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	They are formed out of multi-layered epoxy resin and glass cloth systems with very fine traces, spaces, and plated holes (called vias) which interconnect the different layers into an extremely dense circuit network that carries the electrical signals between components.
866374_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	As semiconductor designs become more complex and signal speeds increase, there is an increasing demand for higher density integration on printed circuit boards, requiring higher layer counts, finer lines and spacings, smaller vias (microvias) and base materials with very low electrical loss characteristics.
866374_17_ITEM1_P36_S3	The manufacturing of these complex multilayer interconnect products often requires the use of sophisticated circuit interconnections between layers, and adherence to strict electrical characteristics to maintain consistent transmission speeds and impedances.
866374_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	devices and the complexity of wireless products are driving the demand for more flexible printed circuits.
866374_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Flexible circuit boards facilitate a reduction in the weight of a finished electronic product and allow the designer to use the third dimension in designing new products or product features.
866374_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	Flexible circuits have become a very attractive design alternative for many new and emerging application spaces such as automotive rear light-emitting diode ("LED") lighting, tablet computers, and miniaturized radio frequency identification tags or smart cards.

866374_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	We have developed rigorous compliance programs designed to meet the needs and specifications of our customers as well as the regulations.
866374_17_ITEM1_P60_S2	These programs vary from collecting compliance or material data from our Flex controlled or managed suppliers to full laboratory testing, and we include compliance requirements in our standard supplier contracts.
866374_17_ITEM1_P60_S3	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	In the case of WEEE, although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations.

866374_17_ITEM1_P63_S3	As of March 31, 2017 and 2016 , the carrying value of our intellectual property was not material.
866374_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	Although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it, from time to time third parties do assert patent infringement claims against us or our customers.
866374_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	In addition, we provide design and engineering services to our customers and also design and make our own products.
866374_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	As a consequence of these activities, our customers are requiring us to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses.
866374_17_ITEM1_P64_S3	If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_17_ITEM1_P64_S4	Such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor.
866374_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	We also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services.
866374_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS Refer to note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for financial information about our business segments and geographic areas.
866374_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Our Internet address is https://www.flex.com.
866374_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	We make available through our Internet website the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
866374_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	We were incorporated in the Republic of Singapore in May 1990.
866374_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	Our principal corporate office is located at 2 Changi South Lane, Singapore 486123.
866374_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	Our U.S. corporate headquarters is located at 6201 America Center Drive, San Jose, CA 95002.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We derive our revenues from customers in the following business groups:
866374_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	HRS, which is comprised of our medical business, including consumer health, digital health, disposables, precision plastics, drug delivery, diagnostics, life sciences and imaging equipment; our automotive business, including vehicle electrification, connectivity, autonomous vehicles, and clean technologies; and our defense and aerospace businesses, focused on commercial aviation, defense and military.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Factors affecting any of these industries in general or our customers in particular, could adversely impact us.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	there may be recessionary periods in our customers' markets.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and our current and potential customers may decide to manufacture some or all of their products internally, which could harm our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Cancellations, reductions, or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers have harmed, and may in the future harm, our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and deliver for these customers, by causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders, and by lowering our asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Additionally, current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our capabilities against other providers as well as against the merits of manufacturing products themselves.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our business would be adversely affected if customers decide to perform these functions internally or transfer their business to another provider.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In addition, we face competition from the manufacturing operations of some of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	In the past, some of our customers moved a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Any of these developments could cause a decline in our sales, loss of market acceptance of our products or services, decreases of our profits or loss of our market share.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As a provider of design and manufacturing services and components for electronics, we must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround time for our customers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and we often experience reduced lead times in customer orders which may be less than the lead time we require to procure necessary components and materials.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of our customers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	This makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In that regard, we must make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, setting production schedules, making component procurement commitments, and allocating personnel and other resources based on our estimates of our customers' requirements.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S5	On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production or require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to reduce costs or achieve other objectives.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S6	These demands stress our resources, can cause supply chain management issues, and reduce our margins.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S7	We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands, and transfers from one facility to another can result in inefficiencies and costs due to excess capacity in one facility and corresponding capacity constraints at another.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S8	Many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, thus customer order fluctuations, deferrals, and transfers of demand from one facility to another, as described above, have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past and we may experience such effects in the future.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S9	Our industry is extremely competitive; if we are not able to continue to provide competitive services, we may lose business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S10	We compete with a number of different companies, depending on the type of service we provide or the location of our operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S11	For example, we compete with major global EMS providers, other smaller EMS companies that have a regional or product-specific focus and ODMs with respect to some of the services that we provide.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S12	We also compete with our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S13	Our industry is extremely competitive, many of our competitors have achieved substantial market share, and some may have lower cost structures or greater design, manufacturing, financial or other resources than we do.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S14	We face particular competition from Asian-based competitors, including Taiwanese ODM suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S15	If we are unable to provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at lower cost than the other companies in our market, our net sales could decline.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S16	A significant percentage of our sales come from a small number of customers and a decline in sales to any of these customers could adversely affect our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S17	Sales to our ten largest customers represent a significant percentage of our net sales.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S18	Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 43% , 46% and 50% of net sales in fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P4_S19	No customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2017 and only Lenovo/Motorola, which is reflected in our CTG segment, accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2016 and 2015 .
866374_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our principal customers have varied from year to year.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Significant reductions in sales to any of these customers, or the loss of major customers, would materially harm our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we are not able to timely replace expired, canceled or reduced contracts with new business, our revenues and profitability could be harmed.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Additionally, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or other significant transactions involving our key customers generally entail risks to our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by the largest customers, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Our components business is dependent on our ability to quickly launch world-class components products, and our investment in the development of our component capabilities, together with the start-up and integration costs necessary to achieve quick launches of world-class components products, may adversely affect our margins and profitability.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Our components business, which includes rigid and flexible printed circuit board fabrication, and power supply manufacturing, is part of our strategy to improve our competitive position and to grow our future margins, profitability and shareholder returns by expanding our capabilities.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S6	The success of our components business is dependent on our ability to design and introduce world- class components that have performance characteristics which are suitable for a broad market and that offer significant price and/or performance advantages over competitive products.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S7	To create these world class components offerings, we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our components capabilities, in resources such as research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, facility expansions and personnel requirements.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S8	We may not be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance for any of our components offerings in any of our current or target markets.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S9	The success of our components business will also depend upon the level of market acceptance of our customers' end products, which incorporate our components, and over which we have no control.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S10	In addition, customers often require unique configurations or custom designs, which must be developed and integrated in the customer's product well before the customer launches the product.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S11	Thus, there is often substantial lead-time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized component and the commencement of volume shipments of the component to the customer.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S12	As a result, we may make substantial investments in the development and customization of products for our customers, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not accept the customized component.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S13	Even if our customers accept the customized component, if our customers do not purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Our achievement of anticipated levels of profitability in our components business is also dependent on our ability to achieve efficiencies in our manufacturing as well as to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our customers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S15	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability in our components business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S16	Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S17	We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S18	If some of our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our products from these customers could decline.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S19	Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty we could have difficulty sourcing supplies necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S20	If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P6_S21	Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivable are outstanding.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	On April 21, 2016, SunEdison, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries ("SunEdison") filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we recognized a bad debt reserve charge of $61.0 million associated with our outstanding SunEdison receivables and accepted return of previously shipped inventory of approximately $90 million.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, prices for solar panel modules declined significantly.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We determined that certain solar panel inventory previously designated for SunEdison on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 was not fully recoverable and recorded a charge of $60.0 million to reduce the carrying costs to market during fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In addition we recognized a $16.0 million impairment charge for solar module equipment and incurred $16.9 million of incremental costs primarily related to negative margin sales and other associated solar panel direct costs.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	The estimates underlying our recorded provisions, as well as consideration of other potential customer bankruptcy-related contingencies associated with the SunEdison bankruptcy proceedings, are based on the facts currently known to us.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P7_S6	No preference claims have been asserted against the Company and consideration has been given to the related contingencies based on the facts currently known to us.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are unable to reasonably estimate a loss or any range of possible loss.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	defenses to any potential claims for recovery and intend to vigorously defend any such claim, if asserted.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	An unfavorable resolution of this matter could be material to our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We may be adversely affected by shortages of required electronic components.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	From time to time, we have experienced shortages of some of the electronic components that we use.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	These shortages can result from strong demand for those components or from problems experienced by suppliers, such as shortages of raw materials.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	These unanticipated component shortages could result in curtailed production or delays in production, which may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a reduction in sales, increase in inventory levels and costs, and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Component shortages may also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S8	As a result, component shortages could adversely affect our operating results.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to incorporate changes in component costs into the selling prices for our products.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Our supply chain may also be impacted by other events outside our control, including macro-economic events, political crises or natural or environmental occurrences.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Our margins and profitability may be adversely affected due to substantial investments, start-up and production ramp costs in our design services.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	As part of our strategy to enhance our end-to-end service offerings, we continue to expand our design and engineering capabilities.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Providing these services can expose us to different or greater potential risks than those we face when providing our manufacturing services.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Although we enter into contracts with our design services customers, we may design and develop products for these customers prior to receiving a purchase order or other firm commitment from them.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We are required to make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Even if our customers accept our designs, if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Our design activities often require that we purchase inventory for initial production runs before we have a purchase commitment from a customer.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Even after we have a contract with a customer with respect to a product, these contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any particular volume of purchases.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P10_S7	These contracts can generally be terminated on short notice.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P10_S8	In addition, some of the products we design and develop must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some must receive government certifications.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P10_S9	If we fail to obtain these approvals or certifications on a timely basis, we would be unable to sell these products, which would harm our sales, profitability and reputation.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our design services offerings require significant investments in research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, patent applications, facility expansion and recruitment.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We may not be able to achieve a high enough level of sales for this business to be profitable.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The initial costs of investing in the resources necessary to expand our design and engineering capabilities, and in particular to support our design services offerings, have historically adversely affected our profitability, and may continue to do so as we continue to make investments to grow these capabilities.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, we agree to certain product price limitations and cost reduction targets in connection with these services.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Inflationary and other increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor required to produce the products have occurred and may recur from time to time.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Also, the production ramps for these programs are typically significant and negatively impact our margin in early stages as the manufacturing volumes are lower and result in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We may not be able to reduce costs, incorporate changes in costs into the selling prices of our products, or increase operating efficiencies as we ramp production of our products, which would adversely affect our margins and our results of operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to the risks inherent in international operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The geographic distances between the Americas, Asia and Europe create a number of logistical and communications challenges for us.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These challenges include managing operations across multiple time zones, directing the manufacture and delivery of products across distances, coordinating procurement of components and raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations, and coordinating the activities and decisions of the core management team, which is based in a number of different countries.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Facilities in several different locations may be involved at different stages of the production process of a single product, leading to additional logistical difficulties.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Because our manufacturing operations are located in a number of countries throughout the Americas, Asia and Europe, we are subject to risks of changes in economic and political conditions in those countries, including:
866374_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	a potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The attractiveness of our services to U.S. customers can be affected by changes in U.S. trade policies, such as most favored nation status and trade preferences for some Asian countries.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, some countries in which we operate, such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Mexico, Malaysia and Poland, have experienced periods of slow or negative growth, high inflation, significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Furthermore, in countries such as China, Brazil and Mexico, governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy, and their actions could have a significant effect on us.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure, including lack of adequate power and water supplies, transportation, raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In addition, we may encounter labor disruptions and rising labor costs, in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Any increase in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P15_S8	In some countries, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert our cash distributions to U.S. dollars or other freely convertible currencies, or to move funds from our accounts in these countries.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Furthermore, the central bank of any of these countries may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to approve distributions to foreign investors.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our operating costs.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We have manufacturing operations and industrial parks that are located in lower cost regions of the world, such as Asia, Eastern Europe and Mexico.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in these currencies impacting our fixed cost overhead or our supply base relative to the currencies in which we conduct transactions.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors, including changes in a country's political and economic policies.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Volatility in the functional and non-functional currencies of our entities and the United States dollar could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The primary impact of currency exchange fluctuations is on the cash, receivables, payables and expenses of our operating entities.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As part of our currency hedging strategy, we use financial instruments such as forward exchange, swap contracts, and options to hedge our foreign currency exposure in order to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on our operating results.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If our hedging activities are not successful or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected fluctuations in our operating results as a result of changes in exchange rates.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We are also exposed to risks related to the valuation of the Chinese currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The Chinese currency is the renminbi ("RMB").
866374_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	A significant increase in the value of the RMB could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows by increasing both our manufacturing costs and the costs of our local supply base.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If our IT or physical security systems are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information systems.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and inventory and protecting our customers' and our suppliers' confidential information.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools, we are subject to, and at times have suffered from, breach of these security systems which have in the past and may in the future result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or unauthorized use or theft of the inventory or information we are trying to protect.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If unauthorized parties gain physical access to our inventory or if they gain electronic access to our information systems or if such information or inventory is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information or inventory could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties including our customers and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information or inventory, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our strategic relationships with major customers create risks.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In the past, we have completed numerous strategic transactions with customers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Under these arrangements, we generally acquire inventory, equipment and other assets from the customers, and lease or acquire their manufacturing facilities, while simultaneously entering into multi-year manufacturing and supply agreements for the production of their products.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We may pursue these customer divestiture transactions in the future.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	These arrangements entered into with divesting customers typically involve many risks, including the following:
866374_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	if demand for the customers' products declines, the customer may reduce its volume of purchases, and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other customers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In addition, these strategic arrangements have not, and in the future may not, result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings per share.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If our compliance policies are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We have implemented local and global compliance policies to ensure compliance with our legal obligations across our operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	A significant legal risk resulting from our international operations is compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local laws of the countries in which we do business, including the UK Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits covered companies from making payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Our Code of Business Conduct prohibits corrupt payments on a global basis and precludes us from offering or giving anything of value to a government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, to win a business advantage or to improperly influence a decision regarding Flex.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents will refrain from taking actions in violation of this and our related anti-corruption policies and procedures.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P23_S9	We are subject to the risk of increased income taxes.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated efforts by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns over perceived international tax avoidance techniques, which could ultimately have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	For example, legislative changes may result from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project or any U.S. tax reform, which has been stated to be a priority for the new U.S. presidential administration and U.S. Congress.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Any such changes, if adopted, could adversely impact our effective tax rate.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Our taxes could also increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Our continued ability to qualify for specific tax holiday extensions will depend on, among other things, our anticipated investment and expansion in these countries and the manner in which the local governments interpret the requirements for modifications, extensions or new incentives.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P25_S5	In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions around the world.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	However, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax provision, operating results, financial position and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	If we do not effectively manage changes in our operations, our business may be harmed; we have taken substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may need to take material restructuring charges in the future.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	The expansion of our business, as well as business contractions and other changes in our customers' requirements, have in the past, and may in the future, require that we adjust our business and cost structures by incurring restructuring charges.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Restructuring activities involve reductions in our workforce at some locations and closure of certain facilities.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P26_S7	All of these changes have in the past placed, and may in the future place, considerable strain on our financial and management control systems and resources, including decision support, accounting management, information systems and facilities.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P26_S8	If we do not properly manage our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures to manage our employees, our business could be harmed.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P26_S9	In recent years, including during fiscal year 2017, we undertook initiatives to restructure our business operations through a series of restructuring activities, which were intended to accelerate our ability to support more Sketch-to-Scale tm efforts across the Company and reposition away from historical legacy programs and structures through rationalizing our current footprint at existing sites and at corporate SG A functions.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P26_S10	These activities were primarily for employee termination costs.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	principles generally accepted in the United States to be separately disclosed as restructuring charges in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, and are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our restructuring activities undertaken during fiscal year 2017 have been disclosed separately on our statement of operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We may be required to take additional charges in the future to align our operations and cost structures with global economic conditions, market demands, cost competitiveness, and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers' production requirements.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	We may consolidate certain manufacturing facilities or transfer certain of our operations to lower cost geographies.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	If we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Additionally, there are other potential risks associated with our restructurings that could adversely affect us, such as delays encountered with the finalization and implementation of the restructuring activities, work stoppages, and the failure to achieve targeted cost savings.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Changes in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	For example, significant changes to revenue recognition rules have been enacted and will begin to apply to us in fiscal year 2019 as the FASB has proposed.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Changes to accounting rules or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We may encounter difficulties with acquisitions and divestitures, which could harm our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We have completed numerous acquisitions of businesses and we may acquire additional businesses in the future.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Any future acquisitions may require additional equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, or additional debt financing, which could increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P29_S5	As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P29_S6	To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P29_S7	The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P29_S8	The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P29_S9	In addition, the integration of acquired businesses may require that we incur significant restructuring charges.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P29_S10	In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including:
866374_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, divestitures involve significant risks, including without limitation, difficulty finding financially sufficient buyers or selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and, under certain circumstances, require us to record impairment charges or a loss as a result of the transaction.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, completing divestitures requires expenses and management attention and could leave us with certain continuing liabilities.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	These and other factors have harmed, and in the future could harm, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition or divestiture, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The success of certain of our activities depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We retain certain intellectual property rights to some of the technologies that we develop as part of our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The measures we have taken to prevent unauthorized use of our technology may not be successful.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties, as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our customers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S6	In addition, our customers are increasingly requiring us to indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S7	If any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S8	In the event of such an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S9	We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S10	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly, and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of outcome.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S11	We are subject to risks relating to litigation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S12	From time to time, we are involved in various claims, suits, investigations and legal proceedings.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S13	Additional legal claims or regulatory matters may arise in the future and could involve matters relating to commercial disputes, government regulatory and compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax, employment or shareholder issues, product liability claims and other issues on a global basis.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S14	If we receive an adverse judgment in any litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages and cease certain practices or activities.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S15	Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be both time- consuming and disruptive to our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S16	The defense and ultimate outcome of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operating expenses and a decrease in operating margin, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S17	We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for medical devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S18	As a medical device manufacturer, we have additional compliance requirements.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S19	We are required to register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S20	Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring by the FDA.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S21	If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance with QSR or other FDA regulations, and the Company does not address the observation adequately to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA may take action against us.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S22	FDA actions may include issuing a letter of inspectional observations, issuing a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the Company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, refusing requests for clearance or approval of new products or withdrawal of clearance or approval previously granted, issuing an import detention on products entering the U.S. from an offshore facility, or shutting down a manufacturing facility.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P31_S23	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In the European Union ("EU"), we are required to maintain certain standardized certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections to obtain and maintain these certifications.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Continued noncompliance to the EU regulations could stop the flow of products into the EU from us or from our customers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In China, the Safe Food and Drug Administration controls and regulates the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We must comply with the regulatory laws applicable to medical device manufactures or our ability to manufacture products in China could be impacted.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In Japan, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws regulate the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	These regulations also require that subcontractors manufacturing products intended for sale in Japan register with authorities and submit to regulatory audits.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Other Asian countries and Latin America where we operate have similar laws regarding the regulation of medical device manufacturing.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	If our products or components contain defects, demand for our services may decline and we may be exposed to product liability and product warranty liability.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation and expose us to product liability or product warranty claims.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Product liability claims may include liability for personal injury or property damage.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Product warranty claims may include liability to pay for the recall, repair or replacement of a product or component.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Although we generally allocate liability for these claims in our contracts with our customers, increasingly we are unsuccessful in allocating such liability, and even where we have allocated liability to our customers, our customers may not have the resources to satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product or component for which they have assumed responsibility.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	If we design, engineer or manufacture a product or component that is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could spend a significant amount of money to resolve the claim.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S5	In addition, product liability and product recall insurance coverage are expensive and may not be available for some or all of our services offerings on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S6	A successful product liability or product warranty claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied, limited or is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S7	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to seasonal demand.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S8	Two of our significant end markets are the mobile devices market and the consumer devices market.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S9	These markets exhibit particular strength generally in the two quarters leading up to the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S10	As a result, we have historically experienced stronger revenues in our second and third fiscal quarters as compared to our other fiscal quarters.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S11	Economic or other factors leading to diminished orders in the end of the calendar year could harm our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S12	We depend on our executive officers and skilled management personnel.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S13	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S14	Generally, our employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S15	We could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S16	We will need to recruit and retain skilled management personnel, and if we are not able to do so, our business could be harmed.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S17	In addition, in connection with expanding our design services offerings, we must attract and retain experienced design engineers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S18	There is substantial competition in our industry for highly skilled employees.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S19	Our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our design services offerings, which could adversely affect our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S20	Our failure to comply with environmental laws could adversely affect our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S21	We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including regulations governing the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used in our manufacturing processes.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S22	We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the recyclability of products, the materials that may be included in products, and our obligations to dispose of these products after end users have finished with them.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S23	Additionally, we may be exposed to liability to our customers relating to the materials that may be included in the components that we procure for our customers' products.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S24	Any violation or alleged violation by us of environmental laws could subject us to significant costs, fines or other penalties.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S25	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of global and local product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S26	We are subject to the EU directives, including the Restrictions on RoHS, the WEEE as well as the EU's REACH regulation.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P36_S27	In addition, new technical classifications of e-Waste being discussed in the Basel Convention technical working group could affect both our customers' abilities and obligations in electronics repair and refurbishment.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Also of note is China's Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by EIPs regulation, commonly referred to as "China RoHS", which restricts the importation into and production within China of electrical equipment containing certain hazardous materials.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as applicable regulations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	These programs may include collecting compliance data from our suppliers, full laboratory testing and public reporting of other environmental metrics such as carbon emissions, electronic waste and water, and we also require our supply chain to comply.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In the case of WEEE, the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	However, customers may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their obligations under WEEE.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In addition, we are responsible for the cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed, or the results of future testing and analyses at our current or former operating facilities indicate that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the air, ground and/or water, we may be subject to additional liability.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Additional environmental matters may arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Additionally, we could be required to alter our manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental regulations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations or adequately address contaminated sites could limit our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to incur significant expenses, which would harm our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in the payment of significant damages, which would reduce our net income.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S6	We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, wages and overtime, discrimination, whistle-blowing, classification of employees and severance payments.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Enforcement activity relating to these laws, particularly outside of the United States, can increase as a result of increased media attention due to violations by other companies, changes in law, political and other factors.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S8	There can be no assurance that we won't be found to have violated such laws in the future, due to a more aggressive enforcement posture by governmental authorities or for any other reason.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S9	Any such violations could lead to the assessment of fines against us by federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees, which fines could be substantial and which would reduce our net income.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S10	Our business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S11	We may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S12	Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, may not align with our business strategies and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S13	Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers and other third parties.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S14	Our debt level may create limitations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S15	As of March 31, 2017 , our total debt was approximately $3.0 billion .
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S16	This level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S17	Changes in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital or to borrow additional funds.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S18	We may also be exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our outstanding borrowings and investments.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S19	Our credit is rated by credit rating agencies.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S20	Our 4.625% Notes, our 5.000% Notes and our 4.750% Notes are currently rated BBB- by Standard and Poor's ("S P") which is considered to be investment grade by S P, rated Baa3 by Moody s which is considered to be investment grade by Moody's, and rated BBB- by Fitch which is considered to be "investment grade" by Fitch.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S21	Any decline in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all, negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares, increase our interest payments under some of our existing debt agreements, and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S22	In addition, the interest rate payable on some of our credit facilities is subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit ratings change.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S23	Thus, any potential future negative change in our credit rating may increase the interest rate payable on these credit facilities.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S24	In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk under our variable rate terms loans, bilateral facilities and revolving credit facility for indebtedness we have incurred or may incur under such borrowings.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S25	The interest rates under these borrowings are based on either (i) a margin over LIBOR or (ii) the base rate (the greatest of the agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin, in each case depending on our credit rating.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S26	Refer to the discussion in note 7, "Bank Borrowings and Long-Term Debt" to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our debt obligations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P40_S27	We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our invested cash balances, our securitization facilities and our factoring activities.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Weak global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and access to capital markets.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which our customers compete.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	For example, these conditions may be adversely impacted by the pending withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU following its referendum on EU membership and the position that the U.S. will take with respect to certain treaty and trade relationships with other countries.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	These conditions may result in reduced consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries, a tightening in the credit markets, a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets, high volatility in credit, fixed income and equity markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and global economic uncertainty.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In addition, longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other corporate purposes.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters, terrorist activity, public health issues, cyber security incidents, interruptions of service from utilities, transportation or telecommunications providers, or other catastrophic events.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P42_S7	While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	However, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P43_S4	The policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of self-insurance.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P43_S6	Our business could be adversely affected by any delays, or increased costs, resulting from issues that our common carriers are dealing with in transporting our materials, our products, or both.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We rely on a variety of common carriers to transport our materials from our suppliers to us, and to transport our products from us to our customers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Problems suffered by any of these common carriers, whether due to a natural disaster, labor problem, increased energy prices, criminal activity or some other issue, could result in shipping delays, increased costs, or other supply chain disruptions, and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We are subject to risks associated with investments.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We invest in private funds and companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We make investments in private funds and companies to further our strategic objectives, support key business initiatives and develop business relationships with related portfolio companies.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P45_S4	If any of the funds or companies in which we invest fail, we could lose all or part of our investment.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P45_S5	If we need to determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we would need to write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of "conflict minerals" may result in increased costs and risks to us.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals ("Minerals"), which may have originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In May 2016, we filed our report on Form SD for the year ended December 31, 2015 to report that, based on our diligence review, we were unable to determine whether Minerals contained in our products originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries or whether the mining or trade of such Minerals directly or indirectly financed or otherwise benefited armed groups in those countries.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We expect to undertake further reviews of our supply chain in 2017 and beyond as necessary to comply with the SEC s disclosure requirements.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Additionally, customers rely on us to provide critical data regarding the products they purchase and request information on such Minerals.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Our materials sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and we may not be able to easily verify the origins of the Minerals used in the products we sell.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P47_S5	We have many suppliers and each may provide the required information in a different manner, if at all.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, our reputation may suffer if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the Minerals, if any, used in our products.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P47_S7	Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of any Minerals originating in the specified countries.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P47_S8	The implementation of this requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from our suppliers.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P47_S9	This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide products and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our business and operations could be adversely impacted by climate change initiatives.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Concern over climate change has led to international legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We also ascribe value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships, developed technology and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if we determine that the fair values of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	We evaluate, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Refer to notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements and 'critical accounting policies' in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P50_S5	A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of our businesses and we could be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact our consolidated balance sheet, as well as our consolidated statement of operations.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P50_S6	If we are required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact our consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under our existing credit facilities, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The market price of our ordinary shares is volatile.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of companies, including technology companies.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	These fluctuations have often been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	The market for our ordinary shares has been and may in the future be subject to similar volatility.
866374_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Factors such as fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of technological innovations or events affecting other companies in the electronics industry, currency fluctuations, general market fluctuations, and macro-economic conditions may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.
866374_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The composition of the square footage of our facilities, by region, is as follows:
866374_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our facilities include large industrial parks, ranging in size from 0.6 million to 4.9 million square feet in Brazil, China, Malaysia, Mexico and Poland.
866374_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also have regional manufacturing operations, generally ranging in size from under 100,000 to approximately 1.6 million square feet in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, the Ukraine and the United States.
866374_17_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also have smaller design and engineering centers, innovation centers and product introduction centers at a number of locations in the world's major industrial and electronics markets.
866374_17_ITEM2_P1_S3	Our facilities are well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted.
866374_17_ITEM2_P1_S4	The productive capacity of our plants is adequate for current needs.

866374_17_ITEM5_P9_S1	Singapore does not impose a withholding tax on dividends.
866374_17_ITEM5_P9_S2	All dividends are tax exempt to shareholders.
866374_17_ITEM5_P10_S0	Under current Singapore tax law there is no tax on capital gains, thus any profits from the disposal of shares are not taxable in Singapore unless the gains arising from the disposal of shares are income in nature and subject to tax, especially if they arise from activities which the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore regards as the carrying on of a trade or business in Singapore (in which case, the profits on the sale would be taxable as trade profits rather than capital gains).
866374_17_ITEM5_P10_S1	Shareholders who apply, or who are required to apply, the Singapore Financial Reporting Standard 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement ("FRS 39") for the purposes of Singapore income tax may be required to recognize gains or losses (not being gains or losses in the nature of capital) in accordance with the provisions of FRS 39 (as modified by the applicable provisions of Singapore income tax law) even though no sale or disposal of shares is made.
866374_17_ITEM5_P11_S0	There is no stamp duty payable for holding shares, and no duty is payable on the issue of new shares.
866374_17_ITEM5_P11_S1	When existing shares are acquired in Singapore, a stamp duty of 0.2% is payable on the instrument of transfer of the shares at market value.
866374_17_ITEM5_P11_S2	The stamp duty is borne by the purchaser unless there is an agreement to the contrary.
866374_17_ITEM5_P11_S3	If the instrument of transfer is executed outside of Singapore, the stamp duty must be paid only if the instrument of transfer is received in Singapore.
866374_17_ITEM5_P12_S0	The estate duty was abolished for deaths occurring on or after February 15, 2008.
866374_17_ITEM5_P13_S0	For deaths prior to February 15, 2008 the following rules apply: If an individual who is not domiciled in Singapore dies on or after January 1, 2002, no estate tax is payable in Singapore on any of our shares held by the individual.

866374_17_ITEM5_P14_S0	An individual shareholder who is a U.S. citizen or resident (for U.S. estate tax purposes) will have the value of the shares included in the individual's gross estate for U.S. estate tax purposes.

866374_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	OVERVIEW We are a globally-recognized, provider of Sketch-to-Scale tm services - innovative design, engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain services and solutions - from conceptual sketch to full-scale production.
866374_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	chain optimization for non-electronics products such as footwear and clothing; Industrial and Emerging Industries ("IEI"), which is comprised of energy and metering, semiconductor and capital equipment, office solutions, household industrial and lifestyle, industrial automation and kiosks, and lighting; and High Reliability Solutions ("HRS"), which is comprised of our medical business, including consumer health, digital health, disposables, precision plastics, drug delivery, diagnostics, life sciences and imaging equipment; our automotive business, including vehicle electrification, connectivity, autonomous vehicles, and clean technologies; and our defense and aerospace businesses, focused on commercial aviation, defense and military.
866374_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our strategy is to provide customers with a full range of cost competitive, vertically-integrated global supply chain solutions through which we can design, build, ship and service a complete packaged product for our customers.
866374_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	This enables our customers to leverage our supply chain solutions to meet their product requirements throughout the entire product life cycle.
866374_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Over the past few years, we have seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, primarily in the technology sector.
866374_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Some companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, Internet service providers or e-commerce retailers have entered the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology hardware markets, such as mobile devices, home entertainment and wearable devices.
866374_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	This trend has resulted in a significant change in the manufacturing and supply chain solutions requirements of such companies.
866374_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	While the products have become more complex, the supply chain solutions required by such companies have become more customized and demanding, and it has changed the manufacturing and supply chain landscape significantly.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	We use a portfolio approach to manage our extensive service offerings.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	As our customers change the way they go to market, we are able to reorganize and rebalance our business portfolio in order to align with our customers' needs and requirements in an effort to optimize operating results.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	The objective of our business model is to allow us to be flexible and redeploy and reposition our assets and resources as necessary to meet specific customer's supply chain solutions needs across all of the markets we serve and earn a return on our invested capital above the weighted average cost of that capital.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	During the past few years, we have made significant efforts to evolve our long-term portfolio towards a higher mix of businesses which possess longer product life cycles and higher segment operating margins such as reflected in our IEI and HRS businesses.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	During the last two fiscal years, we launched several programs broadly across our portfolio of services and in some instances we deployed certain new technologies.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S5	Some of these programs have started to yield better results, as demonstrated by our segment operating margin improvement while our sales decreased compared to the prior year.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S6	We continue to invest in innovation and we have expanded our design and engineering relationships through our product innovation centers.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S7	We believe that our business transformation has strategically positioned us to take advantage of the long-term, future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities, design and engineering services and after-market services, which remain strong.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S8	We are one of the world's largest providers of global supply chain solutions, with revenues of $23.9 billion in fiscal year 2017 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S9	We have established an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world's major consumer electronics and industrial markets (Asia, the Americas, and Europe) in order to serve the growing outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional customers.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S10	We design, build, ship, and service consumer electronics and industrial products for our customers through a network of over 100 facilities in approximately 30 countries across four continents.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S11	As of March 31, 2017 , our total manufacturing capacity was approximately 27 million square feet.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S12	In fiscal year 2017 , our net sales in Asia, the Americas and Europe represented approximately 46% , 36% and 18% , respectively, of our total net sales, based on the location of the manufacturing site.
866374_17_ITEM7_P3_S13	The following tables set forth net sales and net property and equipment, by country, based on the location of our manufacturing sites and the relative percentages:
866374_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We believe that the combination of our extensive open innovation platform solutions, design and engineering services, advanced supply chain management solutions and services, significant scale and global presence, and industrial campuses in low-cost geographic areas provide us with a competitive advantage and strong differentiation in the market for designing, manufacturing and servicing consumer electronics and industrial products for leading multinational and regional customers.
866374_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	Specifically, we have launched multiple product innovation centers ("PIC") focused exclusively on offering our customers the ability to simplify their global product development, manufacturing process, and after sales services, and enable them to meaningfully accelerate their time to market and cost savings.
866374_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including the following:
866374_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	changes in trade regulations and treaties.
866374_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	We also are subject to other risks as outlined in Item 1A, "Risk Factors".
866374_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Net sales for fiscal year 2017 declined from the prior year, decreasing by 2.3% or $0.6 billion to $23.9 billion .
866374_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	The decrease was primarily due to a $0.6 billion decrease in our CTG segment as well as a $0.5 billion decrease in our CEC segment, partially offset by a $0.3 billion increase in our IEI segment, and a $0.2 billion increase in our HRS segment.
866374_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	to accelerate our ability to support more Sketch-to-Scale tm efforts across the Company and reposition away from historical legacy programs and structures.
866374_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our net income totaled $319.6 million , representing a decrease of $124.5 million , or 28.0% , compared to fiscal year 2016 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	The decrease in net income during fiscal year 2017 is primarily due to the same factors explained above.
866374_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	Cash provided by operations remained consistent at $1.1 billion for the fiscal years 2017 and 2016 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	Cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately $0.7 billion to a total amount of $0.7 billion for fiscal year 2017 compared with $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the amount of cash paid for acquired businesses during fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM7_P7_S5	Our average net working capital, defined as accounts receivable, including deferred purchase price receivable from our asset-backed securitization programs plus inventory less accounts payable, as a percentage of annualized sales decreased by 0.8% to 6.9% .
866374_17_ITEM7_P7_S6	Our free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment, was $660.4 million for fiscal year 2017 compared to $639.5 million for fiscal year 2016 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P7_S7	The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to higher cash flows from operations.
866374_17_ITEM7_P7_S8	Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for the free cash flows reconciliation to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of cash flows from operations.
866374_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Cash used in financing activities amounted to $242.1 million during fiscal year 2017 , which changed $491.7 million from a cash inflow of $249.6 million in the prior year primarily due to lower net proceeds from bank borrowings and long-term debt.
866374_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
866374_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
866374_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
866374_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	We recognize manufacturing revenue when we ship goods or the goods are received by our customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured.
866374_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Generally, there are no formal substantive customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services.
866374_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	If such requirements or obligations exist, then we recognize the related revenues at the time when such requirements are completed and the obligations are fulfilled.
866374_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Some of our customer contracts allow us to recover certain costs related to manufacturing services that are over and above the prices we charge for the related products.
866374_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	We determine the amount of costs that are recoverable based on historical experiences and agreements with those customers.
866374_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	Also, certain customer contracts may contain certain commitments and obligations that may result in additional expenses or decrease in revenue.
866374_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	We accrue for these commitments and obligations based on facts and circumstances and contractual terms.
866374_17_ITEM7_P11_S4	We also make provisions for estimated sales returns and other adjustments at the time revenue is recognized based upon contractual terms and an analysis of historical returns.
866374_17_ITEM7_P11_S5	Provisions for sales returns and other adjustments were not material to our consolidated financial statements for any of the periods presented.
866374_17_ITEM7_P11_S6	We also recognize revenue in accordance with multiple-element arrangements accounting codified under U.S. GAAP for arrangements that contain multiple deliverables.
866374_17_ITEM7_P11_S7	We determined that our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of arrangements where multiple product components are sold together as part of a complete system.
866374_17_ITEM7_P11_S8	Depending on the contractual provisions of the respective contracts, we have concluded that the units of accounting for such arrangements are, in most cases, comprised of an aggregation of product components, however, may also be established at the product component level.
866374_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	For multiple-element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices.
866374_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Relative selling prices are based first on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), then on third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE ) when VSOE does not exist, and then on management's best estimate of the selling price ( BESP ) when VSOE and TPE do not exist.
866374_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	We base the allocation of revenue on BESP, because we do not have either VSOE or TPE for the respective deliverables.
866374_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	We provide a comprehensive suite of services for our customers that range from advanced product design to manufacturing and logistics to after-sales services.
866374_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	We recognize service revenue when the services have been performed, and the related costs are expensed as incurred.
866374_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	Our net sales for services were less than 10% of our total sales for all periods presented, and accordingly, are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Customer Credit Risk We have an established customer credit policy through which we manage customer credit exposures through credit evaluations, credit limit setting, monitoring, and enforcement of credit limits for new and existing customers.
866374_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and make provisions for doubtful accounts based on the outcome of those credit evaluations.
866374_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances, current economic trends, historical experience with collections and the age of past due receivables.
866374_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	To the extent we identify exposures as a result of credit or customer evaluations, we also review other customer related exposures, including but not limited to inventory and related contractual obligations.
866374_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	On April 21, 2016, SunEdison, Inc. (together with certain of its subsidiaries, "SunEdison"), filed a petition for reorganization under bankruptcy law.
866374_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we recognized a bad debt reserve charge of $61.0 million associated with our outstanding SunEdison receivables and accepted return of previously shipped inventory of approximately $90.0 million.
866374_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, prices for solar panel modules declined significantly.
866374_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	We determined that certain solar panel inventory previously designated for SunEdison on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 was not fully recoverable and recorded a charge of $60.0 million to reduce the carrying costs to market during fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM7_P14_S4	In addition, we recognized a $16.0 million impairment charge for solar module equipment and incurred $16.9 million of incremental costs primarily related to negative margin sales and other associated solar panel direct costs.
866374_17_ITEM7_P14_S5	The total charge of $92.9 million is included in cost of sales for fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Restructuring Charges We recognize restructuring charges related to our plans to close or consolidate excess manufacturing facilities and rationalize administrative functions and to realign our corporate cost structure.
866374_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	In connection with these activities, we recognize restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other exit-related costs.
866374_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	The recognition of these restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	To the extent our actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_17_ITEM7_P15_S4	Such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_17_ITEM7_P15_S5	At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_17_ITEM7_P15_S6	Refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Inventory Valuation Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value.
866374_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short-term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand.
866374_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	We purchase our inventory based on forecasted demand, and we estimate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand, and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers.
866374_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	If actual market conditions or our customers' product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional write downs may be required.
866374_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	In addition, unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers and/or changes in economic conditions may require additional write downs for inventories due to our customers' inability to fulfill their contractual obligations with regard to inventory procured to fulfill customer demand.
866374_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets We review property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
866374_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of these long-lived assets exceeds their fair value.
866374_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Recoverability of property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets are measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
866374_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets exceeds fair value.
866374_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our judgments regarding projected cash flows for an extended period of time and the fair value of assets may be impacted by changes in market conditions, general business environment and other factors.
866374_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	To the extent our estimates relating to cash flows and fair value of assets change adversely we may have to recognize additional impairment charges in the future.
866374_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
866374_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors, market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis.
866374_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	The Company performed its goodwill impairment assessment on January 1, 2017 and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test because the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
866374_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	We may be exposed to certain liabilities relating to our business operations, acquisitions of businesses and assets and other activities.
866374_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	We make provisions for such liabilities when it is probable that the settlement of the liability will result in an outflow of economic resources or the impairment of an asset.
866374_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	We make these assessments based on facts and circumstances that may change in the future resulting in additional expenses.
866374_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Income Taxes Our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, which will result in deductible amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards.
866374_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	Based on estimates, the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize these deferred income tax assets.
866374_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors.
866374_17_ITEM7_P23_S3	If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets previously recognized, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.
866374_17_ITEM7_P23_S4	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_17_ITEM7_P23_S5	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_17_ITEM7_P23_S6	Refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our tax position.
866374_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies The financial position and results of operations for certain of our subsidiaries are measured using a currency other than the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
866374_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Accordingly, all assets and liabilities for these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet dates.
866374_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Revenue and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period.
866374_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	Cumulative gains and losses from the translation of these subsidiaries' financial statements are reported as other comprehensive loss, a component of shareholders' equity.
866374_17_ITEM7_P24_S4	Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved, and re-measurement adjustments for foreign operations where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, are included in operating results.
866374_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales.
866374_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	The data below, and discussion that follows, represents our results from operations.
866374_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Net sales Net sales during fiscal year 2017 totaled $23.9 billion , representing a decrease of $0.6 billion , or 2.3% , from $24.4 billion during fiscal year 2016 , largely attributable to the closure of our Lenovo/Motorola dedicated China operations.
866374_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	During fiscal year 2017 , net sales decreased $0.8 billion in Asia, while increasing $0.2 billion in the Americas, and $35.6 million in Europe.
866374_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	Net sales during fiscal year 2016 totaled $24.4 billion , representing a decrease of $1.7 billion , or 6.6% , from $26.1 billion during fiscal year 2015 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	During fiscal year 2016 , net sales decreased $1.2 billion in Asia, $0.6 billion in the Americas, and $14.7 million in Europe.
866374_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	The following table sets forth net sales by segments and their relative percentages.
866374_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Historical information has been recast to reflect realignment of customers and/or products between segments:
866374_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2017 decreased $0.6 billion or 9% in the CTG segment and $0.5 billion or 5% in the CEC segment.
866374_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	The decline in sales for CTG was primarily due to a decline in demand from our largest smartphone customer Lenovo/Motorola in connection with our exit of a China operation dedicated to them, partially offset by revenues from our Bose acquisition as well as ramping of a broad mix of customers.
866374_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	The decrease in CEC is largely attributable to lower sales within our legacy server and storage business.
866374_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	These decreases were partially offset by a $287.0 million or 6% increase in sales from our IEI segment driven by contribution from our NEXTracker Inc. ("NEXTracker") acquisition and expansion within our capital equipment business, and by a $250.4 million or 6% increase in sales from our HRS segment primarily driven by automotive business.
866374_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2016 decreased $1.9 billion or 22% in the CTG segment and $349.6 million or 4% in the CEC segment.
866374_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	The drop in CTG was due to a decline in demand from our largest customer in our mobile business offset by expansion across wearables, connected home and gaming markets.
866374_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	The decrease in CEC is primarily attributable to lower sales within our server and storage business.
866374_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	These decreases were partially offset by a $341.7 million or 10% increase in sales from our HRS segment, and by a $221.4 million or 5% increase in sales from our IEI segment.
866374_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	These increases in HRS and IEI were attributable to an increase across multiple product categories and customers, most notably in our household, energy, automotive, and medical businesses primarily as a result of our strategic acquisitions in both segments referred to below.
866374_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	Our ten largest customers during fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 accounted for approximately 43% , 46% and 50% of net sales, respectively.
866374_17_ITEM7_P29_S6	We have made substantial efforts toward the diversification of our portfolio which allow us to operate at scale in so many different industries, as a result no customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM7_P29_S7	During fiscal years 2016 and 2015 , only Lenovo/Motorola (including net sales from its former parent, Google, up to the point in time when Motorola Mobility was acquired by Lenovo and including net sales from Lenovo thereafter), which is reflected in our CTG segment, accounted for greater than 10% of net sales.
866374_17_ITEM7_P29_S8	Going forward, we do not expect Motorola Mobility to account for greater than 10% of our net sales.
866374_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Gross profit Gross profit is affected by a number of factors, including the number and size of new manufacturing programs, product mix, component costs and availability, product life cycles, unit volumes, pricing, competition, new product introductions, capacity utilization and the expansion and consolidation of manufacturing facilities.
866374_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The flexible design of our manufacturing processes allows us to build a broad range of products in our facilities and better utilize our manufacturing capacity across our diverse geographic footprint.
866374_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	In the cases of new programs, profitability normally lags revenue growth due to product start-up costs, lower manufacturing program volumes in the start-up phase, operational inefficiencies, and under-absorbed overhead.
866374_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	Gross margin for these programs often improves over time as manufacturing volumes increase, as our utilization rates and overhead absorption improve, and as we increase the level of manufacturing services content.
866374_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	As a result of these various factors, our gross margin varies from period to period.
866374_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	Gross profit during fiscal year 2017 decreased $87.1 million to $1.5 billion from $1.6 billion during fiscal year 2016 primarily as a result of the $92.9 million, or 40 basis points, of charges recognized related to the significant decline in prices for solar modules and the slowdown in demand as previously discussed under our customer credit risk section, coupled with the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2017, to accelerate our ability to support more Sketch-to-Scale tm efforts across the Company.
866374_17_ITEM7_P31_S4	A portion of this decrease was offset by our strategic evolution and structural mix shift to higher margin end markets in our IEI and HRS segments while also providing greater levels of innovation, design and engineering services.
866374_17_ITEM7_P31_S5	Gross margin decreased 30 basis points, to 6.3% of net sales in fiscal year 2017 , from 6.6% of net sales in fiscal year 2016 , mainly attributable to the same factors previously described.
866374_17_ITEM7_P31_S6	Gross profit during fiscal year 2016 increased $62.7 million to $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion during fiscal year 2015 reflecting a richer mix of business and improved operational execution while ramping new customers and programs during fiscal year 2016.
866374_17_ITEM7_P31_S7	Gross margin increased to 6.6% of net sales in fiscal year 2016 as compared with 5.9% of net sales in fiscal year 2015.
866374_17_ITEM7_P31_S8	Gross margins improved 70 basis points in fiscal year 2016 compared to that of fiscal year 2015 due to proportionate increased share of our total revenue attributable to our HRS and IEI segments coupled with their increased profitability primarily driven by our acquisitions of Mirror Controls International ("MCi") and NEXTracker.
866374_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Segment income An operating segment's performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income.
866374_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Segment income is defined as net sales less cost of sales, and segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and other, distressed customer charges, other charges (income), net and interest and other, net.
866374_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	A portion of depreciation is allocated to the respective segment together with other general corporate research and development and administrative expenses.
866374_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	The following table sets forth segment income and margins:
866374_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Corporate and other primarily includes corporate services costs that are not included in the CODM's assessment of the performance of each of the identified reporting segments.
866374_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	(1) During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we initiated a restructuring plan to accelerate its ability to support more Sketch-to-Scale tm efforts across the Company and reposition away from historical legacy programs and structures through rationalizing its current footprint at existing sites and at corporate SG A functions.
866374_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	This charge is primarily for employee terminations costs, as described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as other asset impairments, and is split between cost of sales and selling, general and administration expenses on our consolidated statement of operations.
866374_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	This charge is excluded from the measurement of our operating segment's performance.
866374_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	CEC segment margin decreased 30 basis points to 2.7%, for fiscal year 2017 , from 3.0% during fiscal year 2016 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	The decrease was driven by lower capacity utilization causing reduced overhead absorption, pricing pressures coupled with incremental costs for proactive repositioning of certain programs and actions to better align CEC's operating structure.
866374_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	CEC segment margin increased 20 basis points, for fiscal year 2016 , from 2.8% during fiscal year 2015 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	The improvements were driven by a favorable product mix changes from new program offerings, higher utilization levels and strong operational execution across multiple customers and facilities, offset by incremental engineering spend as we continue to invest in expanding our capabilities in converged infrastructure.
866374_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	CTG segment margin increased 50 basis points to 2.8% for fiscal year 2017 , from 2.3% during fiscal year 2016 , primarily driven by a portfolio shift within the CTG product mix with a greater concentration of higher margin products where we provide greater levels of design and engineering value-added content, as well as exiting of lower margin businesses and the benefit from a better-than-expected execution on certain products which were going end of life.
866374_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	CTG segment margin slightly decreased 10 basis points for fiscal year 2016 , from 2.4% during fiscal year 2015 , due primarily to the soft macro economy, notably in Brazil, which impacted consumer business, partially offset by a portfolio shift within the CTG product mix focusing on higher margin consumer electronics products.
866374_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	IEI segment margin increased 20 basis points to 3.6% for fiscal year 2017 , from 3.4% during fiscal year 2016 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	This is primarily driven by new program ramps and demand increase in capital equipment and household industrial and lifestyle, partially offset by underperformance from the loss of SunEdison, which was formerly our largest IEI customer and relatedly, from sales of solar panel inventory acquired from SunEdison in 2016.
866374_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	IEI segment margin increased 40 basis points to 3.4% for fiscal year 2016 , from 3.0% during fiscal year 2015 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	This is primarily due to strong operational execution and higher utilization levels coupled with additional margin enhancement from our NEXTracker acquisition that contributed higher margins for the second half of fiscal year 2016.
866374_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	HRS segment margin increased 50 basis points to 8.1% for fiscal year 2017 , from 7.6% during fiscal year 2016 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	The improvements are primarily the result of new program launches and richer mix with greater value-added business engagements as a result of greater design and engineering solutions as part of our Sketch-to-Scale tm offering.
866374_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	HRS segment margin increased 120 basis points to 7.6% for fiscal year 2016 , from 6.4% for fiscal year 2015 primarily due to additional flow through from the increase in revenue from new programs and contribution from our MCi acquisition starting in our second quarter of fiscal year 2016.
866374_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	Additional margin was related to greater value-added business engagements resulting from an increase in design and engineering solutions as part of our Sketch-to-Scale tm offering.
866374_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Restructuring charges During fiscal year 2017, we initiated a restructuring plan to accelerate our ability to support more Sketch-to-Scale tm efforts across the Company and reposition away from historical legacy programs and structures through rationalizing our current footprint at existing sites including certain corporate SG A functions.
866374_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	We recognized $49.4 million of pre-tax restructuring charges predominantly for employee termination costs.
866374_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	The restructuring charges by geographic region were $28.5 million in the Americas, $15.1 million in Asia and $5.8 million in Europe.
866374_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	We classified $38.8 million of these charges as a component of cost of sales and $10.6 million as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.
866374_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	There were no material restructuring activities during fiscal years 2016 and 2015.
866374_17_ITEM7_P41_S5	As of March 31, 2017 the plan had been completed and the accrued costs relating to the restructuring charges were $23.5 million of which $23.5 million was classified as a current obligation.
866374_17_ITEM7_P41_S6	Refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") totaled $937.3 million or 3.9% of net sales, during fiscal year 2017 , compared to $954.9 million , or 3.9% of net sales, during fiscal year 2016 , decreasing by $17.6 million or 2% .
866374_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	The decrease in SG A in dollars is primarily the result of the nonrecurring $61.0 million bad debt reserve charge recognized in the prior year as explained below, offset by further investments in design and engineering resources by us to support our increased Sketch-to-Scale tm initiatives.
866374_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	We also incurred incremental costs associated with our targeted acquisitions and restructuring activities in fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	SG A totaled $954.9 million or 3.9% of net sales, during fiscal year 2016, compared to $844.5 million, or 3.2% of net sales, during fiscal year 2015, increasing by $110.4 million or 13%.
866374_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	The increase in SG A in dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily the result of an increase in costs associated with research, development and design activities, as we continued to deploy resources to meet the needs of our customers and explore new product innovations, increases in stock-based compensation expense, incremental costs associated with our acquisitions of MCi and NEXTracker both of which drive a higher proportional SG A level, and a bad debt reserve charge associated with our outstanding SunEdison receivables of $61.0 million as a result of SunEdison's bankruptcy filing.
866374_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	Intangible amortization Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal year 2017 increased by $15.4 million to $81.4 million from $66.0 million in fiscal year 2016 , primarily as a result of incremental amortization expense on intangibles assets relating to our acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2017 as well as those completed in the second half of fiscal year 2016.
866374_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal year 2016 increased by $33.9 million to $66.0 million from $32.0 million in fiscal year 2015, primarily as a result of incremental amortization expense on intangibles assets relating to our acquisitions completed during the fiscal year 2016.
866374_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	Other charges (income), net The fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 includes a $7.4 million loss attributable to a non-strategic facility sold during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM7_P43_S5	No other components of other charges and income, net incurred during fiscal year 2017 were material.
866374_17_ITEM7_P43_S6	During fiscal year 2016, we recognized other charges of $47.7 million primarily due to a $26.8 million loss on the disposition of a non-strategic Western European manufacturing facility which included a non cash foreign currency translation loss of $25.3 million, and $21.8 million from the impairment of a non-core investment.
866374_17_ITEM7_P43_S7	These were offset by a non-cash foreign currency translation gain of $4.2 million.
866374_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	During fiscal year 2015, we recognized other income of $53.2 million principally as a result of the reversal of a contractual obligation with a certain customer recognized during the fiscal year 2014 in the amount of $55.0 million.
866374_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	We executed an amendment to the customer contract during fiscal year 2015 which relieved us of the performance commitment as was defined in an existing customer manufacturing agreement.
866374_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	We also recognized an $11.0 million loss in connection with the disposition of a manufacturing facility in Western Europe.
866374_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	Further, we recognized a net gain for the sale of a certain investment, which primarily comprises the balance for other income in fiscal year 2015 net of the above items.
866374_17_ITEM7_P44_S4	Interest and other, net Interest and other, net was $99.5 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $84.8 million during fiscal year 2016 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P44_S5	The increase in interest and other, net of $14.7 million was primarily due to a $10.0 million increase of interest expense from the 4.750% Note due June 15, 2025 and the Term Loan due November 2021, as further discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, and a $7.9 million decrease in foreign exchange gains, offset by $8.0 million of acquisition-related costs incurred during fiscal year 2016 as described below.
866374_17_ITEM7_P44_S6	Interest and other, net was $84.8 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to $51.4 million during fiscal year 2015.
866374_17_ITEM7_P44_S7	The increase in interest and other, net of $33.4 million was primarily due to a $23.5 million increase of interest expense from the 4.750% Notes issued during the fiscal year 2016 as further discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as $8.0 million of acquisition-related costs incurred during fiscal year 2016, primarily for our acquisition of MCi.
866374_17_ITEM7_P44_S8	Interest and other, net was $51.4 million during fiscal year 2015 compared to $61.9 million during fiscal year 2014.
866374_17_ITEM7_P44_S9	The decrease in interest and other, net was primarily due to a gain associated with minority interest from an investment, an increase in foreign currency gains relating to the Chinese RMB, and a decrease in interest expense as a result of refinancing of certain debt facilities during the latter part of fiscal year 2014.
866374_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Income taxes The Company works to ensure it accrues and pays the appropriate amount of income taxes according to the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which it operates.
866374_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	Certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates.
866374_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	The consolidated effective tax rates were 13.8% , 2.3% and 10.4% for the fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	The effective rate varies from the Singapore statutory rate of 17.0% in each year as a result of the following items:
866374_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	The variation in our effective tax rate each year is primarily a result of recognition of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are taxed at rates lower than the Singapore statutory rate including the effect of tax holidays and tax incentives we received primarily for our subsidiaries in China, Malaysia and Israel of $15.5 million , $6.6 million and $9.8 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
866374_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	Additionally, our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $0.7 million , $(13.7) million , and $29.7 million and changes in our valuation allowances on deferred tax assets of $78.7 million , $1.0 million and $2.5 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
866374_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	We generate most of our revenues and profits from operations outside of Singapore.
866374_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examinations, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	We provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that in our estimation are not more likely than not to be realized.
866374_17_ITEM7_P47_S4	During fiscal year 2017, we released valuation allowances totaling $39.6 million primarily related to our operations in Austria, China, Ireland and Canada as these amounts were deemed to be more likely than not to be realized due to the sustained profitability during the past three fiscal years as well as continued forecasted profitability of those subsidiaries.
866374_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	valuation allowance eliminations were offset by other current period valuation allowance movements primarily related to current period valuation allowance additions due to increased deferred tax assets related to current period losses in legal entities with existing full valuation allowance positions.
866374_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	In addition, due to increased negative evidence during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, the Company added a valuation allowance of $14.4 million for a Chinese subsidiary which did not previously have a valuation allowance recorded.
866374_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	See note 13, "Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of March 31, 2017 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion and bank and other borrowings of $3.0 billion .
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	We have a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2017 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	As of March 31, 2017 , over half of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries outside of Singapore.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S4	Although substantially all of the amounts held outside of Singapore could be repatriated, under current laws, a significant amount could be subject to income tax withholdings.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S5	We provide for tax liabilities on these amounts for financial statement purposes, except for certain of our foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Singapore (approximately $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2017 ).
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S6	Repatriation could result in an additional income tax payment; however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of Singapore and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our operations in jurisdictions outside of where they are held.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S7	Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of Singapore and we would meet our liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S8	Fiscal Year 2017 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion during fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S9	This resulted primarily from $319.6 million of net income for the period plus $673.6 million of non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, other impairment charges, provision for doubtful accounts and stock-based compensation expense that are included in the determination of net income.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S10	Depreciation expense comprised $432.2 million of those non-cash charges, which was relatively consistent with our normal annual run rate of approximately $425 million .
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S11	We generated $156.7 million in cash as a result of changes in our operating assets and liabilities, driven primarily by a $268.7 million increase in accounts payable, offset by a $184.0 million increase in accounts receivable.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S12	Net working capital ("NWC"), defined as net accounts receivable, including deferred purchase price receivables, plus inventory less accounts payable decreased by $189.5 million primarily due to an increase in accounts payables and reduction in our inventory.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S13	Cash used in investing activities was $0.7 billion during fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S14	This resulted primarily from $489.5 million of net capital expenditures for property and equipment to expand capability and capacity in support of our automotive and medical businesses and further investments in both automation and expanding technologies to support our innovation services.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S15	We also paid $189.1 million for the acquisition of four businesses, net of cash acquired, including $161.7 million , net of $18.0 million of cash acquired related to the acquisition of manufacturing facilities from Bose.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S16	Further, $60.0 million was paid for a non-controlling interest in a joint venture with RIB Software AG as our partner.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S17	Offsetting this was proceeds from various other investing activities of $63.5 million, most notably the receipt of $36.7 million for the sale of two non-strategic businesses.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S18	Cash used in financing activities was $242.1 million during fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S19	This was primarily for the repurchase of ordinary shares in the amount $349.5 million , and $31.4 million of cash paid to a third party banking institution for certain assets that were financed by the third party banking institution on behalf of a customer, which is included in other financing activities, as further discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S20	These cash outflows were partially offset by $171.0 million of net proceeds from bank borrowings and long-term debt, of which $130.0 million is the incremental amount borrowed extending the maturity date of one of our loan agreements from August 30, 2018 to November 30, 2021, and $107.4 million is the amount of proceeds from the 100 million term loan, discussed further in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S21	Fiscal Year 2016 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion during fiscal year 2016.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S22	This resulted primarily from $444.1 million of net income for the period plus $625.4 million of non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, other impairment charges, provision for doubtful accounts and stock-based compensation expense that are included in the determination of net income.
866374_17_ITEM7_P49_S23	Depreciation expense comprised $425.7 million of those non-cash charges, which was relatively consistent with our normal annual run rate of approximately $425.0 million.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	changes in our operating assets and liabilities, driven primarily by a $423.6 million reduction in accounts receivable due to improved collection efforts and lower business levels, offset by a $365.1 million reduction in accounts payable.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Net working capital, defined as net accounts receivable, including deferred purchase price receivables, plus inventory less accounts payable decreased by $37.7 million primarily due to lower business levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as compared to the same quarter of fiscal year 2015, which resulted in slightly lower levels of investments in NWC.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	Cash used in investing activities was $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2016.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	This resulted primarily from $916.5 million for the acquisition of eleven businesses completed during fiscal year 2016, including approximately $555.2 million, net of cash acquired, related to the acquisition of MCi, $240.8 million, net of cash acquired, related to the acquisition of NEXTracker, and approximately $67.5 million to acquire an optical transport facility from Alcatel-Lucent.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S4	We also paid $510.6 million in gross capital expenditures for property and equipment to support certain programs, offset by $13.7 million of proceeds from the sale of certain buildings and machinery and equipment.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S5	Other investing activities also includes $44.7 million paid for the purchase of certain investments, offset by $54.3 million of proceeds from the sale of certain assets that were purchased on behalf of a customer and financed by a third party banking institution, as further discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S6	Cash provided by financing activities was $249.6 million during fiscal year 2016, which was primarily the result of net proceeds from bank borrowings and long-term debt of $694.5 million mainly resulting from our new debt issuance discussed further in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, and $61.3 million from the issuance of our shares for option exercises.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S7	These cash inflows were partially offset by $420.3 million of cash paid for the repurchase of our ordinary shares, and $75.8 million of cash paid to a third party banking institution for certain assets that were financed by the third party banking institution on behalf of a customer, which is included in other financing activities.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S8	Fiscal Year 2015 Cash provided by operating activities was $794.0 million during fiscal year 2015.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S9	This resulted primarily from $600.8 million of net income for the period plus $510.9 million of non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, other impairment charges and stock-based compensation expense that are included in the determination of net income.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S10	Depreciation expense comprised $496.8 million of those non-cash charges, which was higher than our normal annual run rate of approximately $425.0 million due to accelerated depreciation recognized for fixed assets directly associated with certain product exits during the year.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S11	These were offset by $317.6 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities, driven primarily by a $565.1 million reduction in customer deposits that were received in prior periods to support increased working capital requirements in those periods.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S12	NWC decreased by $212.5 million primarily due to lower business levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as compared to the same quarter of fiscal year 2014, which resulted in lower levels of investments in NWC.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S13	Cash used in investing activities amounted to $242.2 million during fiscal year 2015.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S14	This resulted primarily from $347.4 million in gross capital expenditures for property and equipment to support certain programs, offset by $107.7 million of proceeds from the sale of certain buildings and machinery and equipment.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S15	We also paid $52.7 million for the acquisition of four businesses completed during fiscal year 2015.
866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S16	Other investing activities also includes $79.7 million of proceeds from the sale of manufacturing equipment originally purchased on behalf of a customer and financed by a third party banking institution, partially offset by $15.7 million paid for the purchase of certain technology rights.

866374_17_ITEM7_P50_S19	The aforementioned cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of our shares for option exercises amounting to $23.5 million.
866374_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Key Liquidity Metrics Free Cash flow We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repurchase company shares, fund acquisitions, make investments, repay debt obligations, and for certain other activities.
866374_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	Our free cash flow, which is calculated as cash provided by operations less net purchases of property and equipment, was $660.4 million , $639.5 million and $554.3 million for fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.
866374_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities.
866374_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Free cash flows reconcile to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of cash flows from operations as follows:
866374_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Days in trade accounts receivable was calculated as average accounts receivable for the current and prior quarter, adding back the reduction in accounts receivable for the deferred purchase price received in exchange for sales of accounts receivable under our global asset backed securitization programs, divided by annualized sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 , days in trade accounts receivable decreased by 2 days to 43 days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 primarily due to better experience in collections.
866374_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	Deferred purchase price receivables included for the purposes of the calculation were $506.5 million , $501.1 million and $600.7 million for the years ended March 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and are recorded in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
866374_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	Days in inventory was calculated as average inventory for the current and prior quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_17_ITEM7_P55_S4	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 , days in inventory decreased by 1 day to 58 days as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P55_S5	The decrease was primarily the result of improved inventory management.
866374_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Days in accounts payable was calculated as average accounts payable for the current and prior quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the current quarter by day.
866374_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 , days in accounts payable remained consistent at 77 days compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 .
866374_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	Our cash conversion cycle was calculated as days in trade receivables plus days in inventory, minus days in accounts payable and is a measure of how efficient we are at managing our working capital.
866374_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	Our cash conversion cycle decreased by 3 days for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to that of fiscal year 2016 due to the factors affecting each of the components in the calculation discussed above.
866374_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets.
866374_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world.
866374_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances; however, any current restrictions are not material.
866374_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout the global organization.
866374_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	We believe that our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months.
866374_17_ITEM7_P58_S4	Future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, the timing of capital expenditures for new equipment, the extent to which we utilize operating leases for new facilities and equipment, and the levels of shipments and changes in the volumes of customer orders.
866374_17_ITEM7_P58_S5	We are also consciously elevating the levels of spend to support our new business models and investing across all aspects of our platform as we continue our shift to a Sketch-to-Scale tm portfolio.
866374_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	In April 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of AGM Automotive for approximately $220 million , which expanded its capabilities in the automotive market, and is included within the HRS segment.
866374_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Historically, we have funded operations from cash and cash equivalents generated from operations, proceeds from public offerings of equity and debt securities, bank debt and lease financings.
866374_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	We also sell a designated pool of trade receivables under asset-backed securitization ("ABS") programs and sell certain trade receivables, which are in addition to the trade receivables sold in connection with these securitization agreements.
866374_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	During fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 we received approximately $5.7 billion , $5.2 billion and $4.3 billion , respectively from sales of receivables under our ABS programs, and $1.3 billion , $2.3 billion and $4.2 billion , respectively from other sales of receivables.
866374_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	As of March 31, 2017 and 2016 , the outstanding balance on receivables sold for cash was $1.2 billion , for each year, under all our accounts receivable sales programs, which are removed from accounts receivable balances in our consolidated balance sheets.
866374_17_ITEM7_P60_S4	We anticipate that we will enter into debt and equity financings, sales of accounts receivable and lease transactions to fund acquisitions and anticipated growth.
866374_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	The sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current shareholders.
866374_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	Further, we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations and could increase debt service obligations.
866374_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	This increased indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, potentially affect our credit ratings, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_17_ITEM7_P61_S3	Any downgrades in credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow as a result of more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_17_ITEM7_P61_S4	We continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase ordinary shares.
866374_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Historically we have been successful in refinancing and extending the maturity dates on our term loans and credit facilities.
866374_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	In November 2016, we entered into a new arrangement to extend the maturity date of a term loan agreement from August 2018 to November 2021, and borrowed an incremental amount of $130 million under the term loan, thereby increasing the total amount under the term loan to $700 million.
866374_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	In January 2017, we borrowed 100 million (approximately $107.4 million as of March 31, 2017), under a 5-year, term-loan agreement due January 2022.

866374_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions and highly rated money market accounts.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Our investment policy has strict guidelines focusing on preservation of capital.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The portfolio is comprised of various instruments including term deposits with banks, marketable securities and money market accounts.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our cash is principally invested in the U.S. dollar and China RMB serving as a natural hedge of our RMB denominated costs.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of March 31, 2017 , the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was $1.1 billion , the largest components of which were USD and RMB denominated money market accounts with an average return of 1.74% .
866374_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We had variable rate debt outstanding of approximately $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2017 .
866374_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Variable rate debt obligations consisted of borrowings under our term loans.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Interest on these obligations is discussed above.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our variable rate debt instruments create exposures for us related to interest rate risk.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Primarily due to the current low interest rates a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As of March 31, 2017 , the approximate average fair value of our debt outstanding under our term loan facilities that matures in March 2019 and November 2021, and Notes due February 2020, February 2023 and June 2025 was 103.4% of the face value of the debt obligations based on broker trading prices.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	We have established a foreign currency risk management policy to manage this risk.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	To the extent possible, we manage our foreign currency exposure by evaluating and using non-financial techniques, such as currency of invoice, leading and lagging payments and receivables management.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P6_S3	In addition, we may borrow in various foreign currencies and enter into short-term foreign currency forward, swap, and option contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities, mainly accounts receivable and accounts payable, and cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P6_S4	We endeavor to maintain a partial or fully hedged position for certain transaction exposures.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P6_S5	These exposures are primarily, but not limited to, revenues, customer and vendor payments and inter-company balances in currencies other than the functional currency unit of the operating entity.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P6_S6	The credit risk of our foreign currency forward and swap contracts is minimized since all contracts are with large financial institutions and accordingly, fair value adjustments related to the credit risk of the counter-party financial institution were not material.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The gains and losses on forward and swap contracts generally offset the losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and transactions hedged.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The fair value of currency forward and swap contracts is reported on the balance sheet.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts as of March 31, 2017 amounted to $4.1 billion and the recorded fair values of the associated assets and liabilities were not material.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The majority of these foreign exchange contracts expire in less than three months and all expire within one year.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P8_S1	They will settle primarily in Brazilian real, British pound, China renminbi, Danish krone, the Euro, Hungarian forint, Israeli shekel, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar.
866374_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Based on our overall currency rate exposures as of March 31, 2017 , including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and cash flows, a near-term 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar from its cross-functional rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Flex Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2017.

866374_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	Recoverability of property and equipment is determined by comparing its carrying amount to the lowest level of identifiable projected undiscounted cash flows the property and equipment are expected to generate.
866374_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of property and equipment exceeds its fair value.
866374_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Deferred Income Taxes The Company provides for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
866374_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities by applying the applicable statutory tax rate to such differences.
866374_17_ITEM8_P33_S2	Additionally, the Company assesses whether each income tax position is "more likely than not" of being sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation, if any.
866374_17_ITEM8_P33_S3	For each income tax position that meets the "more likely than not" recognition threshold, the Company would then assess the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon effective settlement with the tax authority.
866374_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company has actively pursued business and asset acquisitions, which are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
866374_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	The fair value of the net assets acquired and the results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the acquisition dates forward.
866374_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and results of operations during the reporting period.
866374_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, the fair value of acquired net operating assets, property and equipment, intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities, useful lives of plant and equipment and amortizable lives for acquired intangible assets.
866374_17_ITEM8_P35_S2	Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identified assets and liabilities acquired is recognized as goodwill.
866374_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company estimates the preliminary fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition based on information available at that time.
866374_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the date of the acquisition with subsequent adjustments recorded in earnings.
866374_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	Changes to valuation allowances on acquired deferred tax assets are recognized in the provision for, or benefit from, income taxes.
866374_17_ITEM8_P36_S3	The valuation of these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities is subject to further management review and may change materially between the preliminary allocation and end of the purchase price allocation period.
866374_17_ITEM8_P36_S4	Any changes in these estimates may have a material effect on the Company's consolidated operating results or financial position.
866374_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
866374_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors, market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis.
866374_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	If the recorded value of the assets, including goodwill, and liabilities ("net book value") of each reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss may be required to be recognized.
866374_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	Further, to the extent the net book value of the Company as a whole is greater than its fair value in the aggregate, all, or a significant portion of its goodwill may be considered impaired.
866374_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company has four reporting units, which correspond to its four reportable operating segments: HRS, CTG, IEI and CEC.
866374_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Company concluded that there was no change to its reporting units in fiscal year 2017 and performed its goodwill impairment assessment on January 1, 2017 .
866374_17_ITEM8_P39_S2	In lieu of the qualitative "Step Zero" assessment, the Company performed a quantitative assessment of its goodwill and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test because the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
866374_17_ITEM8_P39_S3	The following table summarizes the activity in the Company's goodwill during fiscal years 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):
866374_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	(1) The goodwill generated from the Company's business combinations completed during the fiscal years 2017 and 2016 are primarily related to value placed on the employee workforce, service offerings and capabilities and expected synergies.
866374_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.
866374_17_ITEM8_P40_S2	Refer to the discussion of the Company's business acquisitions in note 17.
866374_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	(2) During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, the Company disposed of two non-strategic businesses within the IEI and HRS segments, and recorded an aggregate reduction of goodwill of $4.4 million accordingly, which is included in the loss on sale recorded in other charges, net on the consolidated statement of operations.
866374_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	(3) Includes adjustments based on management's estimates resulting from their review and finalization of the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired through certain business combinations completed in a period subsequent to the respective acquisition.
866374_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	These adjustments were not individually, nor in the aggregate, significant to the Company.
866374_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	(4) During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $17.4 million and $5.5 million , respectively, of foreign currency translation adjustments primarily related to the goodwill associated with the acquisition of Mirror Controls International ("MCi") in fiscal year 2016, as the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against the Euro.
866374_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company's acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset may not be recoverable.
866374_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
866374_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company reviewed the carrying value of its intangible assets as of March 31, 2017 and concluded that such amounts continued to be recoverable.
866374_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Intangible assets are comprised of customer-related intangible assets, that include contractual agreements and customer relationships; and licenses and other intangible assets, that are primarily comprised of licenses and also includes patents and trademarks, and developed technologies.
866374_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	Generally, both customer-related intangible assets and licenses and other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis, over a period of up to ten years.
866374_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	No residual value is estimated for any intangible assets.
866374_17_ITEM8_P45_S3	The fair value of the Company's intangible assets purchased through business combinations is determined based on management's estimates of cash flow and recoverability.
866374_17_ITEM8_P45_S4	The components of acquired intangible assets are as follows:
866374_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	The gross carrying amounts of intangible assets are removed when fully amortized.
866374_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	During fiscal year 2017 , the gross carrying amounts of fully amortized intangible assets totaled $14.2 million .
866374_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	During fiscal year 2017, the gross carrying amount of intangible assets increased primarily in connection with the Company's acquisitions during the year.
866374_17_ITEM8_P46_S3	Total intangible asset amortization expense recognized in operations during fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $81.4 million , $66.0 million and $32.0 million , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM8_P46_S4	As of March 31, 2017 , the weighted-average remaining useful lives of the Company's intangible assets were approximately 6.6 years for both customer-related intangibles and licenses and other intangible assets.
866374_17_ITEM8_P46_S5	The estimated future annual amortization expense for acquired intangible assets is as follows:
866374_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	All derivative instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
866374_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	If the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, effectiveness is tested monthly using a regression analysis of the change in spot currency rates and the change in present value of the spot currency rates.
866374_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	The spot currency rates are discounted to present value using functional currency Inter-bank Offering Rates over the maximum length of the hedge period.
866374_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument (excluding time value) is recognized in shareholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the hedged item affects earnings.
866374_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	If the derivative instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period.
866374_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	Additional information is included in note 8.
866374_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	Other Current Assets Other current assets include approximately $506.5 million and $501.1 million as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively for the deferred purchase price receivable from the Company's Global and North American Asset-Backed Securitization programs.
866374_17_ITEM8_P50_S3	See note 10 for additional information.
866374_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	In connection with a prior acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement with a customer and a third party banking institution to procure certain manufacturing equipment that was financed by the third party banking institution, acting as an agent of the customer.
866374_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	The manufacturing equipment was used exclusively for the benefit of this customer.
866374_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	During fiscal year 2015, the Company ceased manufacturing of the product related to the financed equipment.
866374_17_ITEM8_P51_S3	As a result, pursuant to an agreement with the customer the Company as an agent on behalf of the customer dispositioned the equipment via sales to third parties and used the proceeds to reduce the obligation to the third party banking institution.
866374_17_ITEM8_P51_S4	Accordingly, the residual value due from the customer related to the equipment financed by the third party banking institution was $83.6 million as of March 31, 2016, and was included in other current assets.
866374_17_ITEM8_P51_S5	During fiscal year 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with the third party banking institution and the customer granted a waiver of any amounts owed under the financing arrangement which allowed for a net settlement of the related asset and liability.
866374_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	Investments The Company has certain equity investments in, and notes receivable from, non-publicly traded companies which are included within other assets.
866374_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	The equity method of accounting is used when the Company has the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer; otherwise the cost method is used.
866374_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	Non-majority-owned investments in corporations are accounted for using the equity method when the Company has an ownership percentage equal to or generally greater than 20% but less than 50% , and for non-majority-owned investments in partnerships when generally greater than 5% .
866374_17_ITEM8_P52_S3	The Company monitors these investments for impairment indicators and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values as required.
866374_17_ITEM8_P52_S4	Fair values of these investments, when required, are estimated using unobservable inputs, primarily comparable company multiples and discounted cash flow projections.
866374_17_ITEM8_P52_S5	As of March 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Company's equity investments in non-majority owned companies totaled $200.1 million and $122.9 million , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM8_P52_S6	The equity in the earnings or losses of the Company's equity method investments was not material to the consolidated results of operations for any period presented and is included in interest and other, net.
866374_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	During fiscal year 2017, the Company formed a joint venture with RIB Software AG, a provider of technology for the construction industry.
866374_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	This joint venture will offer a fully integrated enterprise software platform for building and housing projects.
866374_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	The Company contributed $60.0 million for a non-controlling interest in this joint venture.
866374_17_ITEM8_P53_S3	This contribution, net of the Company's equity in losses, which is immaterial, is included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
866374_17_ITEM8_P53_S4	The cash outflows to pay for this investment have been included in cash flows from other investing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
866374_17_ITEM8_P53_S5	Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities include customer working capital advances of $231.3 million and $253.7 million , customer-related accruals of $501.9 million and $479.5 million , and deferred revenue of $280.7 million and $332.3 million as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM8_P53_S6	The customer working capital advances are not interest bearing, do not have fixed repayment dates and are generally reduced as the underlying working capital is consumed in production.
866374_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	As of March 31, 2016, other current liabilities also included the outstanding balances due to the third party banking institution related to the financed equipment discussed above of $122.0 million .
866374_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	As discussed above, during fiscal year 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with the third party banking institution and the customer granted a waiver of any amounts owed under the financing arrangement which provided for a net settlement of the outstanding balance of approximately $90.6 million with the related asset.
866374_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company recognizes restructuring charges related to its plans to close or consolidate excess manufacturing facilities and rationalize administrative functions.
866374_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	In connection with these activities, the Company records restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other exit-related costs.
866374_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	The recognition of restructuring charges requires the Company to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity.
866374_17_ITEM8_P55_S3	To the extent the Company's actual results differ from its estimates and assumptions, the Company may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_17_ITEM8_P55_S4	Such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_17_ITEM8_P55_S5	At the end of each reporting period, the Company evaluates the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_17_ITEM8_P55_S6	See note 14 for additional information regarding restructuring charges.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the accounting for share-based payments.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	The new guidance simplifies various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments including income tax effects, withholding requirements and forfeitures.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	The Company elected to early adopt this new guidance beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S3	The guidance eliminates additional paid in capital ("APIC") pools and requires companies to recognize all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S4	It also addresses the presentation of excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S5	Prior to adoption, the Company elected to not deduct tax benefits for stock-based compensation awards on its tax returns, and accordingly, did not have any excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies upon adoption.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S6	The Company therefore determined that adoption of the new guidance had no impact on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S7	Further, the new guidance eliminates the requirement to estimate forfeitures and reduce stock compensation expense during the vesting period.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S8	Instead, companies can elect to account for actual forfeitures as they occur and record any previously unrecognized compensation expense for estimated forfeitures up to the period of adoption as a retrospective adjustment to beginning retained earnings.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S9	The Company has made the election to account for actual forfeitures as they occur starting in fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S10	After assessment, it was determined that the cumulative effect adjustment required under the new guidance was immaterial and therefore the Company did not record a retrospective adjustment.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S11	The Company finally determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S12	In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S13	This guidance requires that the change be applied on a prospective basis, and it is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early application permitted.
866374_17_ITEM8_P56_S14	The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance and the timing of adoption.
866374_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that changes the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business.
866374_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	This guidance requires that the amendments be applied on a prospective basis, and it is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, with early application permitted.
866374_17_ITEM8_P57_S2	The guidance may result in more asset acquisitions being accounted for as purchases of assets in lieu of business combinations.
866374_17_ITEM8_P57_S3	The Company intends to adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
866374_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to amend the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity ("VIE") should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE.
866374_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	This guidance requires that the amendments be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis, and it is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted.
866374_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	The Company expects the new guidance will have an immaterial impact on its consolidated financial statements, and it intends to adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
866374_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance intended to address specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
866374_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	year 2019, with early application permitted.
866374_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	The new guidance allows for two transition methods in application - (i) retrospective to each period presented, or (ii) if it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, then the amendments for those issues would be applied prospective as of the earliest date practicable.
866374_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company expects an immaterial impact on its consolidated financial statements.
866374_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	The Company is currently assessing the timing of adoption.
866374_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance intended to improve financial reporting on leasing transactions.
866374_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	The new lease guidance will require entities that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.
866374_17_ITEM8_P62_S2	The guidance will also enhance existing disclosure requirements relating to those leases.
866374_17_ITEM8_P62_S3	The Company will be required to adopt the new lease guidance beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted.
866374_17_ITEM8_P62_S4	Upon initial evaluation, the Company believes the new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheets when adopted.
866374_17_ITEM8_P62_S5	The Company is currently assessing the timing of adoption.
866374_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the measurement of inventory, by requiring that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
866374_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market.
866374_17_ITEM8_P63_S2	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and should be applied prospectively with early application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
866374_17_ITEM8_P63_S3	The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update and the timing of adoption.
866374_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance which requires an entity to recognize revenue relating to contracts with customers that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
866374_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	In order to meet this requirement, the entity must apply the following steps: (i) identify the contracts with the customers; (ii) identify performance obligations in the contracts; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations per the contracts; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
866374_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	Additionally, disclosures required for revenue recognition will include qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
866374_17_ITEM8_P64_S3	The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
866374_17_ITEM8_P64_S4	The Company has assessed that the impact of the new guidance will result in a change of the Company's revenue recognition model for electronics manufacturing services from "point in time" upon physical delivery to an "over time" model and believes this transition will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption primarily as it recognizes an increase in contract assets for unbilled receivables with a corresponding reduction in finished goods and work-in-progress inventory.
866374_17_ITEM8_P64_S5	The Company has commenced implementation in accordance with the planned effective date.
866374_17_ITEM8_P64_S6	The new guidance allows for two transition methods in application - (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented, or (ii) prospective with the cumulative effect of adoption recognized on April 1, 2018, the first day of the Company's fiscal year 2019.
866374_17_ITEM8_P64_S7	The Company has not yet concluded upon its selection of the transition method.
866374_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Equity Compensation Plans The Company's primary plan used for granting equity compensation awards is the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan").
866374_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	During fiscal year 2016, in conjunction with the acquisition of NEXTracker, the Company assumed all of the outstanding, unvested share bonus awards and outstanding, unvested options to purchase shares of common stock of NEXTracker, and converted all these shares into Flex awards.
866374_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	As a result, the Company now offers the 2014 NEXTracker Equity Incentive Plan (the "NEXTracker Plan").
866374_17_ITEM8_P65_S3	Additionally, during fiscal year 2017, in conjunction with an immaterial acquisition, the Company assumed all of the outstanding, unvested options to purchase shares of common stock of the acquiree, and converted all of these shares into Flex awards.
866374_17_ITEM8_P65_S4	As a result, the Company now offers an additional equity compensation plan, the BrightBox Technologies 2013 Plan (the "BrightBox Plan").
866374_17_ITEM8_P65_S5	Further, during fiscal year 2017, the Company granted equity compensation awards under a fourth plan, the 2013 Elementum Plan (the "Elementum Plan"), which is administered by Elementum SCM (Cayman) Limited ("Elementum"), a majority owned subsidiary of the Company.
866374_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	Share-Based Compensation Expense The Company early adopted new guidance intended to reduce cost and complexity of the accounting for share-based payments, as discussed further in note 2.
866374_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense for all Equity Incentive Plans:
866374_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	Cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits (tax benefits related to the excess of proceeds from employee exercises of share options over the share-based compensation cost recognized for those options) are classified as operating cash flows.
866374_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	During fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company did not recognize any excess tax benefits as an operating cash inflow.
866374_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	The 2010 Equity Incentive Plan As of March 31, 2017 , the Company had approximately 18.1 million shares available for grant under the 2010 Plan.
866374_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	Options issued to employees under the 2010 Plan generally vest over four years and expire seven years from the date of grant.
866374_17_ITEM8_P68_S2	Options granted to non-employee directors expire five years from the date of grant.
866374_17_ITEM8_P68_S3	The exercise price of options granted to employees is determined by the Company's Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and may not be less than the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant.
866374_17_ITEM8_P68_S4	As of March 31, 2017 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share options granted to employees under the 2010 Plan was not significant and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years.
866374_17_ITEM8_P68_S5	The Company also grants share bonus awards under its equity compensation plan.
866374_17_ITEM8_P68_S6	Share bonus awards are rights to acquire a specified number of ordinary shares for no cash consideration in exchange for continued service with the Company.
866374_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Share bonus awards generally vest in installments over a three to five -year period and unvested share bonus awards are forfeited upon termination of employment.
866374_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	Vesting for certain share bonus awards is contingent upon both service and market conditions.
866374_17_ITEM8_P69_S2	Further, vesting for certain share bonus awards granted to certain executive officers is contingent upon meeting certain free cash flow targets.
866374_17_ITEM8_P69_S3	As of March 31, 2017 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share bonus awards granted to employees was approximately $130.0 million under the 2010 Plan.
866374_17_ITEM8_P69_S4	These costs will be amortized generally on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.
866374_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	Approximately $14.4 million of the unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2010 Plan is related to share bonus awards granted to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting a certain market condition.
866374_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	Determining Fair Value - Options and share bonus awards Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share options granted under the 2010 Plan using the Black-Scholes valuation method and a single option award approach.
866374_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
866374_17_ITEM8_P71_S2	The fair market value of share bonus awards granted, other than those awards with a market condition, is the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant and is generally recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.
866374_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	Expected Term The Company's expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation method represents the period that the Company's share options are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share options, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its share options.
866374_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	Expected Volatility The Company's expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes valuation method is derived from a combination of implied volatility related to publicly traded options to purchase Flex ordinary shares and historical variability in the Company's periodic share price.
866374_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	Expected Dividend The Company has never paid dividends on its ordinary shares and accordingly the dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.
866374_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities issued with a term equivalent to the expected term of the option.
866374_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	There were no options granted under the 2010 Plan during fiscal years 2017 and 2016.
866374_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	The fair value of the Company's share options granted to employees for fiscal year 2015 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Determining Fair Value - Share bonus awards with service and market conditions Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share bonus awards granted under the 2010 Plan whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions using Monte Carlo simulation.
866374_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is the service period.
866374_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	Expected volatility of Flex Volatility used in a Monte Carlo simulation is derived from the historical volatility of Flex's stock price over a period equal to the service period of the share bonus awards granted.
866374_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	The service period is three years for those share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
866374_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	Average peer volatility Volatility used in a Monte Carlo simulation is derived from the historical volatilities of both the Standard and Poor's ("S P") 500 index and components of an extended Electronics Manufacturing Services ("EMS") group, comprised of global competitors of the Company within the same industry, for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
866374_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	Average Peer Correlation Correlation coefficients were used to model the movement of Flex's stock price relative to both the S P 500 index and peers in the extended EMS group for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
866374_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	Expected Dividend and Risk-Free Interest Rate assumptions Same methodology as discussed above.
866374_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	The fair value of the Company's share-bonus awards under the 2010 Plan, whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions, for fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:

866374_17_ITEM8_P121_S2	These programs allow the operating subsidiaries to receive a cash payment and a deferred purchase price receivable for sold receivables.
866374_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	entities, the transferred receivables are isolated from the Company and its affiliates, and upon the sale of the receivables from the special purpose entities to the unaffiliated financial institutions effective control of the transferred receivables is passed to the unaffiliated financial institutions, which has the right to pledge or sell the receivables.
866374_17_ITEM8_P122_S1	Although the special purpose entities are consolidated by the Company, they are separate corporate entities and their assets are available first to satisfy the claims of their creditors.
866374_17_ITEM8_P122_S2	The investment limits set by the financial institutions are $850.0 million for the Global Program, of which $750.0 million is committed and $100.0 million is uncommitted, and $250.0 million for the North American Program, of which $210.0 million is committed and $40.0 million is uncommitted.
866374_17_ITEM8_P122_S3	Both programs require a minimum level of deferred purchase price receivable to be retained by the Company in connection with the sales.
866374_17_ITEM8_P122_S4	The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the special purpose entities and receives a servicing fee of 0.1% to 0.5% of serviced receivables per annum.
866374_17_ITEM8_P122_S5	Servicing fees recognized during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were not material and are included in interest and other, net within the consolidated statements of operations.
866374_17_ITEM8_P122_S6	As the Company estimates the fee it receives in return for its obligation to service these receivables is at fair value, no servicing assets or liabilities are recognized.
866374_17_ITEM8_P122_S7	As of March 31, 2017 and 2016 , the accounts receivable balances that were sold under the ABS Programs were removed from the consolidated balance sheets and the net cash proceeds received by the Company during fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were included as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

866374_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
866374_17_ITEM8_P126_S1	When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact, and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
866374_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	The accounting guidance for fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.
866374_17_ITEM8_P127_S1	A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
866374_17_ITEM8_P127_S2	The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
866374_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	Level 1 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
866374_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	The Company has deferred compensation plans for its officers and certain other employees.
866374_17_ITEM8_P129_S1	Amounts deferred under the plans are invested in hypothetical investments selected by the participant or the participant's investment manager.
866374_17_ITEM8_P129_S2	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets are included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets and include investments in equity securities that are valued using active market prices.
866374_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	Level 2 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets) such as cash and cash equivalents and money market funds; or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
866374_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	The Company values foreign exchange forward contracts using level 2 observable inputs which primarily consist of an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
866374_17_ITEM8_P131_S1	The Company's cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits and money market funds, which are valued using level 2 inputs, such as interest rates and maturity periods.
866374_17_ITEM8_P131_S2	Due to their short-term nature, their carrying amount approximates fair value.
866374_17_ITEM8_P131_S3	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets also include money market funds, mutual funds, corporate and government bonds and certain convertible securities that are valued using prices obtained from various pricing sources.
866374_17_ITEM8_P131_S4	These sources price these investments using certain market indices and the performance of these investments in relation to these indices.
866374_17_ITEM8_P131_S5	As a result, the Company has classified these investments as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
866374_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	Level 3 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
866374_17_ITEM8_P132_S1	The Company has accrued for contingent consideration in connection with its business acquisitions as applicable, which is measured at fair value based on certain internal models and unobservable inputs.
866374_17_ITEM8_P132_S2	During fiscal year 2016, the Company accrued $84.3 million of contingent consideration, of which $81.0 million related to the acquisition of NEXTracker on the date of acquisition.
866374_17_ITEM8_P132_S3	The Company reduced the accrual by $19.0 million for a contractual release from the obligation executed subsequent to the acquisition during fiscal year 2016.
866374_17_ITEM8_P132_S4	Upon achievement of targets established in the NEXTracker purchase agreement, the Company paid $40.6 million of the total contingent consideration during fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM8_P132_S5	This payment is included in other financing activities, net, in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
866374_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	The fair value of the liability was estimated using a simulation-based measurement technique with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a level 3 fair value measurement.
866374_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	obligation, and calculated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.
866374_17_ITEM8_P134_S1	Significant decreases in expected revenue during the earn-out period, or significant increases in the discount rate or volatility in isolation would result in lower fair value estimates.
866374_17_ITEM8_P134_S2	The interrelationship between these inputs is not considered significant.
866374_17_ITEM8_P134_S3	The following table summarizes the activities related to contingent consideration:
866374_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	The Company values deferred purchase price receivables relating to its Asset-Backed Securitization Program based on a discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable inputs (i.e. level 3 inputs), which are primarily risk free interest rates adjusted for the credit quality of the underlying creditor.
866374_17_ITEM8_P135_S1	Due to its high credit quality and short term maturity, their fair value approximates carrying value.
866374_17_ITEM8_P135_S2	Significant increases in either of the significant unobservable inputs (credit spread or risk free interest rate) in isolation would result in lower fair value estimates, however the impact is insignificant.
866374_17_ITEM8_P135_S3	The interrelationship between these inputs is also insignificant.
866374_17_ITEM8_P135_S4	Refer to note 10 for a reconciliation of the change in the deferred purchase price receivable.
866374_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy during fiscal years 2017 and 2016 .

866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S1	Further, the Company believes that it continues to have a number of affirmative and direct defenses to any potential claims for recovery and intends to vigorously defend any such claim, if asserted.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S2	An unfavorable resolution of this matter could be material to the Company s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S3	One of the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries has received related assessments for certain sales and import taxes.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S4	The first two tax assessments were received in fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2016 relating to calendar year 2010 for an alleged total amount of 109 million Brazilian reals (approximately USD $35 million based on the exchange rate as of March 31, 2017).
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S5	These two assessments are in various stages of the review process at the administrative level.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S6	During the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, the same Brazilian subsidiary received a third assessment related to calendar year 2011 taxes of an additional 181 million Brazilian reals (approximately USD $58 million based on the exchange rate as of March 31, 2017).
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S7	The Company plans to continue to vigorously oppose all of these assessments, as well as any future assessments.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S8	The Company believes there is no legal basis for the alleged liabilities; however, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the administrative review and judicial processes in Brazil and the nature of the claims, an adverse determination is reasonably possible.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S9	Due to the same considerations, it is not possible to estimate a loss or range of loss for these assessments or any future assessments that are reasonably possible.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S10	The Company does not expect final judicial determination on any of these claims for several years.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S11	During fiscal year 2015, one of the Company's non-operating Brazilian subsidiaries received an assessment of approximately USD $100 million related to income and social contribution taxes, interest and penalties.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S12	During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company received a final favorable judgment in the judicial process reversing the assessment and the case is now closed.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S13	As the Company had previously determined there was no legal basis for the assessment, no adjustment was required to be recorded during fiscal year 2017.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S14	In addition, from time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S15	The Company defends itself vigorously against any such claims.
866374_17_ITEM8_P144_S16	Although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management expects that any losses that are probable or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of these matters, which are in excess of amounts already accrued in the Company s consolidated balance sheets, would not be material to the financial statements as a whole.
866374_17_ITEM8_P145_S0	The domestic (Singapore) and foreign components of income before income taxes were comprised of the following:
866374_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	The provision for income taxes consisted of the following:
866374_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	The domestic statutory income tax rate was approximately 17.0% in fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
866374_17_ITEM8_P147_S1	The reconciliation of the income tax expense expected based on domestic statutory income tax rates to the expense for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows:
866374_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	A number of countries in which the Company is located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business.
866374_17_ITEM8_P148_S1	In general, these holidays were secured based on the nature, size and location of the Company s operations.
866374_17_ITEM8_P148_S2	The aggregate dollar effect on the Company s income resulting from tax holidays and tax incentives to attract and retain business for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $15.5 million , $6.6 million and $9.8 million , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM8_P148_S3	For fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 , the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share was $0.03 and $0.03 , respectively, and the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.01 and $0.01 during fiscal year 2016 , and $0.02 and $0.02 during fiscal year 2015 , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM8_P148_S4	Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, the Company's existing holidays will expire in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 through fiscal year 2022 .
866374_17_ITEM8_P149_S0	For fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company released valuation allowances totaling $39.6 million , $63.3 million and $55.0 million , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM8_P150_S0	releases were primarily related to our operations in Austria, China, Ireland and Canada that were deemed to be more likely than not to realize the respective deferred tax assets due to sustained profitability during the prior three fiscal years as well as continued forecasted profitability of those subsidiaries.
866374_17_ITEM8_P150_S1	However, these valuation allowance eliminations were offset by other current period valuation allowance movements primarily related to current period valuation allowance additions due to increased deferred tax assets related to current period losses in legal entities with existing full valuation allowance positions.
866374_17_ITEM8_P150_S2	In addition, due to increased negative evidence during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, the Company added a valuation allowance of $14.4 million for a Chinese subsidiary which did not previously have a valuation allowance recorded.
866374_17_ITEM8_P150_S3	For fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the offsetting amounts totaled $103.9 million , $64.3 million and $57.5 million , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM8_P151_S0	Under its territorial tax system, Singapore generally does not tax foreign sourced income until repatriated to Singapore.
866374_17_ITEM8_P151_S1	The Company has included the effects of Singapore's territorial tax system in the rate differential line above.
866374_17_ITEM8_P151_S2	The tax effect of foreign income not repatriated to Singapore for the fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were $67.9 million , $36.6 million and $0.0 million , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM8_P151_S3	The components of deferred income taxes are as follows:
866374_17_ITEM8_P152_S0	Utilization of the Company's deferred tax assets is limited by the future earnings of the Company in the tax jurisdictions in which such deferred assets arose.
866374_17_ITEM8_P152_S1	As a result, management is uncertain as to when or whether these operations will generate sufficient profit to realize any benefit from the deferred tax assets.
866374_17_ITEM8_P153_S0	The valuation allowance provides a reserve against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized by the Company.
866374_17_ITEM8_P154_S0	The change in valuation allowance is net of certain increases and decreases to prior year losses and other carryforwards that have no current impact on the tax provision.
866374_17_ITEM8_P154_S1	The Company has recorded deferred tax assets of approximately $2.4 billion related to tax losses and other carryforwards against which the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for all but $128.5 million of the deferred tax assets.
866374_17_ITEM8_P154_S2	These tax losses and other carryforwards will expire at various dates as follows:
866374_17_ITEM8_P155_S0	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced or increased in the near-term if facts, including the amount of taxable income or the mix of taxable income between subsidiaries, differ from management s estimates.
866374_17_ITEM8_P155_S1	The Company does not provide for income taxes on approximately $1.2 billion of undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of Singapore as management has plans for the use of such earnings to fund certain activities outside of Singapore.
866374_17_ITEM8_P155_S2	Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
866374_17_ITEM8_P155_S3	As of March 31, 2017, we have provided for applicable foreign withholding taxes on $70.6 million of undistributed foreign earnings related to certain Chinese subsidiaries whose earnings are not intended to be permanently reinvested, and recorded an associate deferred tax liability of approximately $7.1 million .
866374_17_ITEM8_P155_S4	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
866374_17_ITEM8_P156_S0	The Company s unrecognized tax benefits are subject to change over the next twelve months primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and as audits are settled.
866374_17_ITEM8_P156_S1	The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by an estimated range of an additional $9 million to $12 million within the next twelve months primarily due to potential settlements of various audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.
866374_17_ITEM8_P157_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file federal, state, and local income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions around world.
866374_17_ITEM8_P157_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2007 .
866374_17_ITEM8_P158_S0	Of the $203.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2017 , $185.4 million will affect the annual effective tax rate ("ETR") if the benefits are eventually recognized.
866374_17_ITEM8_P158_S1	The amount that doesn t impact the ETR relates to positions that would be settled with a tax loss carryforward previously subject to a valuation allowance.
866374_17_ITEM8_P159_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within the Company's tax expense.
866374_17_ITEM8_P159_S1	During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately ($1.6) million and ($2.4) million and $2.5 million , respectively.
866374_17_ITEM8_P159_S2	The Company had approximately $12.9 million , $14.6 million and $17.0 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

866374_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2017 .
866374_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2017 , the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	(b) Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Officer, an evaluation was conducted of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").
866374_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2017 .
866374_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements or prevent or detect instances of fraud.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management's annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017 excluded the internal control over financial reporting of three of our acquisitions that were completed during the year ended March 31, 2017 , which constitute, in the aggregate, 1% of total assets and 2% of net sales of the consolidated financial statements amount as of, and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 .
866374_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Flex Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	As described in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of four acquisitions that were completed during the year ended March 31, 2017, which constitute, in aggregate, 1% of total assets and 2% of net sales of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting of four acquisitions.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P4_S3	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P4_S5	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
866374_17_ITEM9A_P4_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P4_S7	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P4_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P5_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
866374_17_ITEM9A_P5_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2017 of the Company and our report dated May 16, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

866374_18_ITEM1_P4_S4	Over the past several years, we have evolved beyond a traditional Electronics Manufacturing Services ("EMS") company, and now consider Flex to be a provider of a full range of Sketch-to-Scale tm services beyond electronics manufacturing services including strategic product development planning and design-phase innovation, supported by teams of talented design engineers.
866374_18_ITEM1_P4_S5	Our innovation strategy is focused on three levels: products, systems, and manufacturing technologies and processes.
866374_18_ITEM1_P4_S6	We believe that the combination of our extensive innovation platform solutions, design and engineering services, advanced supply chain management solutions and services, significant scale and global presence, and manufacturing campuses in low-cost geographies provide us with a competitive advantage and strong differentiation in the market for designing, manufacturing, and servicing consumer and enterprise products for leading multinational and regional companies.

866374_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Our expertise is Sketch-to-Scale tm services: design, manufacture, and supply chain services for a broad range of products, from electronics to athletic shoes.
866374_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Although Flex has evolved beyond traditional EMS, the majority of our customers are electronics original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"); as such, the closest broad definition of our industry remains the outsourced EMS industry.
866374_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	EMS has experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elect to outsource some or all of their design, manufacturing, and after-market services requirements.
866374_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	In recent years, we have seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, primarily in the technology sector.
866374_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	Companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, internet service providers, or e-commerce retailers are entering the highly competitive and rapidly evolving hardware markets, with products including mobile devices, home entertainment products, and wearable devices.
866374_18_ITEM1_P8_S3	This trend has resulted in significant changes to the hardware manufacturing and supply chain solutions requirements of such companies.
866374_18_ITEM1_P8_S4	Increasingly complex products require highly customized supply chain solutions, in turn resulting in significant changes to the overall manufacturing and supply chain landscape.
866374_18_ITEM1_P8_S5	The growth of the overall industry for calendar year 2017 is estimated to have been around 5% .
866374_18_ITEM1_P8_S6	We believe the total available market for the EMS industry is poised for continued growth, with current penetration rates estimated to be about 31% .
866374_18_ITEM1_P8_S7	The intensely competitive nature of the electronics industry, the increasing complexity and sophistication of electronics products, and pressure on OEMs to reduce product costs and shorten product life cycles are all factors that encourage OEMs to utilize supply chain service providers as part of their business and manufacturing strategies.
866374_18_ITEM1_P8_S8	Utilizing global manufacturing and service providers allows OEMs to take advantage of the global design, manufacturing and supply chain management expertise of such providers, and enables OEMs to concentrate on product research, development, marketing, and sales.
866374_18_ITEM1_P8_S9	We believe that OEMs realize a number of important benefits through their strategic relationships with EMS providers, including:
866374_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Ability to focus on core branding and R D initiatives.
866374_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	We believe that growth in the EMS industry will be largely driven by the need for OEMs to respond to rapidly changing markets and technologies, the increasing complexity of supply chains and the continued pressure to be cost competitive.
866374_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	Additionally, we believe that there are significant opportunities for global EMS providers to win additional business from OEMs in markets or industry segments that have yet to substantially utilize such providers.
866374_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	SERVICE OFFERINGS We offer a broad range of customizable services to our customers.

866374_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	Our broad geographic footprint and experiences with multiple product types and complexity levels create a significant competitive advantage.
866374_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	We continually look for new ways to diversify our offering within each market segment.
866374_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Customer and Product Innovation Centers .
866374_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	We have established state-of-the art innovation centers in the Americas, Asia and Europe, with differentiated offerings and specialized services and focus.
866374_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	Some of these offerings include the most advanced 3D plastic printing, 3D metal printing, surface mount technology (SMT), and X-ray and test equipment to support major industries in bringing innovative products to market rapidly.
866374_18_ITEM1_P52_S3	We also have a reliability and failure analysis lab and an automation applications team.
866374_18_ITEM1_P52_S4	Another key feature is our focus on confidentiality and security as we offer dedicated customer-confidential work spaces that provide increased security and restricted access to protect our customers' intellectual property ("IP") and the confidentiality of new products being launched into the marketplace.
866374_18_ITEM1_P52_S5	These innovation centers offer our customers a geographically-focused version of our Sketch-to-Scale tm services, taking their product from concept to volume production and go-to-market in a rapid, cost effective and low risk manner.
866374_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	Industrial Parks; Low-Cost Manufacturing Services .
866374_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	We have developed self-contained campuses that co-locate our manufacturing and logistics operations with our suppliers in various, low-cost locations.
866374_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	These industrial parks enhance our supply chain management efficiency, while providing a low-cost, multi-technology solution for our customers.
866374_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	This approach increases the competitiveness of our customers by reducing logistical barriers and costs, improving communications, increasing flexibility, lowering transportation costs and reducing turnaround times.
866374_18_ITEM1_P53_S4	We have strategically established our industrial parks in Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, Mexico and Poland .
866374_18_ITEM1_P53_S5	We have selected manufacturing operations situated in low-cost regions of the world to provide our customers with a wide array of manufacturing solutions and low manufacturing costs.
866374_18_ITEM1_P53_S6	As of March 31, 2018 , approximately 80% of our manufacturing capacity was located in low-cost locations, such as Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and the Ukraine.
866374_18_ITEM1_P53_S7	We believe we are a global industry leader in low-cost production capabilities.
866374_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	CUSTOMERS Our customers include many of the world's leading technology companies.
866374_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	We have focused on establishing long-term relationships with our customers and have been successful in expanding our relationships to incorporate additional product lines and services.
866374_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	As our business spans multiple end markets, we believe that we are well-positioned through our market diversification to grow faster than the industry average and successfully navigate through difficult economic times.
866374_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	As an example, we serve the following key customers across our diverse business groups: health solutions customers Abbott and Johnson Johnson and auto customers Ford and Nexteer in our HRS segment; Teradyne, Applied Materials and Xerox in our IEI segment; Cisco, Nokia Solutions and Huawei in our CEC segment; and Lenovo/Motorola, Nike and Bose in our CTG segment.
866374_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	We continually look for new ways to diversify our offering within each market segment.
866374_18_ITEM1_P55_S3	In fiscal year 2018 , our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of net sales.
866374_18_ITEM1_P55_S4	No customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's net sales in fiscal year 2018 .
866374_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	BACKLOG Although we obtain firm purchase orders from our customers, OEM customers typically do not place firm orders for delivery of products more than 30 to 90 days in advance.
866374_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	In addition, OEM customers may reschedule or cancel firm orders depending on contractual arrangements.
866374_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	Therefore, we do not believe that the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales.
866374_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	COMPETITION Our market is extremely competitive and includes many companies, several of which have achieved substantial market share.
866374_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	We compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturing service providers, as well as our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	We face particular competition from Asian-based competitors, including Taiwanese Original Design Manufacturing ("ODM") suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	We compete with different companies depending on the type of service we are providing or the geographic area in which an activity takes place.
866374_18_ITEM1_P57_S4	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the manufacturing services market are: quality and range of services; design and technological capabilities; cost; location of facilities; and responsiveness and flexibility.
866374_18_ITEM1_P57_S5	We believe we are extremely competitive with regard to all of these factors.
866374_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Our Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility ("CSER") management system has several elements, including environmental, health and safety compliance, labor and human rights, ethics, governance, and community engagement.
866374_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	Flex's CSER framework is based upon the principles, policies, and standards prescribed by the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a worldwide association of electronics companies committed to promoting an industry code of conduct for global electronics supply chains to improve working and environmental, health and safety conditions, as well as other relevant international standards (e.g., ISO 14001, United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights).
866374_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	Flex is a founding member of the RBA.
866374_18_ITEM1_P58_S3	Social responsibility is also an area of increasing regulation, with specific regulations such as the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation on Human Trafficking and the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015, all creating new compliance and disclosure obligations for the Company and for our customers.
866374_18_ITEM1_P58_S4	We operate a number of programs, including compliance audits, data collection, training and leadership programs that focus upon driving continuous improvement in social, ethical, and environmental performance throughout all of our global operating units, all in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
866374_18_ITEM1_P58_S5	We also go beyond compliance by offering a wide range of programs and initiatives to engage both our internal and external stakeholders.
866374_18_ITEM1_P58_S6	At the heart of this endeavor lies our pragmatic goal of positively influencing the lives of people in the communities in which we operate.
866374_18_ITEM1_P58_S7	We intend to continue investing in these global communities through grant-making, financial contributions, volunteer work, direct engagement and donation of resources.
866374_18_ITEM1_P58_S8	All of these activities are the subject of our annual sustainability reporting, done in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative s (GRI) standards and as updated semi-annually on the Flex website.
866374_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), Section 1502, introduced reporting requirements related to the verification of whether we are directly (or indirectly through suppliers of materials) purchasing the following minerals ("Conflict Minerals"): columbite-tantalite, also known as coltan (the metal ore from which tantalum is extracted); cassiterite (the metal ore from which tin is extracted); gold; wolframite (the metal ore from which tungsten is extracted); or their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten; or any other mineral or its derivatives as determined by the Secretary of State associated with financing conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country.
866374_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	requirements necessary to comply with this law.
866374_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	We have filed the required reports on Form SD with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act.
866374_18_ITEM1_P60_S2	In addition, Flex is a participant in the RBA s Responsible Minerals Initiative, which is evaluating the supply chain risks of Conflict Minerals and other minerals (e.g., cobalt) and studying how to mitigate those risks.
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	We have implemented processes and procedures to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	We do not believe that costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating results, or competitive position.
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S3	In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third-party sites.
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S4	We engage environmental consulting firms to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities associated with our ongoing operations, historical disposal activities and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements.
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S5	We determine the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the probability of occurrence and the reasonable possibility of incurring costs in light of information currently available.
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S6	The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations, the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by us at our operating facilities, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters.
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S7	Additionally, we could be required to alter our operations in order to comply with any new standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations.
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S8	There can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no issue is currently known.
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S9	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of product environmental compliance regulations focused upon the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S10	EU Directive REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals"), and China RoHS entitled, Management Methods for Controlling Pollution for Electronic Information Products ("EIPs").
866374_18_ITEM1_P61_S11	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including the United States.
866374_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	Our business requires close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to mitigate risks of non-compliance.
866374_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	We have developed rigorous compliance programs designed to meet the needs and specifications of our customers as well as the regulations.
866374_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	These programs vary from collecting compliance or material data from our Flex controlled or managed suppliers to full laboratory testing, and we include compliance requirements in our standard supplier contracts.
866374_18_ITEM1_P62_S3	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	In the case of WEEE, although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations.
866374_18_ITEM1_P63_S2	Flex continues to monitor developments related to product environmental compliance and is working with our customers and other technical organizations to anticipate and minimize any impacts to our operations.
866374_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	EMPLOYEES As of March 31, 2018 , our global workforce totaled approximately 200,000 employees including our flexible (temporary) workforce.
866374_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by work councils.
866374_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	We have never experienced a significant work stoppage or strike, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
866374_18_ITEM1_P64_S3	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees.
866374_18_ITEM1_P64_S4	The loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business, results of operations and business prospects.
866374_18_ITEM1_P64_S5	To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel.
866374_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	We own or license various United States and foreign patents relating to a variety of technologies.
866374_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	For certain of our proprietary processes, inventions, and works of authorship, we rely on trade secret or copyright protection.
866374_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	We also maintain trademark rights (including registrations) for our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the United States and other countries throughout the world.
866374_18_ITEM1_P65_S3	We have implemented appropriate policies and procedures (including both technological means and training programs for our employees) to identify and protect out intellectual property, as well as that of our customers and suppliers.
866374_18_ITEM1_P65_S4	As of March 31, 2018 and 2017 , the carrying value of our intellectual property was not material.
866374_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	Although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it, from time to time third parties do assert patent infringement claims against us or our customers.
866374_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	In addition, we provide design and engineering services to our customers and also design and make our own products.
866374_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	As a consequence of these activities, our customers are requiring us to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses.
866374_18_ITEM1_P66_S3	If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_18_ITEM1_P66_S4	Such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor.
866374_18_ITEM1_P66_S5	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome.
866374_18_ITEM1_P66_S6	We also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services.
866374_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	From time to time, we enter into intellectual property licenses (e.g., patent licenses and software licenses) with third parties which obligate us to report covered behavior to the licensor and pay license fees to the licensor for certain activities or products, or that enable our use of third party technologies.
866374_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	We may also decline to enter into licenses for intellectual property that we do not think is useful for or used in our operations, or for which our customers or suppliers have licenses or have assumed responsibility.
866374_18_ITEM1_P67_S2	Given the diverse and varied nature of our business and the location of our business around the world, certain activities we perform, such as providing assembly services in China and India, may fall outside the scope of those licenses or may not be subject to the applicable intellectual property rights.
866374_18_ITEM1_P67_S3	Our licensors may disagree and claim royalties are owed for such activities.
866374_18_ITEM1_P67_S4	In addition, the basis (e.g. base price) for any royalty amounts owed are audited by licensors and may be challenged.
866374_18_ITEM1_P67_S5	Some of these disagreements may lead to claims and litigation that might not be resolved in our favor.
866374_18_ITEM1_P67_S6	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome.
866374_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS Refer to note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for financial information about our business segments and geographic areas.
866374_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Our Internet address is https://www.flex.com.
866374_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	We make available through our Internet website the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
866374_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	We were incorporated in the Republic of Singapore in May 1990.
866374_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	Our principal corporate office is located at 2 Changi South Lane, Singapore 486123.
866374_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	Our U.S. corporate headquarters is located at 6201 America Center Drive, San Jose, CA 95002.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We derive our revenues from customers in the following business groups:
866374_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	HRS, which is comprised of our health solutions business, including consumer health, digital health, disposables, precision plastics, drug delivery, diagnostics, life sciences and imaging equipment; our automotive business, including vehicle electrification, connectivity, autonomous vehicles, and clean technologies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Factors affecting any of these industries in general or our customers in particular, could adversely impact us.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	there may be recessionary periods in our customers' markets.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and our current and potential customers may decide to manufacture some or all of their products internally, which could harm our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Cancellations, reductions, or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers have harmed, and may in the future harm, our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and deliver for these customers, by causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders, and by lowering our asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Additionally, current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our capabilities against other providers as well as against the merits of manufacturing products themselves.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our business would be adversely affected if customers decide to perform these functions internally or transfer their business to another provider.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In addition, we face competition from the manufacturing operations of some of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In the past, some of our customers moved a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Any of these developments could cause a decline in our sales, loss of market acceptance of our products or services, decreases of our profits or loss of our market share.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	As a provider of design and manufacturing services and components for electronics, we must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround time for our customers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and we often experience reduced lead times in customer orders which may be less than the lead time we require to procure necessary components and materials.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of our customers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	This makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In that regard, we must make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, setting production schedules, making component procurement commitments, and allocating personnel and other resources based on our estimates of our customers' requirements.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production or require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to reduce costs or achieve other objectives.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These demands stress our resources, can cause supply chain management issues, and reduce our margins.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands, and transfers from one facility to another can result in inefficiencies and costs due to excess capacity in one facility and corresponding capacity constraints at another.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, thus customer order fluctuations, deferrals, and transfers of demand from one facility to another, as described above, have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past and we may experience such effects in the future.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Our industry is extremely competitive; if we are not able to continue to provide competitive services, we may lose business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We compete with a number of different companies, depending on the type of service we provide or the location of our operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	For example, we compete with major global EMS providers, other smaller EMS companies that have a regional or product-specific focus and ODMs with respect to some of the services that we provide.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S7	We also compete with our current and prospective customers, who evaluate our capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Our industry is extremely competitive, many of our competitors have achieved substantial market share, and some may have lower cost structures or greater design, manufacturing, financial or other resources than we do.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S9	We face particular competition from Asian-based competitors, including Taiwanese ODM suppliers who compete in a variety of our end markets and have a substantial share of global information technology hardware production.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S10	If we are unable to provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at lower cost than the other companies in our market, our net sales could decline.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S11	A significant percentage of our sales come from a small number of customers and a decline in sales to any of these customers could adversely affect our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Sales to our ten largest customers represent a significant percentage of our net sales.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S13	Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 41% , 43% and 46% of net sales in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S14	No customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2018 and 2017.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P6_S15	Only Lenovo/Motorola, which is reflected in our CTG segment, accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2016 .
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our principal customers have varied from year to year.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	These customers may experience dramatic declines in their market shares or competitive position, due to economic or other forces, that may cause them to reduce their purchases from us or, in some cases, result in the termination of their relationship with us.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Significant reductions in sales to any of these customers, or the loss of major customers, would materially harm our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If we are not able to timely replace expired, canceled or reduced contracts with new business, our revenues and profitability could be harmed.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Additionally, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or other significant transactions involving our key customers generally entail risks to our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	If a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by the largest customers, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Our components business is dependent on our ability to quickly launch world-class components products, and our investment in the development of our component capabilities, together with the start-up and integration costs necessary to achieve quick launches of world-class components products, may adversely affect our margins and profitability.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Our components business, which includes rigid and flexible printed circuit board fabrication, and power supply manufacturing, is part of our strategy to improve our competitive position and to grow our future margins, profitability and shareholder returns by expanding our capabilities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S8	The success of our components business is dependent on our ability to design and introduce world- class components that have performance characteristics which are suitable for a broad market and that offer significant price and/or performance advantages over competitive products.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S9	To create these world class components offerings, we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our components capabilities, in resources such as research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, facility expansions and personnel requirements.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S10	We may not be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance for any of our components offerings in any of our current or target markets.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S11	The success of our components business will also depend upon the level of market acceptance of our customers' end products, which incorporate our components, and over which we have no control.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S12	In addition, customers often require unique configurations or custom designs, which must be developed and integrated in the customer's product well before the customer launches the product.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S13	Thus, there is often substantial lead-time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized component and the commencement of volume shipments of the component to the customer.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S14	As a result, we may make substantial investments in the development and customization of products for our customers, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not accept the customized component.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P7_S15	Even if our customers accept the customized component, if our customers do not purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our achievement of anticipated levels of profitability in our components business is also dependent on our ability to achieve efficiencies in our manufacturing as well as to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our customers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability in our components business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If some of our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our products from these customers could decline.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty we could have difficulty sourcing supplies necessary to fulfill production requirements and meet scheduled shipments.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P8_S6	If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivable are outstanding.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	On April 21, 2016, SunEdison, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries ( SunEdison ) filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we recognized a bad debt reserve charge of $61.0 million associated with our outstanding SunEdison receivables and accepted return of previously shipped inventory of approximately $90 million.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, prices for solar panel modules declined significantly.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We determined that certain solar panel inventory previously designated for SunEdison on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 was not fully recoverable and recorded a charge of $60.0 million to reduce the carrying costs to market during fiscal year 2017.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition, we recognized a $16.0 million impairment charge for solar module equipment and incurred $16.9 million of incremental costs primarily related to negative margin sales and other associated solar panel direct costs.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	The estimates underlying our recorded provisions, as well as consideration of other potential customer bankruptcy-related contingencies associated with the SunEdison bankruptcy proceedings, are based on the facts currently known to us; no preference claims have been asserted against the Company.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P9_S6	SunEdison stated in schedules filed with the Bankruptcy Court that, within the 90 days preceding SunEdison's bankruptcy filing, the Company received approximately $98.6 million of inventory and cash transfers of $69.2 million, which in aggregate represents the Company's estimate of the maximum reasonably possible contingent loss.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	On April 15, 2018, a subsidiary of the Company together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, entered into a tolling agreement with the trustee of the SunEdison Litigation Trust to toll any applicable statute of limitations or other time-related defense that might exist in regards to any potential claims that either party might be able to assert against the other for a period that will end at the earlier to occur of: (a) 60 days after a party provides written notice of termination; (b) six years from the effective date of April 15, 2018; or (c) such other date as the parties may agree in writing.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We believe that we continue to have a number of affirmative and direct defenses to any potential claims for recovery and intend to vigorously defend any such claim, if asserted.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	An unfavorable resolution of this matter could be material to our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We may be adversely affected by shortages of required electronic components.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	From time to time, we have experienced shortages of some of the electronic components that we use.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	These shortages can result from strong demand for those components or from problems experienced by suppliers, such as shortages of raw materials.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S6	These unanticipated component shortages could result in curtailed production or delays in production, which may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a reduction in sales, increase in inventory levels and costs, and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Component shortages may also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S9	As a result, component shortages could adversely affect our operating results.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to incorporate changes in component costs into the selling prices for our products.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S11	Our supply chain may also be impacted by other events outside our control, including macro-economic events, political crises or natural or environmental occurrences.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P10_S12	Our margins and profitability may be adversely affected due to substantial investments, start-up and production ramp costs in our design services.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	As part of our strategy to enhance our end-to-end service offerings, we continue to expand our design and engineering capabilities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Providing these services can expose us to different or greater potential risks than those we face when providing our manufacturing services.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Although we enter into contracts with our design services customers, we may design and develop products for these customers prior to receiving a purchase order or other firm commitment from them.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products, and no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, we may make investments in designing products and not be able to design viable manufacturable products, in which cases we may not be able to recover our investments.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Even if we are successful in designing manufacturable products and our customers accept our designs, if our customers do not then purchase anticipated levels of products, we may not realize any profits.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our design activities often require that we purchase inventory for initial production runs before we have a purchase commitment from a customer.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Even after we have a contract with a customer with respect to a product, these contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any particular volume of purchases.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	These contracts can generally be terminated on short notice.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	In addition, some of the products we design and develop must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some must receive government certifications.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P12_S7	If we fail to obtain these approvals or certifications on a timely basis, we would be unable to sell these products, which would harm our sales, profitability and reputation.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our design services offerings require significant investments in research and development, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, patent applications, facility building and expansion and recruitment.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We may not be able to achieve a high enough level of sales for this business to be profitable.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The initial costs of investing in the resources necessary to expand our design and engineering capabilities, and in particular to support our design services offerings, have historically adversely affected our profitability, and may continue to do so as we continue to make investments to grow these capabilities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In addition, we agree to certain product price limitations and cost reduction targets in connection with these services.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Inflationary and other increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor required to produce the products have occurred and may recur from time to time.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Also, the production ramps for these programs are typically significant and negatively impact our margin in early stages as the manufacturing volumes are lower and result in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P13_S6	We may not be able to reduce costs, incorporate changes in costs into the selling prices of our products, or increase operating efficiencies as we ramp production of our products, which would adversely affect our margins and our results of operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to the risks inherent in international operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The geographic distances between the Americas, Asia and Europe create a number of logistical and communications challenges for us.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	These challenges include managing operations across multiple time zones, directing the manufacture and delivery of products across distances, coordinating procurement of components and raw materials and their delivery to multiple locations, and coordinating the activities and decisions of the core management team, which is based in a number of different countries.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Facilities in several different locations may be involved at different stages of the production process of a single product, leading to additional logistical difficulties.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Because our manufacturing operations are located in a number of countries throughout the Americas, Asia and Europe, we are subject to risks of changes in economic and political conditions in those countries, including:
866374_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	a potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The attractiveness of our services to U.S. customers can be affected by changes in U.S. trade policies, such as most favored nation status and trade preferences for some Asian countries.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, some countries in which we operate, such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Mexico, Malaysia and Poland, have experienced periods of slow or negative growth, high inflation, significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Furthermore, in countries such as China, Brazil, India and Mexico, governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy, and their actions could have a significant effect on us.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure, including lack of adequate power and water supplies, transportation, raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	In addition, we may encounter labor disruptions and rising labor costs, in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Any increase in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P16_S8	In some countries, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert our cash distributions to U.S. dollars or other freely convertible currencies, or to move funds from our accounts in these countries.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Furthermore, the central bank of any of these countries may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to approve distributions to foreign investors.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P16_S10	Matters arising out of or relating to our Audit Committee s independent investigation, including litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings, may adversely affect our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As previously disclosed, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, with the assistance of independent outside counsel, undertook an independent investigation relating to the accounting treatment of customer obligations and certain related reserves.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The independent outside counsel also notified the San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).
866374_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	To date, we have incurred significant expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services in connection with the Audit Committee s independent investigation and related matters, and may continue to incur significant additional expenses with regard to these matters and related remediation efforts.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Following our announcement of the Audit Committee s independent investigation, a putative class action was filed in the Northern District of California against the Company and certain officers alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, promulgated thereunder, alleging misstatements and/or omissions in certain of the Company s financial statements, press releases, and SEC filings made during the putative class period of January 26, 2017 through April 26, 2018; and we could also become subject to additional future lawsuits or future regulatory investigations or proceedings relating to the subject matter of the independent investigation.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Any existing or future lawsuits and/or any future regulatory investigations or proceedings could be time-consuming, result in significant expense and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key employees, as well as harm our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in a material misstatement in our financial statements.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As further described in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, our management and our independent registered public accounting firm have concluded that, as of March 31, 2018, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to material weaknesses.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We determined that there was insufficient documentation of, and ineffective design of controls over, the accounting for accrued customer obligations related to customer contracts.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Factors contributing to this included insufficient training of site and segment operational and accounting personnel, and inadequate monitoring, including contract compliance, to ensure the components of internal control were present and functioning.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, the control environment was ineffective in ensuring that executive management s expectations of adherence to the Company s policies and standards of conduct were followed at all levels of the Company and in ensuring that any deviations therefrom were identified and corrected in a timely manner.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	These deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and aggregated to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the accounting for customer contractual obligations and aspects of our control environment and monitoring activities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	No material misstatements were identified in our financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	While management has put additional manual monitoring controls in place and has undertaken, and will continue to undertake steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting to address and remediate the material weaknesses, we cannot conclude at this time that the material weaknesses have been remediated.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully remediate the identified material weaknesses, or that we will not identify additional control deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P19_S8	If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities laws and Nasdaq listing requirements regarding the timely filing of periodic reports, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the price of our ordinary shares may decline.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The success of certain of our activities depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; claims of infringement or misuse of intellectual property and/or breach of license agreement provisions against our customers or us could harm our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We retain certain intellectual property rights to some of the technologies that we develop as part of our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The measures we have taken to prevent unauthorized use of our technology may not be successful.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our engineering, design and manufacturing services and components offerings involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of claims of infringement or misuse of intellectual property from third parties and/or breach of our agreements with third parties, as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property risk among us and our customers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	From time to time, we enter into intellectual property licenses (e.g., patent licenses and software licenses) with third parties which obligate us to report covered behavior to the licensor and pay license fees to the licensor for certain activities or products, or that enable our use of third party technologies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We may also decline to enter into licenses for intellectual property that we do not think is useful for or used in our operations, or for which our customers or suppliers have licenses or have assumed responsibility.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Given the diverse and varied nature of our business and the location of our business around the world, certain activities we perform, such as providing assembly services in China and India, may fall outside the scope of those licenses or may not be subject to the applicable intellectual property rights.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our licensors may disagree and claim royalties are owed for such activities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In addition, the basis (e.g. base price) for any royalty amounts owed are audited by licensors and may be challenged.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Our customers are increasingly requiring us to indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property-related claims and licensors are claiming that activities we perform are covered by licenses to which we are a party.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In March 2018, we received an inquiry from a licensor referencing a patent license agreement, and requesting information relating royalties for products that we assemble for a customer in China.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P21_S8	If any of these inquiries result in a claim, the Company intends to contest any such claim vigorously.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If a claim is asserted and we are unsuccessful in its defense, a material loss is reasonably possible.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We cannot predict or estimate an amount or reasonable range of outcomes with respect to the matter.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If any claims of infringement or misuse of intellectual property from third parties and/or breach of our agreements with third parties, as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property risk among us and our customers, are brought against us or our customers, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In the event of such a claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop alternatives or obtain licenses or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor, in which cases we may be required to curtail certain of our services and offerings.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly, and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of outcome.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	We are subject to risks relating to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	From time to time, we are involved in various claims, suits, investigations and legal proceedings.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Additional legal claims or regulatory matters may arise in the future and could involve matters relating to commercial disputes, government regulatory and compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax, employment or shareholder issues, product liability claims and other issues on a global basis.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we receive an adverse judgment in any such matter, we could be required to pay substantial damages and cease certain practices or activities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation and other proceedings may be both time- consuming and disruptive to our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	The defense and ultimate outcome of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operating expenses and a decrease in operating margin, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	A breach of our IT or physical security systems, or violation of data privacy laws, may cause us to incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	We rely on our information systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, and other business partners), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P23_S7	We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information systems.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P23_S8	We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P23_S9	We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and inventory and protecting our customers and our suppliers confidential information.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools, we are subject to, and at times have suffered from, breach of these security systems which have in the past and may in the future result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or unauthorized use or theft of the inventory or information we are trying to protect.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If unauthorized parties gain physical access to our inventory or if they gain electronic access to our information systems or if such information or inventory is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information or inventory could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties including our customers and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information or inventory, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, new data privacy laws and regulations, including the new European Union General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) effective May 2018, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and any failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our strategic relationships with major customers create risks.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In the past, we have completed numerous strategic transactions with customers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Under these arrangements, we generally acquire inventory, equipment and other assets from the customers, and lease or acquire their manufacturing facilities, while simultaneously entering into multi-year manufacturing and supply agreements for the production of their products.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	We may pursue these customer divestiture transactions in the future.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	These arrangements entered into with divesting customers typically involve many risks, including the following:
866374_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	if demand for the customers' products declines, the customer may reduce its volume of purchases, and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other customers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As a result of these and other risks, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, these strategic arrangements have not, and in the future may not, result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings per share.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If our compliance policies are breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We have implemented local and global compliance policies to ensure compliance with our legal obligations across our operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P26_S5	A significant legal risk resulting from our international operations is compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local laws of the countries in which we do business, including the UK Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits covered companies from making payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Our Code of Business Conduct prohibits corrupt payments on a global basis and precludes us from offering or giving anything of value to a government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, to win a business advantage or to improperly influence a decision regarding Flex.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents will refrain from taking actions in violation of this and our related anti-corruption policies and procedures.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P26_S8	Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P26_S9	We are subject to the risk of increased income taxes.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated efforts by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns over perceived international tax avoidance techniques, which could ultimately have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA ) into law.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Effective January 1, 2018, among other changes, the TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, provides for a deemed repatriation and taxation at reduced rates of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries owned by U.S. companies historical earnings (a transition tax ), and establishes new mechanisms to tax such earnings going forward.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Similar to other large multinational companies with complex tax structures, the TCJA has wide ranging implications for us.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We will continue to analyze the effects of the TCJA on our financial statements and operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In addition, legislative changes may result from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Any such changes, if adopted, could adversely impact our effective tax rate.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Our taxes could also increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Our continued ability to qualify for specific tax holiday extensions will depend on, among other things, our anticipated investment and expansion in these countries and the manner in which the local governments interpret the requirements for modifications, extensions or new incentives.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P30_S6	In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions around the world.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	However, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax provision, operating results, financial position and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	If we do not effectively manage changes in our operations, our business may be harmed; we have taken substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may need to take material restructuring charges in the future.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	The expansion of our business, as well as business contractions and other changes in our customers' requirements, have in the past, and may in the future, require that we adjust our business and cost structures by incurring restructuring charges.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Restructuring activities involve reductions in our workforce at some locations and closure of certain facilities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P31_S7	All of these changes have in the past placed, and may in the future place, considerable strain on our financial and management control systems and resources, including decision support, accounting management, information systems and facilities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P31_S8	If we do not properly manage our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures to manage our employees, our business could be harmed.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In recent years, including during fiscal year 2018, we initiated targeted restructuring activities focused on optimizing the our cost structure in lower growth areas and, more importantly, streamlining certain corporate and segment functions.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Restructuring charges are recorded based upon employee termination dates, site closure and consolidation plans generally in conjunction with an overall corporate initiative to drive cost reduction and realign the Company's global footprint.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	While we incurred severance, asset impairment charges and other charges as a result of changes in our customer mix on an ongoing basis, such individual actions were not considered material and did not qualify as restructuring charges per accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to be separately disclosed as restructuring charges in fiscal year 2016 and are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Our restructuring activities undertaken during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 have been disclosed separately on our statement of operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We may be required to take additional charges in the future to align our operations and cost structures with global economic conditions, market demands, cost competitiveness, and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers' production requirements.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P32_S5	We may consolidate certain manufacturing facilities or transfer certain of our operations to lower cost geographies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P32_S6	If we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Additionally, there are other potential risks associated with our restructurings that could adversely affect us, such as delays encountered with the finalization and implementation of the restructuring activities, work stoppages, and the failure to achieve targeted cost savings.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Changes in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	For example, significant changes to revenue recognition rules have been enacted and will begin to apply to us in fiscal year 2019 per Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".
866374_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Changes to accounting rules or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" within note 2 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may encounter difficulties with acquisitions and divestitures, which could harm our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We have completed numerous acquisitions of businesses and we may acquire additional businesses in the future.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Any future acquisitions may require additional equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, or additional debt financing, which could increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P35_S4	As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P35_S5	To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P35_S6	The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P35_S7	The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P35_S8	In addition, the integration of acquired businesses may require that we incur significant restructuring charges.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P35_S9	In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including:
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In addition, divestitures involve significant risks, including without limitation, difficulty finding financially sufficient buyers or selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and, under certain circumstances, require us to record impairment charges or a loss as a result of the transaction.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, completing divestitures requires expenses and management attention and could leave us with certain continuing liabilities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	These and other factors have harmed, and in the future could harm, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition or divestiture, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes for medical devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S6	As a medical device manufacturer, we have additional compliance requirements.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S7	We are required to register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S8	Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring by the FDA.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S9	If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance with QSR or other FDA regulations, and the Company does not address the observation adequately to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA may take action against us.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S10	FDA actions may include issuing a letter of inspectional observations, issuing a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the Company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, refusing requests for clearance or approval of new products or withdrawal of clearance or approval previously granted, issuing an import detention on products entering the U.S. from an offshore facility, or shutting down a manufacturing facility.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P36_S11	If any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In the European Union ("EU"), we are required to maintain certain standardized certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections to obtain and maintain these certifications.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Continued noncompliance to the EU regulations could stop the flow of products into the EU from us or from our customers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In China, the Safe Food and Drug Administration controls and regulates the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We must comply with the regulatory laws applicable to medical device manufactures or our ability to manufacture products in China could be impacted.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In Japan, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws regulate the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	These regulations also require that subcontractors manufacturing products intended for sale in Japan register with authorities and submit to regulatory audits.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Other Asian countries and Latin America where we operate have similar laws regarding the regulation of medical device manufacturing.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If our products or components contain defects, demand for our services may decline and we may be exposed to product liability and product warranty liability.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation and expose us to product liability or product warranty claims.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Product liability claims may include liability for personal injury or property damage.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Product warranty claims may include liability to pay for the recall, repair or replacement of a product or component.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Although we generally allocate liability for these claims in our contracts with our customers, increasingly we are unsuccessful in allocating such liability, and even where we have allocated liability to our customers, our customers may not have the resources to satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product or component for which they have assumed responsibility.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	If we design, engineer or manufacture a product or component that is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could spend a significant amount of money to resolve the claim.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P40_S6	In addition, product liability and product recall insurance coverage are expensive and may not be available for some or all of our services offerings on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P40_S7	A successful product liability or product warranty claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied, limited or is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P40_S8	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our operating costs.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have manufacturing operations and industrial parks that are located in lower cost regions of the world, such as Asia, Eastern Europe and Mexico.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	A portion of our purchases and our sale transactions are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in these currencies impacting our fixed cost overhead or our supply base relative to the currencies in which we conduct transactions.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors, including changes in a country's political and economic policies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Volatility in the functional and non-functional currencies of our entities and the United States dollar could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The primary impact of currency exchange fluctuations is on the cash, receivables, payables and expenses of our operating entities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	As part of our currency hedging strategy, we use financial instruments such as forward exchange, swap contracts, and options to hedge our foreign currency exposure in order to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on our operating results.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If our hedging activities are not successful or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected fluctuations in our operating results as a result of changes in exchange rates.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We are also exposed to risks related to the valuation of the Chinese currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The Chinese currency is the renminbi ("RMB").
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	A significant increase in the value of the RMB could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows by increasing both our manufacturing costs and the costs of our local supply base.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to seasonal demand.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Two of our significant end markets are the mobile devices market and the consumer devices market.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S4	These markets exhibit particular strength generally in the two quarters leading up to the end of the calendar year in connection with the holiday season.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S5	As a result, we have historically experienced stronger revenues in our second and third fiscal quarters as compared to our other fiscal quarters.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Economic or other factors leading to diminished orders in the end of the calendar year could harm our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S7	We depend on our executive officers and skilled management personnel.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S8	Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S9	Generally, our employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S10	We could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S11	We will need to recruit and retain skilled management personnel, and if we are not able to do so, our business could be harmed.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S12	In addition, in connection with expanding our design services offerings, we must attract and retain experienced design engineers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S13	There is substantial competition in our industry for highly skilled employees.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S14	Our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our design services offerings, which could adversely affect our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S15	Our failure to comply with environmental laws could adversely affect our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S16	We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including regulations governing the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used in our manufacturing processes.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S17	We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the recyclability of products, the materials that may be included in products, and our obligations to dispose of these products after end users have finished with them.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S18	Additionally, we may be exposed to liability to our customers relating to the materials that may be included in the components that we procure for our customers' products.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S19	Any violation or alleged violation by us of environmental laws could subject us to significant costs, fines or other penalties.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S20	We are also required to comply with an increasing number of global and local product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S21	We are subject to the EU directives, including the Restrictions on RoHS, the WEEE as well as the EU's REACH regulation.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P44_S22	In addition, new technical classifications of e-Waste being discussed in the Basel Convention technical working group could affect both our customers' abilities and obligations in electronics repair and refurbishment.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Also of note is China's Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by EIPs regulation, commonly referred to as "China RoHS", which restricts the importation into and production within China of electrical equipment containing certain hazardous materials.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	RoHS and other similar legislation bans or restricts the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as applicable regulations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These programs may include collecting compliance data from our suppliers, full laboratory testing and public reporting of other environmental metrics such as carbon emissions, electronic waste and water, and we also require our supply chain to comply.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Non-compliance could potentially result in significant costs and/or penalties.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	In the case of WEEE, the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P47_S4	However, customers may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their obligations under WEEE.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In addition, we are responsible for the cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	If more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed, or the results of future testing and analyses at our current or former operating facilities indicate that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the air, ground and/or water, we may be subject to additional liability.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Additional environmental matters may arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Additionally, we could be required to alter our manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental regulations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations or adequately address contaminated sites could limit our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to incur significant expenses, which would harm our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in the payment of significant damages, which would reduce our net income.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S6	We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, wages and overtime, discrimination, whistle-blowing, classification of employees and severance payments.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S7	Enforcement activity relating to these laws, particularly outside of the United States, can increase as a result of increased media attention due to violations by other companies, changes in law, political and other factors.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S8	There can be no assurance that we won't be found to have violated such laws in the future, due to a more aggressive enforcement posture by governmental authorities or for any other reason.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S9	Any such violations could lead to the assessment of fines against us by federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees, which fines could be substantial and which would reduce our net income.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S10	Our business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S11	We may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S12	Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, may not align with our business strategies and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S13	Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers and other third parties.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S14	Our debt level may create limitations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S15	As of March 31, 2018 , our total debt was approximately $2.9 billion .
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S16	This level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S17	Changes in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital or to borrow additional funds.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S18	We may also be exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our outstanding borrowings and investments.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S19	Our credit is rated by credit rating agencies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S20	Our 4.625% Notes, our 5.000% Notes and our 4.750% Notes are currently rated BBB- by Standard and Poor's ("S P") which is considered to be investment grade by S P, rated Baa3 by Moody s which is considered to be investment grade by Moody's, and rated BBB- by Fitch which is considered to be "investment grade" by Fitch.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S21	Any decline in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all, negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares, increase our interest payments under some of our existing debt agreements, and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S22	In addition, the interest rate payable on some of our credit facilities is subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit ratings change.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S23	Thus, any potential future negative change in our credit rating may increase the interest rate payable on these credit facilities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S24	In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk under our variable rate terms loans, bilateral facilities and revolving credit facility for indebtedness we have incurred or may incur under such borrowings.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S25	The interest rates under these borrowings are based on either (i) a margin over LIBOR or (ii) the base rate (the greatest of the agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin, in each case depending on our credit rating.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S26	Refer to the discussion in note 8, "Bank Borrowings and Long-Term Debt" to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our debt obligations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S27	We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our invested cash balances, our securitization facilities and our factoring activities.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S28	Weak global economic conditions, geopolitical uncertainty and instability in financial markets may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and access to capital markets.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P48_S29	Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which our customers compete.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	challenging conditions in the electronics industry.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	For example, these conditions may be adversely impacted by the pending withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU following its referendum on EU membership and the actions that the U.S. has taken or may take with respect to certain treaty and trade relationships with other countries.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	These conditions may result in reduced consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries, a tightening in the credit markets, a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets, high volatility in credit, fixed income and equity markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and global economic uncertainty.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P49_S3	In addition, longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P49_S4	If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other corporate purposes.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters, terrorist activity, public health issues, cyber security incidents, interruptions of service from utilities, transportation or telecommunications providers, or other catastrophic events.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P49_S8	While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	However, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	The policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of self-insurance.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Our business could be adversely affected by any delays, or increased costs, resulting from issues that our common carriers are dealing with in transporting our materials, our products, or both.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We rely on a variety of common carriers to transport our materials from our suppliers to us, and to transport our products from us to our customers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Problems suffered by any of these common carriers, whether due to a natural disaster, labor problem, increased energy prices, criminal activity or some other issue, could result in shipping delays, increased costs, or other supply chain disruptions, and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We are subject to risks associated with investments.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We invest in private funds and companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We make investments in private funds and companies to further our strategic objectives, support key business initiatives and develop business relationships with related portfolio companies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P52_S4	If any of the funds or companies in which we invest fail, we could lose all or part of our investment.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P52_S5	If we need to determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment, we would need to write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our business and operations could be adversely impacted by climate change initiatives.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Concern over climate change has led to international legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We also ascribe value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships, developed technology and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if we determine that the fair values of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	We evaluate, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and 'critical accounting policies' in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of our businesses and we could be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact our consolidated balance sheet, as well as our consolidated statement of operations.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	If we are required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact our consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under our existing credit facilities, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The market price of our ordinary shares is volatile.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of companies, including technology companies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	These fluctuations have often been unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	The market for our ordinary shares has been and may in the future be subject to similar volatility.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Factors such as fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of technological innovations or events affecting other companies in the electronics industry, currency fluctuations, general market fluctuations, and macro-economic conditions may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of "conflict minerals" may result in increased costs and risks to us.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals ("Minerals") that may have originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In our most recent report on Form SD, we reported that, based on our diligence review, we were unable to determine whether Minerals contained in our products originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries or whether the mining or trade of such Minerals directly or indirectly financed or otherwise benefited armed groups in those countries.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	We expect to undertake further reviews of our supply chain as necessary to comply with the SEC s requirements.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Additionally, customers rely on us to provide critical data regarding the products they purchase and request information on such Minerals.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Our materials sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and we may not be able to easily verify the origins of the Minerals used in the products we sell.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P59_S5	We have many suppliers and each may provide the required information in a different manner, if at all.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P59_S6	Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, our reputation may suffer if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the Minerals, if any, used in our products.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P59_S7	Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of any Minerals originating in the specified countries.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P59_S8	The implementation of this requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from our suppliers.
866374_18_ITEM1A_P59_S9	This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide products and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.
866374_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	The composition of the square footage of our facilities, by region, is as follows:
866374_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our facilities include large industrial parks, ranging in size from 0.5 million to 5.5 million square feet in Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, Mexico and Poland .
866374_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also have regional manufacturing operations, generally ranging in size from under 100,000 to approximately 1.6 million square feet in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Switzerland, the Ukraine and the United States.
866374_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also have smaller design and engineering centers, innovation centers and product introduction centers at a number of locations in the world's major industrial and electronics markets.
866374_18_ITEM2_P1_S3	Our facilities are well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted.

866374_18_ITEM5_P7_S2	All dividends are tax exempt to shareholders.
866374_18_ITEM5_P8_S0	Under current Singapore tax law there is no tax on capital gains, thus any profits from the disposal of shares are not taxable in Singapore unless the gains arising from the disposal of shares are income in nature and subject to tax, especially if they arise from activities which the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore regards as the carrying on of a trade or business in Singapore (in which case, the profits on the sale would be taxable as trade profits rather than capital gains).
866374_18_ITEM5_P9_S0	Shareholders who apply, or who are required to apply, the Singapore Financial Reporting Standard 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement ("FRS 39") for the purposes of Singapore income tax may be required to recognize gains or losses (not being gains or losses in the nature of capital) in accordance with the provisions of FRS 39 (as modified by the applicable provisions of Singapore income tax law) even though no sale or disposal of shares is made.
866374_18_ITEM5_P10_S0	There is no stamp duty payable for holding shares, and no duty is payable on the issue of new shares.
866374_18_ITEM5_P10_S1	When existing shares are acquired in Singapore, a stamp duty of 0.2% is payable on the instrument of transfer of the shares at market value.
866374_18_ITEM5_P10_S2	The stamp duty is borne by the purchaser unless there is an agreement to the contrary.
866374_18_ITEM5_P10_S3	If the instrument of transfer is executed outside of Singapore, the stamp duty must be paid only if the instrument of transfer is received in Singapore.
866374_18_ITEM5_P11_S0	The estate duty was abolished for deaths occurring on or after February 15, 2008.

866374_18_ITEM5_P12_S1	If property passing upon the death of an individual domiciled in Singapore includes our shares, Singapore estate duty is payable to the extent that the value of the shares aggregated with any other assets subject to Singapore estate duty exceeds S$600,000.
866374_18_ITEM5_P12_S2	Unless other exemptions apply to the other assets, for example, the separate exemption limit for residential properties, any excess beyond S$600,000 will be taxed at 5% on the first S$12,000,000 of the individual's chargeable assets and thereafter at 10%.

866374_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	OVERVIEW We are a globally-recognized, provider of Sketch-to-Scale tm services - innovative design, engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain services and solutions - from conceptual sketch to full-scale production.
866374_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	We design, build, ship and service complete packaged consumer and enterprise products, from athletic shoes to electronics, for companies of all sizes in various industries and end-markets, through our activities in the following segments:
866374_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	High Reliability Solutions ("HRS"), which is comprised of our health solutions business, including consumer health, digital health, disposables, precision plastics, drug delivery, diagnostics, life sciences and imaging equipment; our automotive business, including vehicle electrification, connectivity, autonomous vehicles, and clean technologies.
866374_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	These segments represent components of the Company for which separate financial information is available that is utilized on a regular basis by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ).
866374_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Our segments are determined based on several factors, including the nature of products and services, the nature of production processes, customer base, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics.
866374_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	Refer to note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information on our operating segments.
866374_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our strategy is to provide customers with a full range of cost competitive, vertically-integrated global supply chain solutions through which we can design, build, ship and service a complete packaged product for our customers.
866374_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	This enables our customers to leverage our supply chain solutions to meet their product requirements throughout the entire product life cycle.
866374_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Over the past few years, we have seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, primarily in the technology sector.
866374_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Some companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, Internet service providers or e-commerce retailers have entered the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology hardware markets, such as mobile devices, home entertainment and wearable devices.
866374_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	This trend has resulted in a significant change in the manufacturing and supply chain solutions requirements of such companies.
866374_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	While the products have become more complex, the supply chain solutions required by such companies have become more customized and demanding, and it has changed the manufacturing and supply chain landscape significantly.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	We use a portfolio approach to manage our extensive service offerings.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	As our customers change the way they go to market, we have the capability to reorganize and rebalance our business portfolio in order to align with our customers' needs and requirements in an effort to optimize operating results.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	The objective of our business model is to allow us to be flexible and redeploy and reposition our assets and resources as necessary to meet specific customer's supply chain solutions needs across all the markets we serve and earn a return on our invested capital above the weighted average cost of that capital.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	During the past several years, we have evolved our long-term portfolio towards a mix of businesses which possess longer product life cycles and higher segment operating margins such as reflected in our IEI and HRS businesses.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S4	Since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, we launched several programs broadly across our portfolio of services and in some instances we deployed certain new technologies.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S5	We continue to invest in innovation and we have expanded our design and engineering relationships through our product innovation centers.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S6	We believe that our continued business transformation is strategically positioning us to take advantage of the long-term, future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities, design and engineering services and after-market services, which remain strong.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S7	We are one of the world's largest providers of global supply chain solutions, with revenues of $25.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 .
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S8	We have established an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world's major consumer and enterprise markets (Asia, the Americas, and Europe) to serve the growing outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional customers.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S9	We design, build, ship, and service consumer and enterprise products for our customers through a network of over 100 facilities in approximately 35 countries across four continents.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S10	As of March 31, 2018 , our total manufacturing capacity was approximately 28 million square feet.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S11	In fiscal year 2018 , our net sales in Asia, the Americas and Europe represented approximately 44% , 39% and 17% , respectively, of our total net sales, based on the location of the manufacturing site.
866374_18_ITEM7_P4_S12	The following tables set forth net sales and net property and equipment, by country, based on the location of our manufacturing sites and the relative percentages:
866374_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	We believe that the combination of our extensive open innovation platform solutions, design and engineering services, advanced supply chain management solutions and services, significant scale and global presence, and manufacturing campuses in low-cost geographic areas provide us with a competitive advantage and strong differentiation in the market for designing, manufacturing and servicing consumer and enterprise products for leading multinational and regional customers.
866374_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Specifically, we have launched multiple product innovation centers ("PIC") focused exclusively on offering our customers the ability to simplify their global product development, manufacturing process, and after sales services, and enable them to meaningfully accelerate their time to market and cost savings.
866374_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including the following:
866374_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	changes in trade regulations and treaties.
866374_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We also are subject to other risks as outlined in Item 1A, "Risk Factors".
866374_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net sales for fiscal year 2018 increased 7% or $1.6 billion to $25.4 billion from the prior year.
866374_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	The increase was primarily due to a $1.0 billion increase in our IEI segment, as well as $0.6 billion increases in each of our HRS and CTG segments, partially offset by a $0.7 billion decrease in our CEC segment.
866374_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Our fiscal year 2018 gross profit totaled $1.6 billion , representing an increase of $75 million , or 4.9% , from the prior year, which is primarily due to contribution flow through from the additional $1.6 billion in sales from the prior year, offset by restructuring charges of $67 million included in cost of sales in fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	Our net income totaled $429 million , representing an increase of $109 million , or 34% , compared to fiscal year 2017 .
866374_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	with the recognition of a $152 million gain from the deconsolidation of our subsidiary, Elementum SCM (Cayman) Ltd ("Elementum"), and a $39 million gain from sale of Wink Labs Inc. ("Wink").
866374_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Refer to note 6 and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for details of the deconsolidation of Elementum and the disposition of Wink, respectively.
866374_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Cash provided by operations decreased by approximately $0.3 billion to $0.8 billion for fiscal years 2018 compared with $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2017 primarily due to unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our average net working capital, defined as accounts receivable, including the deferred purchase price receivables from our asset-backed securitization programs, plus inventory, less accounts payable, as a percentage of annualized sales decreased by 0.5% to 6.4% .
866374_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment, was $236 million for fiscal year 2018 compared to $660 million for fiscal year 2017 .
866374_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	The decrease in free cash flow is primarily due to lesser cash flows from operations and higher capital expenditures in fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for the free cash flows reconciliation to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of cash flows from operations.
866374_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Cash used in investing activities increased by approximately $0.2 billion to $0.9 billion for fiscal year 2018 , compared with $0.7 billion for fiscal year 2017 , primarily due to an increase in the amount of cash paid for acquired businesses during fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Cash used in financing activities totaled $188 million during fiscal year 2018 , which decreased $54 million from $242 million in the prior year, primarily due to a lower level of repurchases of ordinary shares.
866374_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Additionally, in fiscal year 2018, the Company initiated targeted restructuring activities, focused on optimizing our cost structure in lower growth areas and, more importantly, streamlining certain corporate and segment functions.
866374_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	The objective of the plan is to make Flex a faster, more responsive and agile company, better positioned to react to marketplace opportunities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	During the year ended March 31, 2018, we recognized $91 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, comprised of $79 million of cash charges predominantly related to severance costs and $12 million of non-cash charges primarily related to asset impairment and other exit charges.
866374_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Audit Committee Investigation Completed As previously disclosed, the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the Audit Committee ), with the assistance of independent outside counsel, undertook an independent investigation relating to the accounting treatment of customer obligations and certain related reserves.
866374_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	The independent outside counsel also notified the SEC.
866374_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The Audit Committee has now completed its investigation.
866374_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	The Company, working with its independent registered public accounting firm, identified and the Audit Committee concurred with such identification, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.
866374_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	Notwithstanding the identification of such material weaknesses, management believes that the Company s financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of, and for the periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
866374_18_ITEM7_P13_S4	The conclusions of management, with which the Audit Committee concurred, concerning the material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting are described further in Item 9A Controls and Procedures .
866374_18_ITEM7_P13_S5	We have undertaken, and will continue to undertake, steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting to address and remediate the material weaknesses.
866374_18_ITEM7_P13_S6	The proposed plan to remediate the material weaknesses is described further in Item 9A Controls and Procedures .
866374_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
866374_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
866374_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
866374_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	We recognize manufacturing revenue when we ship goods or the goods are received by our customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured.
866374_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Generally, there are no formal substantive customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services.
866374_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	If such requirements or obligations exist, then we recognize the related revenues at the time when such requirements are completed, and the obligations are fulfilled.
866374_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Some of our customer contracts allow the recovery of certain costs related to manufacturing services that are over and above the prices charged for the related products.
866374_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	Also, certain customer contracts may contain certain commitments and obligations that may result in additional expenses or decrease in revenue.
866374_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	Refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further details.
866374_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	We have an established customer credit policy through which we manage customer credit exposures through credit evaluations, credit limit setting, monitoring, and enforcement of credit limits for new and existing customers.
866374_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and make provisions for doubtful accounts based on the outcome of those credit evaluations.
866374_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances, current economic trends, historical experience with collections and the age of past due receivables.
866374_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	To the extent we identify exposures as a result of customer credit issues, we also review other customer related exposures, including but not limited to inventory and related contractual obligations.
866374_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	On April 21, 2016, SunEdison, Inc. (together with certain of its subsidiaries, "SunEdison"), filed a petition for reorganization under bankruptcy law.
866374_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we recognized a bad debt reserve charge of $61 million associated with our outstanding SunEdison receivables and accepted return of previously shipped inventory of approximately $90 million.
866374_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, prices for solar panel modules declined significantly.
866374_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	We determined that certain solar panel inventory previously designated for SunEdison on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 was not fully recoverable and recorded a charge of $60 million to reduce the carrying costs to market during fiscal year 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	In addition, we recognized a $16 million impairment charge for solar module equipment and incurred $17 million of incremental costs primarily related to negative margin sales and other associated solar panel direct costs.
866374_18_ITEM7_P19_S5	The total charge of $93 million is included in cost of sales for fiscal year 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Restructuring Charges We recognize restructuring charges related to our plans to close or consolidate excess manufacturing facilities and rationalize administrative functions and to realign our corporate cost structure.
866374_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	In connection with these activities, we recognize restructuring charges for employee termination costs, long-lived asset impairment and other exit-related costs.
866374_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	The recognition of these restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned restructuring activity.
866374_18_ITEM7_P20_S3	To the extent our actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized.
866374_18_ITEM7_P20_S4	Such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
866374_18_ITEM7_P20_S5	At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.
866374_18_ITEM7_P20_S6	Refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Inventory Valuation Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value.
866374_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short-term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand.
866374_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	We purchase our inventory based on forecasted demand, and we estimate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand, and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers.
866374_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	If actual market conditions or our customers' product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional write downs may be required.
866374_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	In addition, unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers and/or changes in economic conditions may require additional write downs for inventories due to our customers' inability to fulfill their contractual obligations with regards to inventory procured to fulfill customer demand.
866374_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Valuation of Private Company Investments We assess our cost method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired.
866374_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	factors that raise significant concerns about the investee s ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operation or working capital deficiencies.
866374_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	The carrying value of certain of our investments are individually material, thus there is the potential for material charges in future periods if we determine that those investments are impaired.
866374_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets We review property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
866374_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of these long-lived assets exceeds their fair value.
866374_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Recoverability of property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets are measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
866374_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets exceeds fair value.
866374_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our judgments regarding projected cash flows for an extended period of time and the fair value of assets may be impacted by changes in market conditions, general business environment and other factors.
866374_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	To the extent our estimates relating to cash flows and fair value of assets change adversely we may have to recognize additional impairment charges in the future.
866374_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
866374_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors, market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis.
866374_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	The Company performed its goodwill impairment assessment on January 1, 2018 and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test because the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
866374_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	We may be exposed to certain liabilities relating to our business operations, acquisitions of businesses and assets and other activities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	We make provisions for such liabilities when it is probable that the settlement of the liability will result in an outflow of economic resources or the impairment of an asset.
866374_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	We make these assessments based on facts and circumstances that may change in the future resulting in additional expenses.
866374_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	Refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our contingent liabilities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Income Taxes Our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, which will result in deductible amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards.
866374_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	Based on estimates, the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize these deferred income tax assets.
866374_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors.
866374_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets previously recognized, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.
866374_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_18_ITEM7_P28_S5	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_18_ITEM7_P28_S6	Refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our tax position.
866374_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales.
866374_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	The data below, and discussion that follows, represents our results from operations.
866374_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net sales Net sales during fiscal year 2018 totaled $25.4 billion , representing an increase of $1.5 billion, or 7% , from $23.9 billion during fiscal year 2017 .
866374_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	The overall increase in sales was driven by increases in three of our segments offset by a decline in sales in our CEC segment.
866374_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	During fiscal year 2018 , the increase in net sales was primarily driven by an increase of $1.3 billion in the Americas and to a lesser extent, $0.2 billion in Asia with Europe remaining relatively consistent in fiscal year 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P30_S3	Net sales during fiscal year 2017 totaled $23.9 billion , representing a decrease of $0.5 billion, or 2% , from $24.4 billion during fiscal year 2016 .
866374_18_ITEM7_P30_S4	During fiscal year 2017 , net sales decreased $0.8 billion in Asia, while increasing $0.2 billion in the Americas, and $36 million in Europe.
866374_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	The following table sets forth net sales by segments and their relative percentages.
866374_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	Historical information has been recast to reflect realignment of customers and/or products between segments:
866374_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2018 increased $1.0 billion or 20% in our IEI segment, which was mainly driven by our industrial, home and lifestyle businesses in addition to growth in our solar energy business.
866374_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Our CTG segment increased $0.6 billion or 10% largely attributable to stronger sale in our connected living and mobile devices businesses, offset by a decrease in gaming.
866374_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	Our HRS segment increased $0.6 billion or 15% from higher sales in our automotive business.
866374_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 billion or 8% in our CEC segment, largely attributable to lower sales within our telecom and networking businesses, offset by increased sales in our cloud and data center business.
866374_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Net sales during fiscal year 2017 decreased $0.6 billion or 9% in the CTG segment and $0.5 billion or 5% in the CEC segment.
866374_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The decline in sales for CTG was primarily due to a decline in demand from our largest smartphone customer, Lenovo/Motorola, in connection with our exit of a China operation dedicated to this customer, partially offset by revenues from our Bose acquisition, as well as ramping of a broad mix of customers.
866374_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	The decrease in CEC is largely attributable to lower sales within our legacy server and storage business.
866374_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	These decreases were partially offset by a $287 million or 6% increase in sales from our IEI segment driven by contribution from our NEXTracker Inc. ("NEXTracker") acquisition and expansion within our capital equipment business, and by a $250 million or 6% increase in sales from our HRS segment primarily driven by our automotive business.
866374_18_ITEM7_P33_S4	Our ten largest customers during fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 accounted for approximately 41% , 43% and 46% of net sales, respectively.
866374_18_ITEM7_P33_S5	We have made substantial efforts toward the diversification of our portfolio which allows us to operate at scale in many different industries, and, as a result, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in fiscal year 2018 and 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P33_S6	During fiscal year 2016 , only Lenovo/Motorola, which is reflected in our CTG segment, accounted for greater than 10% of net sales.
866374_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Gross profit Gross profit is affected by a number of factors, including the number, size and complexity of new manufacturing programs, product mix, component costs and availability, product life cycles, unit volumes, pricing, competition, new product introductions, capacity utilization, and the expansion and consolidation of manufacturing facilities including specific restructuring activities from time to time.
866374_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	The flexible design of our manufacturing processes allows us to build a broad range of products in our facilities and better utilize our manufacturing capacity across our diverse geographic footprint.
866374_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	In the cases of new programs, profitability normally lags revenue growth due to product start-up costs, lower manufacturing program volumes in the start-up phase, operational inefficiencies, and under-absorbed overhead.
866374_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Gross margin for these programs often improves over time as manufacturing volumes increase, as our utilization rates and overhead absorption improve, and as we increase the level of manufacturing services content.
866374_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	As a result of these various factors, our gross margin varies from period to period.
866374_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Gross profit during fiscal year 2018 increased $75 million to $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion during fiscal year 2017 , primarily as a result of the increase in revenue offset by $67 million , or 30 basis points, of restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Gross margin decreased 10 basis points, to 6.2% of net sales in fiscal year 2018 , from 6.3% of net sales in fiscal year 2017 , mainly attributable to the same factors previously described, coupled with elevated levels of investments in ramping new operations for our strategic footwear customer.
866374_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	Gross profit during fiscal year 2017 decreased $87 million to $1.5 billion from $1.6 billion during fiscal year 2016, primarily as a result of the $93 million, or 40 basis points, of charges recognized related to the significant decline in prices for solar modules and the slowdown in demand as previously discussed under our customer credit risk section, coupled with the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2017, to accelerate our ability to support more Sketch-to-Scaletm efforts across the Company.
866374_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	A portion of this decrease was offset by our strategic evolution and structural mix shift to higher margin end markets in our IEI and HRS segments, while also providing greater levels of innovation, design and engineering services.
866374_18_ITEM7_P37_S4	Gross margin decreased 30 basis points to 6.3% of net sales in fiscal year 2017, from 6.6% of net sales in fiscal year 2016, mainly attributable to the same factors previously described.
866374_18_ITEM7_P37_S5	In addition, we have been ramping several new programs this year along with the continued development of our long-term strategic partnership with a CTG customer which has negatively impacted our margins due to elevated investment costs and under-absorbed overhead.
866374_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	An operating segment's performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income.
866374_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	Segment income is defined as net sales, less cost of sales and segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, distressed customer charges, contingencies and other, restructuring charges, other charges (income), net and interest and other, net.
866374_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	A portion of depreciation is allocated to the respective segment together with other general corporate research and development and administrative expenses.
866374_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	The following table sets forth segment income and margins:
866374_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Corporate and other primarily includes corporate services costs that are not included in the CODM's assessment of the performance of each of the identified reporting segments.
866374_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	(1) During fiscal year 2016, we accepted return of previously shipped inventory from a former customer, SunEdison, Inc. ("SunEdison"), of approximately $90 million.
866374_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	On April 21, 2016, SunEdison filed a petition for reorganization under bankruptcy law, and as a result, we recognized a bad debt reserve of $61 million as of March 31, 2016, associated with our outstanding SunEdison receivables.
866374_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	During fiscal year 2017, prices for solar panel modules declined significantly.
866374_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	We determined that certain solar panel inventory on hand at the end of the fiscal year 2017 was not fully recoverable and recorded a charge of $60 million to reduce the carrying costs to market in fiscal year 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	We also recognized a $16 million impairment charge for solar module equipment and $17 million primarily related to negative margin sales and other associated direct costs.
866374_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	The total charge of $93 million is included in cost of sales for fiscal year 2017 but is excluded from segment results above.
866374_18_ITEM7_P41_S4	(2) The Company initiated restructuring plans in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and incurred charges primarily for employee terminations costs, as well as other asset impairments.
866374_18_ITEM7_P41_S5	These charges are split between cost of sales and selling, general and administration expenses on the Company's consolidated statement of operations, and are excluded from the measurement of the Company's operating segment's performance.
866374_18_ITEM7_P41_S6	Refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".
866374_18_ITEM7_P41_S7	(3) During fiscal year 2018, we incurred charges in connection with the matters described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for certain loss contingencies where we believe that losses are probable and estimable, coupled with various other charges predominately related to damages incurred from a typhoon that impacted one of our China facilities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P41_S8	Additionally, certain assets impairments were recorded during both fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	CEC segment margin decreased 30 basis points to 2.4% for fiscal year 2018 , from 2.7% during fiscal year 2017 .
866374_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	The decrease was driven by lower revenues which negatively impacted profitability with under-absorbed overhead and higher investment costs.
866374_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	CEC segment margin decreased 30 basis points to 2.7%, for fiscal year 2017, from 3.0% during fiscal year 2016.
866374_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	The decrease was driven by lower capacity utilization causing reduced overhead absorption, and pricing pressures coupled with incremental costs for proactive repositioning of certain programs and actions to better align CEC's operating structure.
866374_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	CTG segment margin decreased 120 basis points to 1.6% for fiscal year 2018 , from 2.8% during fiscal year 2017 , primarily driven by negatively impacted profits due to a lower contribution, and continued losses from our strategic partnership with a certain customer.
866374_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	CTG segment margin increased 50 basis points to 2.8% for fiscal year 2017, from 2.3% during fiscal year 2016, primarily driven by a portfolio shift within the CTG product mix with a greater concentration of higher margin products where we provide greater levels of design and engineering value-added content, as well as exiting of lower margin businesses and the benefit from a better-than-expected execution on certain products which were going end of life.
866374_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	IEI segment margin increased 30 basis points to 3.9% for fiscal year 2018 , from 3.6% during fiscal year 2017 .
866374_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	The improvement reflected strong revenue expansion which has been led by several new customer programs and an improving overall demand across its diverse market that has contributed to overhead absorption benefits.
866374_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	IEI segment margin increased 20 basis points to 3.6% for fiscal year 2017, from 3.4% during fiscal year 2016.
866374_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	This is primarily driven by new program ramps and demand increase in capital equipment and our household, industrial and lifestyle businesses, partially offset by underperformance from the loss of SunEdison, which was formerly our largest IEI customer and relatedly, from sales of solar panel inventory acquired from SunEdison in 2016.
866374_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	HRS segment margin decreased 10 basis point to 8.0% for fiscal year 2018 , from 8.1% during fiscal year 2017 .
866374_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The slight decrease reflects investments in expanding the segment's design and engineering capabilities, coupled with ramping up new customers and programs.
866374_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	HRS segment margin increased 50 basis points to 8.1% for fiscal year 2017, from 7.6% during fiscal year 2016.
866374_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	The improvements are primarily the result of new program launches and richer mix with greater value-added business engagements as a result of greater design and engineering solutions as part of our Sketch-to-Scale tm offering.
866374_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	During fiscal year 2018, we initiated targeted restructuring activities, focused on optimizing our cost structure in lower growth areas and, more importantly, streamlining certain corporate and segment functions.
866374_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	The objective of the plan is to make Flex a faster, more responsive and agile company, better positioned to react to marketplace opportunities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	We recognized $79 million of pre-tax cash charges, predominantly related to employee severance costs, and $12 million of pre-tax non-cash charges for asset impairment and other exit charges.
866374_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	The restructuring charges by geographic region were $64 million in the Americas, $17 million in Asia and $10 million in Europe.
866374_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	We classified $67 million of these charges as a component of cost of sales and $24 million as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	During fiscal year 2017, we initiated a restructuring plan to accelerate our ability to support more Sketch-to-Scale tm efforts across the Company and reposition away from historical legacy programs and structures through rationalizing our current footprint at existing sites including certain corporate SG A functions.
866374_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	We recognized $49 million of pre-tax restructuring charges predominantly for employee termination costs.
866374_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	The restructuring charges by geographic region were $28 million in the Americas, $15 million in Asia and $6 million in Europe.
866374_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	We classified $39 million of these charges as a component of cost of sales and $10 million as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.
866374_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	There were no material restructuring activities during fiscal years 2016.
866374_18_ITEM7_P48_S5	Refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") totaled $1.0 billion or 4.0% of net sales, during fiscal year 2018 , compared to $937 million , or 3.9% of net sales, during fiscal year 2017 , increasing by $82 million or 9% .
866374_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	This increase in SG A was due to incremental costs associated with our continued expansion of our design and engineering resources and innovation system but also, due to the recognition of certain contingencies that are probable and estimable of payout.
866374_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	Refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of litigation and other legal matters, which could impact our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition in future periods.
866374_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	We also incurred incremental costs from our acquisitions in fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	SG A totaled $937 million, or 3.9% of net sales, during fiscal year 2017, compared to $955 million, or 3.9% of net sales, during fiscal year 2016, decreasing by $18 million or 2%.
866374_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	The decrease in SG A in dollars is primarily the result of the nonrecurring $61 million bad debt reserve charge recognized in fiscal year 2016 as previously explained, offset by further investments in design and engineering resources by us to support our increased Sketch-to-Scale tm initiatives in fiscal year 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	We also incurred incremental costs associated with our targeted acquisitions in fiscal year 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal year 2018 decreased by $2 million to $79 million from $81 million in fiscal year 2017 , primarily as a result of certain intangible assets being fully amortized during fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal year 2017 increased by $15 million to $81 million from $66 million in fiscal year 2016, primarily as a result of incremental amortization expense on intangibles assets relating to our acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2017, as well as those completed in the second half of fiscal year 2016.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	Other charges (income), net During fiscal year 2018, we recognized $152 million of gain from the deconsolidation of Elementum, and $39 million of gain from the sale of Wink.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	Refer to note 6 and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for details of the deconsolidation of Elementum and the disposition of Wink, respectively.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	We also recorded $22 million related to the impairment of certain non-core investments during fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S5	No other components of other charges and income, net incurred during fiscal year 2018 were material.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S6	The fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 includes a $7 million loss attributable to a non-strategic facility sold during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S7	No other components of other charges and income, net incurred during fiscal year 2017 were material.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S8	During fiscal year 2016, we recognized other charges of $48 million primarily due to a $27 million loss on the disposition of a non-strategic Western European manufacturing facility which included a non-cash foreign currency translation loss of $25 million, and $22 million from the impairment of a non-core investment.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S9	Interest and other, net Interest and other, net was $123 million during fiscal year 2018 , compared to $100 million during fiscal year 2017 .
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S10	The increase in interest and other, net of $23 million was primarily due to a $15 million increase of interest expense from higher weighted average interest rates and a higher borrowing level.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S11	Interest and other, net was $100 million during fiscal year 2017, compared to $85 million during fiscal year 2016.
866374_18_ITEM7_P51_S12	The increase in interest and other, net of $15 million was primarily due to a $10 million increase of interest expense from the 4.750% Notes due June 15, 2025 and the Term Loan due November 2021, as further discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", and an $8 million decrease in foreign exchange gains, offset by $8 million of acquisition-related costs incurred during fiscal year 2016.
866374_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Income taxes The Company works to ensure it accrues and pays the appropriate amount of income taxes according to the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which it operates.
866374_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	Certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates.
866374_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	The consolidated effective tax rates were 17.7% , 13.8% and 2.3% for the fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	The effective rate varies from the Singapore statutory rate of 17.0% in each year as a result of the following items:
866374_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	The variation in our effective tax rate each year is primarily a result of recognition of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are taxed at rates lower than the Singapore statutory rate including the effect of tax holidays and tax incentives we received primarily for our subsidiaries in China, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Netherlands and Israel of $22 million , $16 million and $7 million in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Additionally, our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $22 million , $1 million , and ($14) million and changes in our valuation allowances on deferred tax assets of $297 million , $79 million and $1 million in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	We generate most of our revenues and profits from operations outside of Singapore.
866374_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	We are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions and around the world, and there can be no assurance that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
866374_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examinations, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
866374_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	We provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that in our estimation are not more likely than not to be realized.
866374_18_ITEM7_P55_S3	During fiscal year 2018, we released valuation allowances totaling $1 million primarily related to our operations in Taiwan, Mexico and Ireland as these amounts were deemed to be more likely than not to be realized due to the sustained profitability during the past three fiscal years as well as continued forecasted profitability of those subsidiaries.
866374_18_ITEM7_P55_S4	However, these valuation allowance eliminations were offset primarily by current period valuation allowance additions due to increased deferred tax assets as a result of current period losses in legal entities with existing full valuation allowance positions.
866374_18_ITEM7_P55_S5	In addition, due to increased negative evidence during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the Company added a valuation allowance of $365 million for a Brazilian subsidiary which did not previously have a valuation allowance recorded.
866374_18_ITEM7_P55_S6	Lastly, the Company released $705 million of valuation allowance to account for the reduced deferred tax asset as a result of the lower US corporate income tax rate which became effective January 1, 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P55_S7	During fiscal year 2018, the Company recognized an income tax receivable of $54 million for prior period taxes paid by one of its Brazilian subsidiaries which was deemed recoverable during the period.
866374_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Impact of the U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ) into law.
866374_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	Effective January 1, 2018, among other changes, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, provides for a deemed repatriation and taxation at reduced rates of certain non-US subsidiaries owned by U.S. companies historical earnings (a transition tax ), and establishes new mechanisms to tax such earnings going forward.
866374_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Similar to other large multinational companies with complex tax structures, the Act has wide ranging implications for Flex.
866374_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	However, the impact on Flex's financial statements for the twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2018 is immaterial, primarily because the Company has a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S., which results in there being no U.S. deferred tax assets or liabilities recorded on the balance sheet that need to be remeasured at the new 21% rate.
866374_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	Further, the Company expects that the new transition tax will be offset by foreign tax credits or net operating loss carryforwards, and thus will not result in any incremental taxes payable.
866374_18_ITEM7_P57_S3	The Company will continue to analyze the effects of the Act on its financial statements and operations.
866374_18_ITEM7_P57_S4	Any additional impacts from the enactment of the Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period provided for in Staff Bulletin 118.
866374_18_ITEM7_P57_S5	See note 14, "Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion.
866374_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of March 31, 2018 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion and bank and other borrowings of $2.9 billion .
866374_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	We have a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility that is due to mature in June 2022, under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2018 .
866374_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world.
866374_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	As of March 31, 2018 , over half of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries outside of Singapore.
866374_18_ITEM7_P58_S4	Although substantially all of the amounts held outside of Singapore could be repatriated, under current laws, a significant amount could be subject to income tax withholdings.
866374_18_ITEM7_P58_S5	We provide for tax liabilities on these amounts for financial statement purposes, except for certain of our foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Singapore (approximately $1.6 billion as of March 31, 2018 ).
866374_18_ITEM7_P58_S6	Repatriation could result in an additional income tax payment; however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of Singapore and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our operations in jurisdictions outside of where they are held.
866374_18_ITEM7_P58_S7	Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of Singapore and we would meet our liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both.
866374_18_ITEM7_P58_S8	Fiscal Year 2018 Cash provided by operating activities was $0.8 billion during fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P58_S9	This resulted primarily from $429 million of net income for the period plus $478 million of non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, net of a gain from the deconsolidation of Elementum that are included in the determination of net income.
866374_18_ITEM7_P58_S10	Depreciation expense was $434 million of those non-cash charges which is relatively consistent with our normal annual run rate.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	in accounts receivable, including the change in sales of accounts receivable, offset by a $623 million increase in accounts payable and a $13 million increase in other current and noncurrent liabilities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	Net working capital ("NWC"), defined as net accounts receivable, including deferred purchase price receivables, plus inventory less accounts payable decreased by $30 million .
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	Cash used in investing activities totaled $0.9 billion during fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S3	This resulted primarily from $214 million paid for the acquisition of AGM Automotive ("AGM") for our HRS segment, net of cash acquired, and $55 million paid for a power module business for our CEC segment, net of cash acquired.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S4	Further, we invested $517 million of net capital expenditures for property and equipment to expand capabilities and capacity in support of our automotive, medical, footwear and IEI businesses.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S5	In addition, other investing activities includes $73 million of cash of Elementum derecognized as of the date of deconsolidation, and $46 million of payments for non-core investments, net of cash received.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S6	Cash used in financing activities was $188 million during fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S7	This was primarily the result of repurchases of ordinary shares in the amount of $180 million , and the repayment of $55 million of debt, partially offset by $65 million received from third party investors in fiscal year 2018 in exchange for an additional noncontrolling equity interest in Elementum prior to the deconsolidation described above.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S8	Fiscal Year 2017 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion during fiscal year 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S9	This resulted primarily from $320 million of net income for the period plus $674 million of non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, other impairment charges, provision for doubtful accounts and stock-based compensation expense that are included in the determination of net income.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S10	Depreciation expense was $432 million of those non-cash charges, which was relatively consistent with our normal annual run rate.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S11	We generated $157 million in cash as a result of changes in our operating assets and liabilities, driven primarily by a $268 million increase in accounts payable, offset by a $184 million increase in accounts receivable, including the change in sales of accounts receivable.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S12	Cash used in investing activities was $0.7 billion during fiscal year 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S13	This resulted primarily from $490 million of net capital expenditures for property and equipment to expand capability and capacity in support of our automotive and medical businesses and further investments in both automation and expanding technologies to support our innovation services.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S14	We also paid $189 million for the acquisition of four businesses, net of cash acquired, including $162 million, net of $18 million of cash acquired related to the acquisition of manufacturing facilities from Bose.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S15	Further, $60 million was paid for a non-controlling interest in a joint venture with RIB Software AG as our partner.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S16	Offsetting this was proceeds from various other investing activities of $64 million, most notably the receipt of $38 million for the sale of two non-strategic businesses.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S17	Cash used in financing activities was $242 million during fiscal year 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S18	This was primarily the result of repurchases of ordinary shares in the amount $350 million, and $31 million of cash paid to a third-party banking institution for certain assets that were financed by the third party banking institution on behalf of a customer, which is included in other financing activities, as further discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S19	These cash outflows were partially offset by $171 million of net proceeds from bank borrowings and long-term debt, of which $130 million is the incremental amount borrowed extending the maturity date of one of our loan agreements from August 30, 2018 to November 30, 2021, and $107 million is the amount of proceeds from the 100 million term loan, discussed further in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S20	Fiscal Year 2016 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion during fiscal year 2016.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S21	This resulted primarily from $444 million of net income for the period plus $625 million of non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, other impairment charges, provision for doubtful accounts and stock-based compensation expense that are included in the determination of net income.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S22	Depreciation expense was $426 million of those non-cash charges, which was relatively consistent with our normal annual run rate.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S23	We generated $67 million in cash as a result of changes in our operating assets and liabilities, driven primarily by a $424 million reduction in accounts receivable, including the change in sales of accounts receivable, due to improved collection efforts and lower business levels, offset by a $365 million reduction in accounts payable.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S24	Cash used in investing activities was $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2016.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S25	This resulted primarily from $917 million for the acquisition of eleven businesses completed during fiscal year 2016, including approximately $555 million, net of cash acquired, related to the acquisition of MCi, $241 million, net of cash acquired, related to the acquisition of NEXTracker, and approximately $68 million to acquire an optical transport facility from Alcatel-Lucent.
866374_18_ITEM7_P59_S26	We also paid $511 million in gross capital expenditures for property and equipment to support certain programs, offset by $14 million of proceeds from the sale of certain buildings and machinery and equipment.
866374_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	certain investments, offset by $54 million of proceeds from the sale of certain assets that were purchased on behalf of a customer and financed by a third party banking institution included in other investing activities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	Cash provided by financing activities was $250 million during fiscal year 2016, which was primarily the result of net proceeds from bank borrowings and long-term debt of $695 million mainly resulting from our new debt issuance discussed further in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", and $61 million from the issuance of our shares for option exercises.
866374_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	These cash inflows were partially offset by $420 million of cash paid for the repurchase of our ordinary shares, and $75.8 million of cash paid to a third party banking institution for certain assets that were financed by the third party banking institution on behalf of a customer, which is included in other financing activities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repurchase company shares, fund acquisitions, make investments, repay debt obligations, and for certain other activities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	Our free cash flow, which is calculated as cash provided by operations less net purchases of property and equipment, was $236 million , $660 million and $639 million for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.
866374_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	Free cash flows reconcile to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of cash flows from operations as follows:
866374_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets.
866374_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world.
866374_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances; however, any current restrictions are not material.
866374_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout the global organization.
866374_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	We believe that our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months.
866374_18_ITEM7_P64_S4	Future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, the timing of capital expenditures for new equipment, the extent to which we utilize operating leases for new facilities and equipment, and the levels of shipments and changes in the volumes of customer orders.
866374_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Historically, we have funded operations from cash and cash equivalents generated from operations, proceeds from public offerings of equity and debt securities, bank debt and lease financings.
866374_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	We also sell a designated pool of trade receivables under asset-backed securitization ("ABS") programs and sell certain trade receivables, which are in addition to the trade receivables sold in connection with these securitization agreements.
866374_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	During fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we received approximately $9.4 billion , $8.6 billion and $7.0 billion , respectively from transfers of receivables under our ABS programs, and $1.5 billion , $1.3 billion and $2.3 billion , respectively from other sales of receivables.
866374_18_ITEM7_P65_S3	As of March 31, 2018 and 2017 , the outstanding balance on receivables sold for cash was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion , for each year respectively, under all our accounts receivable sales programs, which are removed from accounts receivable balances in our consolidated balance sheets.
866374_18_ITEM7_P65_S4	We anticipate that we will enter into debt and equity financings, sales of accounts receivable and lease transactions to fund acquisitions and anticipated growth.
866374_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	The sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current shareholders.
866374_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	Further, we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations and could increase debt service obligations.
866374_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	This increased indebtedness could limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, potentially affect our credit ratings, and may limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy.
866374_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	our ability to borrow as a result of more restrictive borrowing terms.
866374_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	We continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase ordinary shares.
866374_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Historically we have been successful in refinancing and extending the maturity dates on our term loans and credit facilities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	In June 2017, the Company entered into a five-year credit facility consisting of a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility and a $503 million term loan, which is due to mature on June 30, 2022 (the "2022 Credit Facility").
866374_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	This 2022 Credit Facility replaced the Company's $2.1 billion credit facility, which was due to mature in March 2019.
866374_18_ITEM7_P68_S3	The outstanding principal of the term loan portion of the 2022 Credit Facility is repayable in quarterly installments of approximately $6 million from September 30, 2017 through June 30, 2020 and approximately $13 million from September 30, 2020 through March 31, 2022 with the remainder due upon maturity.
866374_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Under our current share repurchase program, our Board of Directors authorized repurchases of our outstanding ordinary shares for up to $500 million in accordance with the share purchase mandate approved by our shareholders at the date of the most recent Annual General Meeting which was held on August 15, 2017.
866374_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	During fiscal year 2018 , we paid $180 million to repurchase shares (under the current and prior repurchase plans) at an average price of $16.63 per share.
866374_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	As of March 31, 2018 , shares in the aggregate amount of $410 million were available to be repurchased under the current plan.
866374_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Bank borrowings and long-term debt are as follows:
866374_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Refer to the discussion in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further details of our debt obligations.
866374_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	We have purchase obligations that arise in the normal course of business, primarily consisting of binding purchase orders for inventory related items and capital expenditures.
866374_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Additionally, we have leased certain of our property and equipment under capital lease commitments, and certain of our facilities and equipment under operating lease commitments.
866374_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Future payments due under our purchase obligations, debt including capital leases and related interest obligations and operating leases are as follows:
866374_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	We have excluded $228 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from the contractual obligations table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the periodic settlements with the respective taxing authorities.
866374_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	See note 14, "Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further details.
866374_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements.
866374_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	We intend to use our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations to fund our existing and future contractual obligations.
866374_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We sell designated pools of trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions under our ABS programs, and in addition to cash, we receive a deferred purchase price receivable for each pool of the receivables sold.

866374_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio, which consists of highly liquid investments or bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from original dates of purchase and are classified as cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

866374_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Our investment policy has strict guidelines focusing on preservation of capital.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The portfolio is comprised of various instruments including term deposits with banks, marketable securities and money market accounts.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our cash is principally invested in the U.S. dollar and China RMB serving as a natural hedge of our RMB denominated costs.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of March 31, 2018 , the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was $0.5 billion , the largest components of which were Brazilian real, China renminbi and Indian rupee denominated money market accounts with an average return of 3.86% .

866374_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We had variable rate debt outstanding of approximately $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2018 .
866374_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Variable rate debt obligations consisted of borrowings under our term loans.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Interest on these obligations is discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".
866374_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our variable rate debt instruments create exposures for us related to interest rate risk.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Primarily due to the current low interest rates, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As of March 31, 2018 , the approximate average fair value of our debt outstanding under our term loan facilities that mature in November 2021 and June 2022, and Notes due February 2020, February 2023 and June 2025 was 102.5% of the face value of the debt obligations based on broker trading prices.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	We have established a foreign currency risk management policy to manage this risk.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	To the extent possible, we manage our foreign currency exposure by evaluating and using non-financial techniques, such as currency of invoice, leading and lagging payments and receivables management.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P6_S3	In addition, we may borrow in various foreign currencies and enter into short-term foreign currency derivative contracts, including forward, swap, and option contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities, mainly accounts receivable and accounts payable, and cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P6_S4	We endeavor to maintain a partial or fully hedged position for certain transaction exposures.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P6_S5	These exposures are primarily, but not limited to, revenues, customer and vendor payments and inter-company balances in currencies other than the functional currency unit of the operating entity.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P6_S6	The credit risk of our foreign currency derivative contracts is minimized since all contracts are with large financial institutions and accordingly, fair value adjustments related to the credit risk of the counter-party financial institution were not material.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The gains and losses on foreign currency derivative contracts generally offset the losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and transactions hedged.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The fair value of currency derivative contracts is reported on the balance sheet.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts as of March 31, 2018 amounted to $7.6 billion and the recorded fair values of the associated assets and liabilities were not material.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The majority of these foreign exchange contracts expire in less than three months and all expire within one year.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P8_S1	They will settle primarily in the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, China renminbi, Euro, Hungarian forint, Israeli shekel, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and U.S. dollar.
866374_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Based on our overall currency rate exposures as of March 31, 2018 , including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and cash flows, and other factors a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar from its cross-functional rates would not be expected, in the aggregate, to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the near-term.

866374_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
866374_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	Recoverability of property and equipment is determined by comparing its carrying amount to the lowest level of identifiable projected undiscounted cash flows the property and equipment are expected to generate.
866374_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of property and equipment exceeds its fair value.
866374_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Deferred Income Taxes The Company provides for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
866374_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities by applying the applicable statutory tax rate to such differences.
866374_18_ITEM8_P35_S2	Additionally, the Company assesses whether each income tax position is "more likely than not" of being sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation, if any.
866374_18_ITEM8_P35_S3	For each income tax position that meets the "more likely than not" recognition threshold, the Company would then assess the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon effective settlement with the tax authority.
866374_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company has actively pursued business and asset acquisitions, which are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
866374_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	The fair value of the net assets acquired and the results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the acquisition dates forward.
866374_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and results of operations during the reporting period.
866374_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, the fair value of acquired net operating assets, property and equipment, intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities, useful lives of plant and equipment and amortizable lives for acquired intangible assets.
866374_18_ITEM8_P37_S2	Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identified assets and liabilities acquired is recognized as goodwill.
866374_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company estimates the preliminary fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition based on information available at that time.
866374_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the date of the acquisition with subsequent adjustments recorded in earnings.
866374_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	Changes to valuation allowances on acquired deferred tax assets are recognized in the provision for, or benefit from, income taxes.
866374_18_ITEM8_P38_S3	The valuation of these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities is subject to further management review and may change materially between the preliminary allocation and end of the purchase price allocation period.
866374_18_ITEM8_P38_S4	Any changes in these estimates may have a material effect on the Company's consolidated operating results or financial position.
866374_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
866374_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors, market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis.
866374_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	If the recorded value of the assets, including goodwill, and liabilities ("net book value") of any reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss may be required to be recognized.
866374_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	Further, to the extent the net book value of the Company as a whole is greater than its fair value in the aggregate, all, or a significant portion of its goodwill may be considered impaired.
866374_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company has four reporting units, which correspond to its four reportable operating segments: HRS, CTG, IEI and CEC.
866374_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	The Company concluded that there was no change to its reporting units in fiscal year 2018 and performed its goodwill impairment assessment on January 1, 2018 .
866374_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	The Company bypassed the qualitative "Step Zero" assessment and performed a quantitative assessment of its goodwill and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test because the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

866374_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	If such requirements or obligations exist, then the Company recognizes the related revenues at the time when such requirements are completed, and the obligations are fulfilled.
866374_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	Some of the Company's customer contracts allow the recovery of certain costs related to manufacturing services that are over and above the prices charged for the related products.
866374_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	The Company determines the amount of costs that are recoverable based on agreements with those customers.
866374_18_ITEM8_P73_S2	Also, certain customer contracts contain commitments and obligations that may result in additional expenses or decreases in revenue.

866374_18_ITEM8_P73_S6	Provisions for sales returns were not material to the consolidated financial statements for any of the periods presented.
866374_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company provides a comprehensive suite of services for its customers that range from advanced product design to manufacturing and logistics to after-sales services.

866374_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	Transition to ASC 606 ASU 2014-09 Revenue Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) establishes a comprehensive framework for determining the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer.
866374_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	Upon adoption of the new guidance, effective April 1, 2018 for Flex, the timing of revenue recognition for a portion of the Company s business will change, resulting in the recognition of revenue for certain of the Company s manufacturing services customer contracts earlier than under the previous recognition rules.
866374_18_ITEM8_P76_S2	Refer to note 2 for further detail about the impact to the Company upon adoption.
866374_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company generally enters into master supply agreements ( MSA ) with its customers that provide the framework under which business will be conducted.
866374_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	This includes matters such as warranty, indemnification, transfer of title and risk of loss, liability for excess and obsolete inventory, pricing formulas, payment terms, etc.
866374_18_ITEM8_P77_S2	On occasion, the level of business under those agreements is not guaranteed.
866374_18_ITEM8_P77_S3	In those instances, we bid on a program-by-program basis and typically receive customer purchase orders for specific quantities and timing of products.
866374_18_ITEM8_P77_S4	As a result, the Company considers its contract with a customer to be the combination of the MSA and the purchase order, or any other similar documents such as a statement of work that embody the commitment by the customer.
866374_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Certain of the Company s customer agreements include terms that result in potential price adjustments.
866374_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	These price adjustments include, but are not limited to, sharing of cost savings, committed price reductions, material margins earned over the period that are contractually restricted to be paid to the customers, rebates, refunds tied to performance metrics such as on-time delivery, and other periodic pricing resets that may be refundable to customers.
866374_18_ITEM8_P78_S2	The Company accrues for these contractual provisions as a reduction of revenues when incurred which generally approximates the same time that revenue for the portion of the arrangement that is not subject to such price adjustments is recognized.
866374_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company determines the amounts to be accrued based on the amount of potential refund required by the contract, where applicable, historical experience and other surrounding facts and circumstances.
866374_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	Often these obligations are settled with the customer in a period after shipment through various methods which include reduction of prices in future purchases, issuance of a payment to the customer, or issuance of a credit note applied against the customer s accounts receivable balance.
866374_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	In some instances, the agreement might be silent on the settlement mechanism.
866374_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	agreed to with the customer is recorded as an increase or decrease in revenue.
866374_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	These potential price adjustments are included as part of other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, and disclosed as part of customer related accruals in note 2.
866374_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	Refer to note 2 for further details about other current liabilities.
866374_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Equity Compensation Plans Historically, the Company's primary plan used for granting equity compensation awards was the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan").
866374_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	Effective August 15, 2017, awards are granted under the Company's 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2017 Plan"), which was approved by the Company's shareholders at the 2017 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, to replace the 2010 Plan for further grants.
866374_18_ITEM8_P82_S2	For additional discussion about the 2017 Plan, refer to the Company's Proxy Statement, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 5, 2017.
866374_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	During fiscal year 2016, in conjunction with the acquisition of NEXTracker, the Company assumed all of the outstanding, unvested share bonus awards and outstanding, unvested options to purchase shares of common stock of NEXTracker, and converted all these shares into Flex awards.
866374_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	As a result, the Company now maintains the 2014 NEXTracker Equity Incentive Plan (the "NEXTracker Plan").
866374_18_ITEM8_P83_S2	Additionally, during fiscal year 2017, in conjunction with an immaterial acquisition, the Company assumed all of the outstanding, unvested options to purchase shares of common stock of the acquiree, and converted all of these shares into Flex awards.
866374_18_ITEM8_P83_S3	As a result, the Company now maintains an additional equity compensation plan, the BrightBox Technologies 2013 Plan (the "BrightBox Plan").
866374_18_ITEM8_P83_S4	The BrightBox Plan is immaterial to the Company for all periods presented.
866374_18_ITEM8_P83_S5	As a result of the deconsolidation of Elementum during fiscal year 2018, the Company no longer grants equity compensation awards under the 2013 Elementum Plan.
866374_18_ITEM8_P83_S6	Refer to note 6 for additional information on the deconsolidation.
866374_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense for all Equity Incentive Plans:
866374_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	Cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits (tax benefits related to the excess of proceeds from employee exercises of share options over the share-based compensation cost recognized for those options) are classified as operating cash flows.
866374_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	During fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company did not recognize any excess tax benefits as an operating cash inflow.
866374_18_ITEM8_P85_S2	The 2017 Equity Incentive Plan As of March 31, 2018 , the Company had approximately 22.2 million shares available for grant under the 2017 Plan.
866374_18_ITEM8_P85_S3	Options issued to employees under the 2017 Plan generally vest over four years and expire ten years from the date of grant.
866374_18_ITEM8_P85_S4	Options granted to non-employee directors expire five years from the date of grant.
866374_18_ITEM8_P85_S5	The exercise price of options granted to employees is determined by the Company's Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and may not be less than the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant.
866374_18_ITEM8_P85_S6	As of March 31, 2018 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share options granted to employees under the 2017 Plan was not significant and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately six months .
866374_18_ITEM8_P85_S7	The Company also grants share bonus awards under its equity compensation plan.
866374_18_ITEM8_P85_S8	Share bonus awards are rights to acquire a specified number of ordinary shares for no cash consideration in exchange for continued service with the Company.
866374_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	Share bonus awards generally vest in installments over a three to five -year period and unvested share bonus awards are forfeited upon termination of employment.
866374_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	Vesting for certain share bonus awards is contingent upon both service and market conditions.
866374_18_ITEM8_P86_S2	Further, vesting for certain share bonus awards granted to certain executive officers is contingent upon meeting certain free cash flow targets.
866374_18_ITEM8_P86_S3	As of March 31, 2018 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share bonus awards granted to employees was approximately $134.2 million under the 2017 Plan.
866374_18_ITEM8_P86_S4	These costs will be amortized generally on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.
866374_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	Approximately $14.2 million of the unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2017 Plan is related to share bonus awards granted to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting a certain market condition.
866374_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	Determining Fair Value - Options and share bonus awards Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share options granted under the 2017 and 2010 Plans using the Black-Scholes valuation method and a single option award approach.
866374_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
866374_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	The fair market value of share bonus awards granted, other than those awards with a market condition, is the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant and is generally recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.
866374_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	Expected Term The Company's expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation method represents the period that the Company's share options are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share options, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its share options.
866374_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	Expected Volatility The Company's expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes valuation method is derived from a combination of implied volatility related to publicly traded options to purchase Flex ordinary shares and historical variability in the Company's periodic share price.
866374_18_ITEM8_P89_S2	Expected Dividend The Company has never paid dividends on its ordinary shares and accordingly the dividend yield percentage is zero for all periods.
866374_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury constant maturities issued with a term equivalent to the expected term of the option.
866374_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	There were no options granted under the 2017 and 2010 Plans during fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .
866374_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	Determining Fair Value - Share bonus awards with service and market conditions Valuation and Amortization Method The Company estimates the fair value of share bonus awards granted under the 2017 and 2010 Plans whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions using Monte Carlo simulation.
866374_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is the service period.
866374_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	Expected volatility of Flex Volatility used in a Monte Carlo simulation is derived from the historical volatility of Flex's stock price over a period equal to the service period of the share bonus awards granted.
866374_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	The service period is three years for those share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .
866374_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	Average peer volatility Volatility used in a Monte Carlo simulation is derived from the historical volatilities of the Standard and Poor's ("S P") 500 index for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .
866374_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	Average Peer Correlation Correlation coefficients were used to model the movement of Flex's stock price relative to the S P 500 index for the share bonus awards granted in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .
866374_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	Expected Dividend and Risk-Free Interest Rate assumptions Same methodology as discussed above.
866374_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	The fair value of the Company's share-bonus awards under the 2017 and 2010 Plans, whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions, for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	The following is a summary of option activity for the Company's 2017 and 2010 Plans ("Price" reflects the weighted-average exercise price):
866374_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the Company's 2010 Plan (calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying award and the price of the Company's ordinary shares determined as of the time of option exercise for options exercised in-the-money) was $1.1 million , $9.3 million and $55.3 million during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P97_S1	Cash received from option exercises under the 2010 Plan was $1.1 million , $10.9 million and $61.1 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P97_S2	As of March 31, 2018 the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding, options vested and expected to vest, and options exercisable under the Company's 2017 and 2010 Plans were immaterial.
866374_18_ITEM8_P97_S3	The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company's ordinary shares as of March 31, 2018 for the immaterial amount of options that were in-the-money at March 31, 2018 .
866374_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's share bonus award activity under the 2017 and 2010 Plans ("Price" reflects the weighted-average grant-date fair value):
866374_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	(1) Included in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 amounts are 0.7 million and 1.7 million of share bonus awards, respectively, representing the number of awards achieved above target levels based on the achievement of certain market conditions, as further described in the table below.
866374_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	These awards were issued and immediately vested in accordance with the terms and conditions of the underlying awards.
866374_18_ITEM8_P100_S1	Of the 6.2 million unvested share bonus awards granted under the 2017 and 2010 Plans in fiscal year 2018 , approximately 4.7 million are plain-vanilla unvested share bonus awards with no performance or market conditions with an average grant date price of $16.57 per share.
866374_18_ITEM8_P100_S2	Further, approximately 0.2 million of these unvested share bonus awards have an average grant date price of $16.34 per share and represents the target amount of grants made to certain executive officers whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain free cash flow targets.
866374_18_ITEM8_P100_S3	These awards cliff vest after three years and will ultimately pay out over a range from zero up to a maximum of 0.4 million of the target payment based on a measurement of cumulative three -year increase of free cash flow from operations of the Company.
866374_18_ITEM8_P100_S4	Further, 0.6 million of these unvested share bonus awards granted in fiscal year 2018 represents the target amount of grants made to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on certain market conditions.
866374_18_ITEM8_P100_S5	The average grant date fair value of these awards contingent on certain market conditions was estimated to be $20.25 per award and was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation.
866374_18_ITEM8_P100_S6	Vesting information for these shares are further detailed in the table below.
866374_18_ITEM8_P100_S7	Finally, the remaining balance of 0.7 million represents the number of awards achieved above target levels, as described in the table above.
866374_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	Of the 13.9 million unvested share bonus awards outstanding under the 2017 and 2010 Plans as of the fiscal year ended 2018 , approximately 2.0 million of unvested share bonus awards represents the target amount of grants made to certain key employees whereby vesting is contingent on meeting certain market conditions summarized as follows:
866374_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	(1) Vesting ranges from zero to 200% based on measurement of Flex's total shareholder return against the Standard and Poor's ("S P") 500 Composite Index.
866374_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	The Company will recognize share-based compensation expense for awards with market conditions regardless of whether such awards will ultimately vest.
866374_18_ITEM8_P102_S2	During fiscal year 2018 , 1.4 million shares vested in connection with the share bonus awards with market conditions granted in fiscal year 2015.
866374_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	The total intrinsic value of share bonus awards vested under the Company's 2017 and 2010 Plans was $108.4 million , $109.5 million and $103.2 million during fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, based on the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares on the date vested.
866374_18_ITEM8_P103_S1	The 2014 NEXTracker Equity Incentive Plan All awards previously granted under the NEXTracker Plan are the result of the Company's conversion of all outstanding, unvested shares of NEXTracker into unvested shares of the Company, as part of the acquisition.
866374_18_ITEM8_P103_S2	During fiscal year 2018, the Company modified the vesting conditions of 0.3 million unvested options and 0.5 million share bonus awards under the NEXTracker Plan contingent on meeting certain performance targets.
866374_18_ITEM8_P103_S3	These options and share bonus awards were then re-granted to vest in installments over a three -year period commencing September 29, 2017.
866374_18_ITEM8_P103_S4	The Company determined that the transaction falls under the accounting for modification of awards, and accordingly adjusted the recognized compensation expense with an immaterial impact on the statement of operations for fiscal year 2018.
866374_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	Options issued to employees under the NEXTracker Plan generally have a vesting period of two to four years from vesting commencement date and expire ten years from the date of grant.
866374_18_ITEM8_P104_S1	The exercise price of options granted to employees was determined by the Company based on a conversion rate agreed upon in the purchase agreement of NEXTracker.
866374_18_ITEM8_P104_S2	As of March 31, 2018 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share options granted to employees under the NEXTracker Plan was $6.3 million and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.1 years.
866374_18_ITEM8_P104_S3	Share bonus awards issued to employees under the NEXTracker Plan vest in installments over a three to five -year period from vesting commencement date, and unvested share bonus awards are forfeited upon termination of employment.
866374_18_ITEM8_P104_S4	Vesting for certain of these share bonus awards is contingent on meeting certain performance targets over a three -year period commencing September 29, 2017, following the modification of vesting conditions described above.
866374_18_ITEM8_P104_S5	As of March 31, 2018 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share bonus awards granted to employees under the NEXTracker Plan was approximately $10.5 million and will be amortized generally on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.
866374_18_ITEM8_P104_S6	Determining Fair Value As noted above, the Company re-granted certain shares options under the NEXTracker Plan during fiscal year 2018 after modifying the vesting conditions.
866374_18_ITEM8_P104_S7	The fair value of share options granted under the NEXTracker Plan for fiscal years 2018 and 2016 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
866374_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	The following is a summary of option activity for the NEXTracker Plan ("Price" reflects the weighted-average exercise price):
866374_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the NEXTracker plan (calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying award and the price of the Company's ordinary shares determined as of the time of option exercise for options exercised in-the-money) was $7.3 million , $8.0 million and 2.3 million as of March 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016, respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P106_S1	Cash received from option exercises under the NEXTracker Plan was $1.7 million , $1.6 million and $0.2 million for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016, respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P106_S2	As of March 31, 2018 the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding, options vested and expected to vest, and options exercisable under the Company's NEXTracker Plan, were $13.6 million , $13.6 million , and $4.0 million , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P106_S3	The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company's ordinary shares as of March 31, 2018 for the approximately 1.1 million options under the NEXTracker Plan that were in-the-money at March 31, 2018 .
866374_18_ITEM8_P106_S4	The following table summarizes the Company's share bonus award activity under the NEXTracker Plan ("Price" reflects the weighted-average grant-date fair value):
866374_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	The total intrinsic value of share bonus awards vested under the Company's NEXTracker Plan was immaterial during fiscal year 2016.
866374_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the applicable periods.
866374_18_ITEM8_P108_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution from stock options and share bonus awards.
866374_18_ITEM8_P108_S2	The potential dilution from stock options exercisable into ordinary share equivalents and share bonus awards was computed using the treasury stock method based on the average fair market value of the Company's ordinary shares for the period.
866374_18_ITEM8_P108_S3	The following table reflects the basic weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding and diluted weighted-average ordinary share equivalents used to calculate basic and diluted income per share:
866374_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	(1) An immaterial amount of options to purchase ordinary shares during fiscal year 2018 were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive impact on the weighted average ordinary shares equivalents.
866374_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	Options to purchase ordinary shares of 0.5 million and 2.0 million during fiscal years 2017 and 2016 , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.
866374_18_ITEM8_P109_S2	Share bonus awards of less than 0.1 million during fiscal year 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive impact on the weighted average ordinary shares equivalents.
866374_18_ITEM8_P109_S3	There were no anti-dilutive share bonus awards in fiscal year 2016.
866374_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	NONCONTROLLING INTEREST AND DECONSOLIDATION OF SUBSIDIARY ENTITY Starting in fiscal year 2014, the Company had a majority owned subsidiary, Elementum SCM (Cayman) Ltd ("Elementum"), which qualified as a variable interest entity for accounting purposes.
866374_18_ITEM8_P110_S1	The Company owned a majority of Elementum' s outstanding equity (consisting primarily of preferred stock) and as of March 31, 2017, controlled its board of directors, which gave the Company the power to direct the activities of Elementum that most significantly impact its economic performance.
866374_18_ITEM8_P110_S2	Accordingly, the Company recognized the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest as a component of total shareholders' equity, and the consolidated financial statements included the financial position and results of operations of Elementum as of and for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.
866374_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company and other minority shareholders of Elementum amended certain agreements resulting in joint control of the board of directors between the Company and other non-controlling interest holders.
866374_18_ITEM8_P111_S1	As a result, the Company concluded it is no longer the primary beneficiary of Elementum and accordingly, deconsolidated the entity.
866374_18_ITEM8_P111_S2	The Company no longer recognizes the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest as a component of total shareholder s equity resulting in a reduction of $90.6 million of noncontrolling interest from its consolidated balance sheet upon deconsolidation.
866374_18_ITEM8_P111_S3	Further, the Company derecognized approximately $72.6 million of cash of Elementum as of the date of deconsolidation which is reflected as an outflow from investing activities within other investing activities, net in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2018.
866374_18_ITEM8_P111_S4	There were no other material impacts to the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated cash flows resulting from deconsolidation of the entity.
866374_18_ITEM8_P111_S5	The noncontrolling interest in the operating losses of Elementum prior to deconsolidation is immaterial for all periods presented and is classified as a component of interest and other, net, in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
866374_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	The carrying amount of the Company s variable interest in Elementum was approximately $124.6 million as of March 31, 2018, is accounted for as a cost method investment, and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
866374_18_ITEM8_P112_S1	The value of the Company s variable interest on the date of deconsolidation was based on management s estimate of the fair value of Elementum at that time.
866374_18_ITEM8_P112_S2	The Company concluded that the market approach was the most appropriate method to determine the fair value of the entity on the date of deconsolidation, given that Elementum raised equity funding from third-party investors around the same period (i.e., level 2 inputs).
866374_18_ITEM8_P112_S3	The Company recognized a gain on deconsolidation of approximately $151.6 million with no related tax impact, which is included in other charges (income), net on the consolidated statement of operations.
866374_18_ITEM8_P112_S4	As the Company is not obligated to fund future losses of Elementum, the carrying amount is the Company s maximum risk of loss.
866374_18_ITEM8_P112_S5	Pro-forma financials have not been presented because the effects were not material to the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operation for all periods presented.
866374_18_ITEM8_P112_S6	Elementum remains a related party to the Company after deconsolidation and transactions between the Company and Elementum during the year ended March 31, 2018 were immaterial.
866374_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURES The following table represents supplemental cash flow disclosures and non-cash investing and financing activities:
866374_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	BANK BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM DEBT Bank borrowings and long-term debt are as follows:
866374_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	The weighted-average interest rates for the Company's long-term debt were 3.9% and 3.5% as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P115_S1	Repayments of the Company's long-term debt are as follows:
866374_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	In August 2013, the Company entered into a $600 million term loan agreement due August 2018.
866374_18_ITEM8_P116_S1	In November 2016, the Company entered into a new arrangement to extend the maturity date of the agreement from August 30, 2018 to November 30, 2021 , and borrowed an incremental amount of $130 million under this term loan, thereby increasing the total amount under the term loan to $700 million .
866374_18_ITEM8_P116_S2	This loan is repayable in quarterly installments of $4.1 million , which commenced October 31, 2017 and continue through September 30, 2021 , with the remaining amount due at maturity.
866374_18_ITEM8_P116_S3	Borrowings under this term loan bear interest, at the Company's option, either at (i) LIBOR plus the applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranging between 1.125% and 2.125% , based on the Company's credit ratings or (ii) the base rate (the greatest of the prime rate in effect on each day as published in The Wall Street Journal, the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00% ) plus an applicable margin ranging between 0.125% and 1.125% , based on the Company's credit rating.

866374_18_ITEM8_P145_S1	A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
866374_18_ITEM8_P145_S2	The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
866374_18_ITEM8_P146_S0	Level 1 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
866374_18_ITEM8_P147_S0	The Company has deferred compensation plans for its officers and certain other employees.
866374_18_ITEM8_P147_S1	Amounts deferred under the plans are invested in hypothetical investments selected by the participant or the participant's investment manager.
866374_18_ITEM8_P147_S2	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets are included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets and include investments in equity securities that are valued using active market prices.
866374_18_ITEM8_P148_S0	Level 2 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets) such as cash and cash equivalents and money market funds; or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
866374_18_ITEM8_P149_S0	The Company values foreign exchange forward contracts using level 2 observable inputs which primarily consist of an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
866374_18_ITEM8_P149_S1	The Company's cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits and money market funds, which are valued using level 2 inputs, such as interest rates and maturity periods.
866374_18_ITEM8_P149_S2	Due to their short-term nature, their carrying amount approximates fair value.
866374_18_ITEM8_P149_S3	The Company's deferred compensation plan assets also include money market funds, mutual funds, corporate and government bonds and certain convertible securities that are valued using prices obtained from various pricing sources.
866374_18_ITEM8_P149_S4	These sources price these investments using certain market indices and the performance of these investments in relation to these indices.
866374_18_ITEM8_P149_S5	As a result, the Company has classified these investments as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
866374_18_ITEM8_P150_S0	Level 3 Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
866374_18_ITEM8_P150_S1	The Company has accrued for contingent consideration in connection with its business acquisitions as applicable, which is measured at fair value based on certain internal models and unobservable inputs.
866374_18_ITEM8_P150_S2	The significant inputs in the fair value measurement not supported by market activity included the Company's probability assessments of expected future revenue during the earn-out period and associated volatility, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligation, and calculated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.
866374_18_ITEM8_P150_S3	Significant decreases in expected revenue during the earn-out period, or significant increases in the discount rate or volatility in isolation would result in lower fair value estimates.
866374_18_ITEM8_P150_S4	The interrelationship between these inputs is not considered significant.
866374_18_ITEM8_P150_S5	The following table summarizes the activities related to contingent consideration:
866374_18_ITEM8_P151_S0	In connection with the acquisition of NEXTracker, Inc. in fiscal year 2016, the Company had an obligation to pay additional cash consideration to the former shareholders contingent upon NEXTracker, Inc.'s achievement of revenue targets during the two years after acquisition (ending on September 30, 2017).
866374_18_ITEM8_P151_S1	During fiscal year 2018, the Company paid $17.1 million of the total contingent consideration following the second year's targets achievement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.
866374_18_ITEM8_P151_S2	The payment of the contingent consideration is included in other financing activities, net, in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
866374_18_ITEM8_P151_S3	There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 .
866374_18_ITEM8_P151_S4	The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 :
866374_18_ITEM8_P152_S0	Other financial instruments The following table presents the Company's liabilities not carried at fair value as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 :
866374_18_ITEM8_P153_S0	(1) In June 2017, the Company entered into a new agreement that effectively extended the maturity date of the loan from March 31, 2019 to June 30, 2022.
866374_18_ITEM8_P153_S1	Refer to note 8 for further details of the arrangement.
866374_18_ITEM8_P154_S0	The Term Loans due November 2021 and June 2022, and the Notes due February 2020, February 2023 and June 2025 are valued based on broker trading prices in active markets.
866374_18_ITEM8_P154_S1	The Company values its Euro Term Loans due September 2020 and January 2022 based on the current market rate, and as of March 31, 2018 , the carrying amounts approximate fair values.
866374_18_ITEM8_P155_S0	COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments As of March 31, 2018 and 2017 , the gross carrying amount and associated accumulated depreciation of the Company's property and equipment financed under capital leases, and the related obligations was not material.
866374_18_ITEM8_P155_S1	The Company also leases certain of its facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.
866374_18_ITEM8_P155_S2	These operating leases expire in various years through 2035 and require the following minimum lease payments:
866374_18_ITEM8_P156_S0	Total rent expense amounted to $140.3 million , $124.7 million and $124.2 million in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P157_S0	Litigation and other legal matters In connection with the matters described below, the Company has accrued for loss contingencies where it believes that losses are probable and estimable.
866374_18_ITEM8_P157_S1	The Company does not believe that the amounts accrued are material.
866374_18_ITEM8_P157_S2	Although it is reasonably possible that actual losses could be in excess of the Company s accrual, the Company is unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of its accrual, except as discussed below, due to various reasons, including, among others, that: (i) the proceedings are in early stages or no claims has been asserted, (ii) specific damages have not been sought in all of these matters, (iii) damages, if asserted, are considered unsupported and/or exaggerated, (iv) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals, motions, or settlements, (v) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (vi) there are novel legal issues or unsettled legal theories presented.
866374_18_ITEM8_P157_S3	Any such excess loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or cash flows for a particular period or on the Company s financial condition.
866374_18_ITEM8_P158_S0	In addition, the Company provides design and engineering services to its customers and also designs and makes its own products.
866374_18_ITEM8_P158_S1	As a consequence of these activities, its customers are requiring the Company to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in its manufacturing and assembly businesses.
866374_18_ITEM8_P159_S0	Although the Company believes that its intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of its business as it currently conduct it, from time to time third parties do assert patent infringement claims against the Company or its customers.
866374_18_ITEM8_P159_S1	If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, the Company could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation.
866374_18_ITEM8_P159_S2	Such license rights might not be available to the Company on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in its favor.
866374_18_ITEM8_P159_S3	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm the Company's financial condition regardless of the outcome.
866374_18_ITEM8_P159_S4	The Company also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services.
866374_18_ITEM8_P160_S0	From time to time, the Company enters into IP licenses (e.g., patent licenses and software licenses) with third parties which obligate the Company to report covered behavior to the licensor and pay license fees to the licensor for certain activities or products, or that enable our use of third party technologies.
866374_18_ITEM8_P160_S1	The Company may also decline to enter into licenses for intellectual property that it does not think is useful for or used in its operations, or for which its customers or suppliers have licenses or have assumed responsibility.
866374_18_ITEM8_P160_S2	Given the diverse and varied nature of its business and the location of its business around the world, certain activities the Company performs, such as providing assembly services in China and India, may fall outside the scope of those licenses or may not be subject to the applicable intellectual property rights.
866374_18_ITEM8_P160_S3	The Company's licensors may disagree and claim royalties are owed for such activities.
866374_18_ITEM8_P160_S4	In addition, the basis (e.g. base price) for any royalty amounts owed are audited by licensors and may be challenged.
866374_18_ITEM8_P160_S5	Some of these disagreements, may lead to claims and litigation that might not be resolved in the Company's favor.
866374_18_ITEM8_P160_S6	Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm the Company's financial condition regardless of the outcome.
866374_18_ITEM8_P161_S0	In March 2018, the Company received an inquiry from a licensor referencing a patent license agreement, and requesting information relating to royalties for products that it assembles for a customer in China.
866374_18_ITEM8_P161_S1	If any of these inquiries result in a claim, the Company intends to contest and defend against any such claim vigorously.
866374_18_ITEM8_P161_S2	If a claim is asserted and the Company is unsuccessful in its defense, a material loss is reasonably possible.
866374_18_ITEM8_P161_S3	The Company cannot predict or estimate an amount or reasonable range of outcomes with respect to the matter.
866374_18_ITEM8_P162_S0	On May 8, 2018, a putative class action was filed in the Northern District of California against the Company and certain officers alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, promulgated thereunder, alleging misstatements and/or omissions in certain of the Company s financial results, press releases and SEC filings made during the putative class period of January 26, 2017 through April 26, 2018.
866374_18_ITEM8_P162_S1	The deadline for applications for appointment as lead plaintiff is July 9, 2018.
866374_18_ITEM8_P163_S0	On April 21, 2016, SunEdison, Inc. (together with certain of its subsidiaries, "SunEdison") filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
866374_18_ITEM8_P163_S1	During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company recognized a bad debt reserve charge of $61.0 million associated with its outstanding SunEdison receivables and accepted return of previously shipped inventory of approximately $90.0 million .
866374_18_ITEM8_P163_S2	SunEdison stated in schedules filed with the Bankruptcy Court that, within the 90 days preceding SunEdison's bankruptcy filing, the Company received approximately $98.6 million of inventory and cash transfers of $69.2 million , which in aggregate represents the Company's estimate of the maximum reasonably possible contingent loss.
866374_18_ITEM8_P164_S0	period that will end at the earlier to occur of: (a) 60 days after a party provides written notice of termination; (b) six years from the effective date of April 15, 2018; or (c) such other date as the parties may agree in writing.
866374_18_ITEM8_P164_S1	No preference claims have been asserted against the Company and consideration has been given to the related contingencies based on the facts currently known.
866374_18_ITEM8_P164_S2	The Company has a number of affirmative and direct defenses to any potential claims for recovery and intends to vigorously defend any such claim, if asserted.
866374_18_ITEM8_P164_S3	One of the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries has received related assessments for certain sales and import taxes.
866374_18_ITEM8_P164_S4	There are six tax assessments totaling 346 million Brazilian reals (approximately USD $104 million based on the exchange rate as of March 31, 2018).
866374_18_ITEM8_P164_S5	The assessments are in various stages of the review process at the administrative level and no tax proceeding has been finalized yet.
866374_18_ITEM8_P164_S6	The Company believes there is no legal basis for these assessments and has meritorious defenses and will continue to vigorously oppose all of these assessments, as well as any future assessments.
866374_18_ITEM8_P164_S7	The Company does not expect final judicial determination on any of these claims for several years.
866374_18_ITEM8_P165_S0	In addition to the matters discussed above, from time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
866374_18_ITEM8_P165_S1	The Company defends itself vigorously against any such claims.
866374_18_ITEM8_P165_S2	Although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management expects that any losses that are probable or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of these matters, which are in excess of amounts already accrued in the Company s consolidated balance sheets, would not be material to the financial statements as a whole.
866374_18_ITEM8_P166_S0	The domestic (Singapore) and foreign components of income before income taxes were comprised of the following:
866374_18_ITEM8_P167_S0	The provision for income taxes consisted of the following:
866374_18_ITEM8_P168_S0	The domestic statutory income tax rate was approximately 17.0% in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .
866374_18_ITEM8_P168_S1	The reconciliation of the income tax expense expected based on domestic statutory income tax rates to the expense for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows:
866374_18_ITEM8_P169_S0	A number of countries in which the Company is located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business.
866374_18_ITEM8_P169_S1	In general, these holidays were secured based on the nature, size and location of the Company s operations.
866374_18_ITEM8_P169_S2	The aggregate dollar effect on the Company s income resulting from tax holidays and tax incentives to attract and retain business for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $21.7 million , $15.5 million and $6.6 million , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P169_S3	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 , the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share was $0.04 and $0.04 respectively, and the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.03 and $0.03 during fiscal year 2017 , and $0.01 and $0.01 during fiscal year 2016 , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P169_S4	Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, the Company's existing holidays will expire in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 through fiscal year 2027 .
866374_18_ITEM8_P170_S0	We provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that in our estimation are not more likely than not to be realized.
866374_18_ITEM8_P170_S1	During fiscal year 2018 , 2017, and 2016 we released valuation allowances totaling $1.3 million , $39.6 million and $63.3 million , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P170_S2	For fiscal year 2018, these valuation allowance releases were primarily related to our operations in Ireland, Mexico and Taiwan as these amounts were deemed to be more likely than not to be realized due to the sustained profitability during the past three fiscal years as well as continued forecasted profitability of those subsidiaries.
866374_18_ITEM8_P170_S3	However, these valuation allowance releases were offset primarily by current period valuation allowance additions due to increased deferred tax assets as a result of current period losses in legal entities with existing full valuation allowance positions.
866374_18_ITEM8_P170_S4	For fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the offsetting amounts totaled $(65.9) million , $103.9 million and $64.3 million , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P170_S5	Included in these offsets for fiscal year 2018, the Company released $705.3 million of valuation allowance to account for the reduced deferred tax asset as a result of the lower US corporate income tax rate which became effective January 1, 2018.
866374_18_ITEM8_P170_S6	In addition, due to changes with respect to the jurisdiction s tax position during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the Company established a valuation allowance of $364.5 million for a Brazilian subsidiary which did not previously have a valuation allowance recorded.
866374_18_ITEM8_P170_S7	During fiscal year 2018, the Company recognized an income tax receivable of $53.7 million for prior period taxes paid by one of its Brazilian subsidiaries which was deemed recoverable during the period due to a favorable change in tax law whereby certain incentives are no longer includable in taxable income.
866374_18_ITEM8_P171_S0	Under its territorial tax system, Singapore generally does not tax foreign sourced income until repatriated to Singapore.
866374_18_ITEM8_P171_S1	The Company has included the effects of Singapore's territorial tax system in the rate differential line above.
866374_18_ITEM8_P171_S2	The tax effect of foreign income not repatriated to Singapore for the fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were $65.8 million , $67.9 million and $36.6 million , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P172_S0	Impact of the U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ) into law.
866374_18_ITEM8_P172_S1	Effective January 1, 2018, among other changes, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, provides for a deemed repatriation and taxation at reduced rates of certain non-US subsidiaries owned by U.S. companies historical earnings (a transition tax ), and establishes new mechanisms to tax such earnings going forward.
866374_18_ITEM8_P173_S0	Similar to other large multinational companies with complex tax structures, the Act has wide ranging implications for Flex.
866374_18_ITEM8_P174_S0	the twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2018 is immaterial, primarily because the Company has a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S., which results in there being no U.S. deferred tax assets or liabilities recorded on the balance sheet that need to be remeasured at the new 21% rate.
866374_18_ITEM8_P174_S1	Further, the Company expects that the new transition tax will be offset by foreign tax credits or net operating loss carryforwards, and thus will not result in any incremental taxes payable.
866374_18_ITEM8_P174_S2	The Company will continue to analyze the effects of the Act on its financial statements and operations.
866374_18_ITEM8_P174_S3	Any additional impacts from the enactment of the Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period provided for in Staff Bulletin 118.
866374_18_ITEM8_P175_S0	The components of deferred income taxes are as follows:
866374_18_ITEM8_P176_S0	Utilization of the Company's deferred tax assets is limited by the future earnings of the Company in the tax jurisdictions in which such deferred assets arose.
866374_18_ITEM8_P176_S1	As a result, management is uncertain as to when or whether these operations will generate sufficient profit to realize any benefit from the deferred tax assets.
866374_18_ITEM8_P177_S0	The valuation allowance provides a reserve against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized by the Company.
866374_18_ITEM8_P177_S1	However, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize certain of these benefits and, accordingly, has recognized a deferred tax asset from these benefits.
866374_18_ITEM8_P177_S2	The change in valuation allowance is net of certain increases and decreases to prior year losses and other carryforwards that have no current impact on the tax provision.
866374_18_ITEM8_P178_S0	The Company has recorded deferred tax assets of approximately $2.2 billion related to tax losses and other carryforwards against which the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for all but $81.3 million of the deferred tax assets.
866374_18_ITEM8_P178_S1	These tax losses and other carryforwards will expire at various dates as follows:
866374_18_ITEM8_P179_S0	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced or increased in the near-term if facts, including the amount of taxable income or the mix of taxable income between subsidiaries, differ from management s estimates.
866374_18_ITEM8_P179_S1	The Company does not provide for income taxes on approximately $1.6 billion of undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of Singapore as management has plans for the use of such earnings to fund certain activities outside of Singapore.
866374_18_ITEM8_P179_S2	Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
866374_18_ITEM8_P179_S3	As of March 31, 2018 , we have provided for earnings in foreign subsidiaries that are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested and therefore subject to withholding taxes on $23.1 million of undistributed foreign earnings, recording a deferred tax liability of approximately $1.7 million thereon.
866374_18_ITEM8_P179_S4	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
866374_18_ITEM8_P180_S0	The Company s unrecognized tax benefits are subject to change over the next twelve months primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and as audits are settled.
866374_18_ITEM8_P180_S1	The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by an estimated range of an additional $11 million to $41 million within the next twelve months primarily due to potential settlements of various audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.
866374_18_ITEM8_P181_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file federal, state, and local income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions around world.
866374_18_ITEM8_P181_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2007 .
866374_18_ITEM8_P181_S2	Of the $227.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2018 , $210.7 million will affect the annual effective tax rate if the benefits are eventually recognized.
866374_18_ITEM8_P181_S3	The amount that doesn t impact the ETR relates to positions that would be settled with a tax loss carryforward previously subject to a valuation allowance.
866374_18_ITEM8_P182_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within the Company s tax expense.
866374_18_ITEM8_P183_S0	approximately ($3.3) million and ($1.6) million and $(2.4) million , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P183_S1	The Company had approximately $16.2 million , $12.9 million and $14.6 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P184_S0	RESTRUCTURING CHARGES Fiscal Year 2018 During fiscal year 2018, the Company initiated targeted restructuring activities focused on optimizing our cost structure in lower growth areas and, more importantly, streamlining certain corporate and segment functions.
866374_18_ITEM8_P184_S1	Restructuring charges are recorded based upon employee termination dates, site closure and consolidation plans generally in conjunction with an overall corporate initiative to drive cost reduction and realign the Company's global footprint.
866374_18_ITEM8_P185_S0	The Company recognized approximately $78.6 million of cash charges predominantly related to related to employee severance costs and $12.1 million of non-cash charges for asset impairment and other exit charges under the above plan.
866374_18_ITEM8_P185_S1	Of these total charges, approximately $66.8 million was recognized in cost of sales.
866374_18_ITEM8_P185_S2	Employee severance costs were associated with the terminations of 6,203 identified employees.
866374_18_ITEM8_P185_S3	The identified employee terminations by reportable geographic region amounted to approximately 5,336 , 741 and 126 for the Americas, Asia and Europe, respectively.
866374_18_ITEM8_P185_S4	A majority of the fiscal year 2018 restructuring activities were completed as of March 31, 2018.
866374_18_ITEM8_P185_S5	Restructuring charges are not included in segment income, as disclosed further in note 20.
866374_18_ITEM8_P185_S6	The components of the restructuring charges by geographic region incurred in fiscal year 2018 are as follows:
866374_18_ITEM8_P186_S0	During fiscal year 2017, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to accelerate its ability to support more Sketch-to-Scale tm efforts across the Company and reposition away from historical legacy programs and structures through rationalizing its current footprint at existing sites and at corporate SG A functions.
866374_18_ITEM8_P186_S1	The Company recognized restructuring charges of approximately $49.4 million primarily for employee termination costs under the above plan.

866374_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2018.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2018, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, as a result of the material weaknesses further described below, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Notwithstanding such material weaknesses, which is described below in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, our management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	(b) Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting consists of policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) are designed and operated to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and our process for the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements or prevent or detect instances of fraud.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P1_S3	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P1_S5	The projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	As of March 31, 2018 , under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation was conducted of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").
866374_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Management's annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018 excluded the internal control over financial reporting of one of our acquisitions that was completed during the year ended March 31, 2018 , which constitutes less than 1% of both total assets and net sales of the consolidated financial statements amount as of, and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 .
866374_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	(c) Material Weaknesses Identified Our management concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, material weaknesses existed in our internal control over financial reporting.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	These deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and aggregated to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the accounting for customer contractual obligations and aspects of our control environment and monitoring activities.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P3_S3	We determined that there was insufficient documentation of, and ineffective design of controls over, the accounting for accrued customer obligations related to customer contracts.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Factors contributing to this included insufficient training of site and segment operational and accounting personnel, and inadequate monitoring, including contract compliance, to ensure the components of internal control were present and functioning properly.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P3_S5	In addition, the control environment was ineffective in ensuring that executive management s expectations of adherence to the Company s policies and standards of conduct were followed at all levels of the Company and in ensuring that any deviations therefrom were identified and corrected in a timely manner.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P3_S6	As a result of these material weaknesses, our management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P3_S7	(d) Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weaknesses Management is committed to the planning and implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses, as well as to foster continuous improvement in the Company s internal controls.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P3_S8	We have undertaken, and will continue to undertake, steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting to address and remediate the material weaknesses.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P3_S9	The remediation efforts and actions to address the deficiencies identified above are summarized below.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P3_S10	Some of these remediation efforts have been implemented already or are in the process of implementation, and the details to address the material weaknesses and to enhance our overall financial control environment will be finalized over the coming months.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Design and implement additional site level controls related to accounting for customer contractual obligations including criteria for effective contract reviews and approvals and documentation to evidence judgements and estimates.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Designing and implementing a centralized Contract Management Office to determine the appropriate accounting and provide evidence of review for each material contract.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Designing and implementing systematic centralized reporting controls that provide enhanced visibility to the accounting for customer contracts, which improve monitoring controls that are designed to prevent or detect material errors and help ensure that proper oversight is being provided related to certain decentralized activities.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Enhancing the quality and frequency of training across all levels to improve awareness of Company policies and knowledge of the expected standards of conduct.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P8_S0	While this remediation plan is being executed, the Company has also engaged additional external resources to support and supplement the Company s existing internal resources.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Management believes these measures, when fully implemented and operational, will remediate the control deficiencies we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P8_S2	The material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls operate for a sufficient period and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P8_S3	We are working to have the material weaknesses remediated as soon as possible.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P8_S4	As we continue to evaluate and improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies or modify or change the proposed remediation measures described above.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P9_S0	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P10_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Flex Ltd.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Flex Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
866374_18_ITEM9A_P11_S1	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P11_S2	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2018, of the Company and our report dated June 14, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P11_S3	As described in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of one acquisition completed during the year ended March 31, 2018, which constitutes less than 1% of both assets and net sales of the consolidated financial statements amount as of, and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P11_S4	Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting of this acquisition.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P12_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P12_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB (United States).
866374_18_ITEM9A_P12_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P12_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P12_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P13_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P13_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P13_S2	Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting, may not prevent or detect misstatements.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P13_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P14_S0	Material Weaknesses A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P14_S1	The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management s assessment: There was insufficient documentation of, and ineffective design of controls over, the accounting for accrued customer obligations related to customer contracts.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P14_S2	Factors contributing to this included insufficient training of site and segment operational and accounting personnel, and inadequate monitoring, including of contract compliance, to ensure the components of internal control were present and functioning properly.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P14_S3	In addition, the control environment was ineffective in ensuring that executive management s expectations of adherence to the Company s policies and standards of conduct were followed at all levels of the Company and in ensuring that any deviations therefrom were identified and corrected in a timely manner.
866374_18_ITEM9A_P14_S4	These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2018 and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements.
